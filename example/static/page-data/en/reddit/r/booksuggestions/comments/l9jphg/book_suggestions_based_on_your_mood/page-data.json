It is a AI powered search engine for books called librimood (<a href=\"https://librimood.com/\">https://librimood.com/</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Basically it&#39;s a search engine where you can search freely about what you like to read, just like asking a friend or asking this subreddit. That means that you can write complex queries and find books matching your mood.</p>\n\n<p>For example you can write a very specific query like the &quot;a book with a female protagonist fighting monsters&quot; or a super abstract one like &quot;a book that will make me cry” and our algorithm will give you some interesting results! </p>\n\n<p>Now, sometimes the results might be a bit off or unexpected, but we are currently working on making it better and expanding the number of available books!</p>\n\n<p>Try it out and tell us what you think!
