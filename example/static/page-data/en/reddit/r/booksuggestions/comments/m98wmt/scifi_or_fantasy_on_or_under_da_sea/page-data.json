In fact, my parents used to read me a glow-in-the-dark picture book about an undersea lab (if anybody knows the title of <em>that</em> book I would be ecstatic) </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a big believer in giving books away to friends,selling them on the cheap to used bookstores, or donating to a library. I&#39;m a &quot;Books are meant to be read!&quot; Kinda guy.\n...except. Except when it comes to books about H2O and the sea. Those, I horde ferociously.</p>\n\n<p>I am making a little library/office with my nautical charts and some oceanic knickknacks I&#39;ve picked up over the years but my main goal is to fill the room with aquabooks. In fact, screw the knickknacks! Just books and maps.\n I have plenty of coffee table books on diving and sailing, coral and fishes, Costeau this, Costeau that. I have books on hurricanes in the Atlantic and shipwrecks in the Great Lakes, books on boatbuilding and repair, Islands tropical, temperate, and frozen stiff. I have books on seamonsters, lakemonsters, and rivermonsters. I&#39;ve got <em>Life on the Mississippi</em> leaning against a text book on subsea volcanology. I&#39;ve read many and certainly perused all of these books, but what I have definitely read 100% of are my fun ocean fictions and I NEED more.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my collection this far: (I wrote these all down this a.m. just for you guys)</p>\n\n<p><em>A Darkling Sea by</em> James Cambias (I really liked this one)</p>\n\n<p><em>OceanSpace</em> by Allen Steele</p>\n\n<p><em>Saturn&#39;s Race</em> by Larry Niven &amp; Steven Barnes</p>\n\n<p><em>The Ghost from the Grand Banks</em> by Arthur C. Clark.</p>\n\n<p><em>The Kingdom Beyond the Waves</em> by Stephen Hunt</p>\n\n<p><em>Undersea City</em> Frederick Pohl &amp; Jack Williamson</p>\n\n<p><em>Undersea Fleet</em> Frederick Pohl &amp; Jack Williamson</p>\n\n<p><em>Undersea Quest</em> by Frederick Pohl &amp; Jack Williamson</p>\n\n<p><em>Dome</em> by Michael Reeves &amp; Steve Perry</p>\n\n<p><em>Sea Siege</em> by Andre Norton</p>\n\n<p><em>Home from the Shore</em> by Gordon R Dickson</p>\n\n<p><em>Land&#39;s End</em> by Frederick Pohl &amp; Jack Williamson</p>\n\n<p><em>Sundiver</em> by David Brin</p>\n\n<p><em>Startide Rising</em> by David Brin</p>\n\n<p>Kindle editions I own but am hunting for paper:</p>\n\n<p><em>Sphere</em> by Michael Crichton</p>\n\n<p>🐬 <em>Dolphin Island</em> by Arthur C. Clark</p>\n\n<p><em>The Deep Range</em> by Arthur C. Clark</p>\n\n<p><em>Crisis on Conshelf 10</em> by Monica Hughes (I think there might be a whole series)</p>\n\n<p><em>Under Pressure</em> by Frank Herbert</p>\n\n<p><em>The Dragon in the Sea</em> by Frank Herbert</p>\n\n<p><em>Beyond the Rift</em> by Peter Watts</p>\n\n<p><em>Ship Breaker</em> by Paolo Bacigalup</p>\n\n<p><em>The Drowned World</em> by J.G. Ballard</p>\n\n<p><em>Blackfish City</em> by Sam J. Miller</p>\n\n<p><em>NY 2140</em> by Kim Stanley Robinson</p>\n\n<p><em>The Enceladus Mission</em> by Brandon Q. Morris</p>\n\n<p><em>Undersea</em> by Geoffrey Morrison</p>\n\n<p><em>Deep Fathom</em> by James Rollins</p>\n\n<p><em>Romulus Buckle</em> and the Luminiferous Aether by Richard Ellis Preston Jr.</p>\n\n<p><em>Solaris</em> by Stanislaw Lem</p>\n\n<p><em>Flotilla</em> by Daniel Haight</p>\n\n<p><em>Breakthrough</em> by Michael C. Grumley</p>\n\n<p><em>The Atopia Chronicles</em> by Matthew Mather</p>\n\n<p><em>007 The Spy Who Loved Me</em> by Ian Flemming⁶</p>\n\n<p>Of course!... <em>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</em> by Jules Verne (I&#39;d like to find a cool illustrated hardback)</p>\n\n<p>-So, I&#39;ve never read a Clive Cussler. I haven&#39;t heard great reviews from a literary standpoint, but I have also heard they are fun and my undersea collection certainly could not leave them out. I&#39;m waiting to find a pallet of them at a garage sale so I can snatch &#39;em up at once, but if anyone has recommendations for specific ones that&#39;d be awesome. I think there are like 50 titles. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m excited to read what you&#39;ve got for me <a href=\"/r/booksuggestions\">r/booksuggestions</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/m98wmt/scifi_or_fantasy_on_or_under_da_sea/","title":"SciFi or Fantasy on or under da Sea! 🌊 🦈⛵","tags":["booksuggestions","reddit"],"date":"March 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-20T19:05:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-20 19:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"918a6be9-2693-570c-8cac-e0efa7c5ddcb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/m98wmt/scifi_or_fantasy_on_or_under_da_sea/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/m98wmt/scifi_or_fantasy_on_or_under_da_sea/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"booksuggestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions","author":"mighty_least_weasel","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mighty_least_weasel","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"mighty_least_weasel","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"在海洋上或海底的科幻或幻想! 🌊 🦈⛵","the_new_excerpt":"我在海洋领域工作，从我懂事起就喜欢大海、湖泊和河流。\n记得。事实上，我的父母经常给我读一本夜光图画书。\n关于海底实验室（如果有人知道那本书的名字，我将会是......）。\n欣喜若狂)\n\n我很相信送书给朋友，卖书... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在海洋上或海底的科幻或幻想! 🌊 🦈⛵","the_new_excerpt":"我在海洋領域工作，從我懂事起就喜歡大海、湖泊和河流。\n記得。事實上，我的父母經常給我讀一本夜光圖畫書。\n關於海底實驗室（如果有人知道那本書的名字，我將會是......）。\n欣喜若狂)\n\n我很相信送書給朋友，賣書... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6713acea-e2a7-51db-998d-19c0eff72246","excerpt":"With good overall content of course, no preference for genre.
