There are plenty of other decent bookstores in the city, but Powell&#39;s simply has the best collection due to its tremendous size. </p>\n\n<p>Well they shut down on March 14, but they did reopen the 1st floor (<em>they have 3 floors</em>) a few months ago which was great. Plenty of precautions and whatnot, but it was wonderful to be back in there. The 1st floor, however, is about 1/3 a kids/YA section and the majority of the rest is fiction and gifts. As fun as it is to browse their fiction books, including their legendary sci-fi section, what I really longed for was the non-fiction sections on the 2nd floor. </p>\n\n<p>Yesterday Powell&#39;s announced their 2nd floor is opening up TODAY! It&#39;s a sense of relief and pure joy to be able to go back up there today. I just had to share this with some folks who would understand.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lt20l1/you_cannot_imagine_the_relief_i_feel_with_my/","title":"You cannot imagine the relief I feel with my large, local bookstore (Powell's in Portland) opening up their 2nd floor today!","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-26T18:57:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-26 18:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"eb3a01ba-9de6-5584-b51e-990b6760a43b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lt20l1/you_cannot_imagine_the_relief_i_feel_with_my/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lt20l1/you_cannot_imagine_the_relief_i_feel_with_my/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"WinesburgOhio","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/WinesburgOhio","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"WinesburgOhio","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你无法想象我的大型本地书店(波特兰的Powell's)今天开出了他们的二楼，我感到很欣慰!","the_new_excerpt":"作为一个住在波特兰Powell's附近的狂热的步行者和读者，我曾经。\n每周定期浏览该书店多次。有很多\n但鲍威尔书店有最好的。\n收集由于其巨大的规模。\n\n他们在3月关闭了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你無法想象我的大型本地書店(波特蘭的Powell's)今天開出了他們的二樓，我感到很欣慰!","the_new_excerpt":"作爲一個住在波特蘭Powell's附近的狂熱的步行者和讀者，我曾經。\n每週定期瀏覽該書店多次。有很多\n但鮑威爾書店有最好的。\n收集由於其巨大的規模。\n\n他們在3月關閉了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-4711b0c1-34d4-5234-a95e-e575edafb8b2","excerpt":"Could be romance, preferably with a slow burn, or any other genre.
