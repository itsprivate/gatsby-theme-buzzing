In their eyes “justice and the right arm of the law” have failed them. Either by not lending a hand, or not providing true repercussions for certain actions. For example: Can’t make a house payment because you had to spend it on your partner for a life saving operation? “Tough luck son,” says society.\n But you go to The Godfather and he will help you out. He finds out that you own a gardening business and five years later your repaid favor is: help him grow and tend for his garden. \nAgain, I’m not supporting criminal actions, but I can understand the temptation to make a deal with the devil when god (society and its rules) have abandoned you. What do you folks think? Do you agree? Disagree?
