This in turn made me avoid it as much as I could so my literacy sufferd too. </p>\n\n<p>When I was in my early teens I managed to read a couple of Terry Pratchet books that my Grandad recommended but I was never hooked by them. </p>\n\n<p>I found that if I hit a slow patch in a book even if I was really enjoying it that it would be too much effort and I would put it down and never pick it up again. </p>\n\n<p>Since I started with audio books last year I have finished more books than I&#39;ve ever fished the entire Harry Potter series, Hyperion, Fall of Hyperion, Endimion, A Scanner Darkly, Kitchen Confidential, Ring world, Dune, IT and Salems Lot. That&#39;s more bookes in a year and a bit than I&#39;ve ever read in my life.</p>\n\n<p>I can not get enough, I look forward to doing tedious housework because it means crack on with a book. I understand the hype behinde the likes of Harry Potter, I was never blown away by the films but my friends always said the books were way better. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve always wanted to read Stephan Kings IT but when I saw my sister read it when I was younger, I always thought &quot;There&#39;s no way I can read that many pages&quot;. Currently on Prisoners of Geography as recommended by a friend and then I&#39;m going to tackle Jaws.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: The Terror by Dan Simmons. How could I forget, Absolutely loved it. Was hooked by the first chapter.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/llu6e5/last_year_i_decided_to_give_audio_books_a_try_and/","title":"Last year I decided to give audio books a try and it's changed my life.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-17T15:39:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-17 15:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"2dc2a58c-f0f5-5b25-a27e-ce22a08d70a8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/llu6e5/last_year_i_decided_to_give_audio_books_a_try_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/llu6e5/last_year_i_decided_to_give_audio_books_a_try_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"OrangeJoe89","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/OrangeJoe89","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"OrangeJoe89","score":66,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"去年，我决定尝试一下有声读物，它改变了我的生活。","the_new_excerpt":"我有精神分裂症，所以小时候我觉得阅读很困惑，很沮丧。这本\n反过来又让我尽可能地避免它，所以我的识字量也受到了影响。\n\n当我十几岁的时候，我设法读了几本特里-普拉特谢的书。\n我爷爷推荐的，但我从来没有被他们迷住。\n\n我发现...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"去年，我決定嘗試一下有聲讀物，它改變了我的生活。","the_new_excerpt":"我有精神分裂症，所以小時候我覺得閱讀很困惑，很沮喪。這本\n反過來又讓我儘可能地避免它，所以我的識字量也受到了影響。\n\n當我十幾歲的時候，我設法讀了幾本特里-普拉特謝的書。\n我爺爺推薦的，但我從來沒有被他們迷住。\n\n我發現...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-302d1fd9-99db-5100-8ba0-ab2573402857","excerpt":"I got inspired by the question about books we loved as teens and realized were\nterrible, I’d like to know the opposite.
