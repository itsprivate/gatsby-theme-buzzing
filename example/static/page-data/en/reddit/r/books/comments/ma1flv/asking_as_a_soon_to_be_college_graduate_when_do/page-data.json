I was one of those shy kids in school who had books as a form of solace. Even when I got older in high school, though the number decreased, I still managed to read a lot. Covid has been quite the ordeal for everyone, but one plus side is having more time to read. I&#39;ve spent all of quarantine doing college classes online from my parents&#39;s house (another bonus with covid: the chance to spend more time with them) and I&#39;ve slowly worked my way through my Dad&#39;s personal library: I&#39;m currently about to finish Graham Greene&#39;s <em>The End of the Affair</em> and Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#39;s <em>Crime and Punishment.</em></p>\n\n<p>I have one more semester in the fall and then I&#39;m done with college. Graduate school might be an option, but it&#39;s looking like I&#39;ll be working professionally before I take that direction. Obviously I&#39;m very excited for the future, but I am a bit nervous. Beyond finding a job, making rent, and larger questions like &quot;What do I want to accomplish?&quot;, I&#39;ve been worried about some of my personal favorite pastimes. And this is where my love for reading comes in.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m worried that I won&#39;t have any more time to read again for fun. I&#39;m a film major specifically, and I know the industry can be taxing time wise. I want to be able to have my cake and eat it too: to be able to pursue the career that I want while managing to have a social life AND continuing with my explorations in the wide world of literature.</p>\n\n<p>This is essentially just a roundabout way of asking this: <strong>adults of</strong> <a href=\"/r/books\">r/books</a>, when do you guys find the time to read? Lunch breaks? At night before going to bed?** I&#39;d genuinely love to know! Each and every response will be genuinely appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ma1flv/asking_as_a_soon_to_be_college_graduate_when_do/","title":"Asking as a soon to be college graduate: When do \"adults\" (people with professional jobs) find the time to read?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-22T04:03:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-22 04:03","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"cd649c7a-6f1b-54be-a9c6-68a6d9802c28","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ma1flv/asking_as_a_soon_to_be_college_graduate_when_do/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ma1flv/asking_as_a_soon_to_be_college_graduate_when_do/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"thewickerstan","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/thewickerstan","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"thewickerstan","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"作为一个即将毕业的大学生来问。\"成年人\"（有专业工作的人）什么时候才有时间读书？","the_new_excerpt":"如果这显得是一个幼稚的问题，请原谅。\n\n我喜欢阅读。一直以来都是，将来也是。我是那些害羞的孩子之一，在\n学校谁有书本作为一种慰藉。即使我长大了，在高中的时候。\n虽然数量减少了，但我还是读了很多书。Covid已经相当\n煎熬","locale":"zh"},{"title":"作爲一個即將畢業的大學生來問。\"成年人\"（有專業工作的人）什麼時候纔有時間讀書？","the_new_excerpt":"如果這顯得是一個幼稚的問題，請原諒。\n\n我喜歡閱讀。一直以來都是，將來也是。我是那些害羞的孩子之一，在\n學校誰有書本作爲一種慰藉。即使我長大了，在高中的時候。\n雖然數量減少了，但我還是讀了很多書。Covid已經相當\n煎熬","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-9be6d5f5-3ad8-5973-875d-5ccec956b896","excerpt":"In general, I'm from the follow-your-excitement school of reading.
