It was so well written. I loved that it was narrarated by death in nazi Germany. The characters were so well rounded and all had wonderful arcs.

I would like to hope that the husband they mention in the last chapter is Max. They take care of each other so well. Ugh. I can&#39;t get over this book. Anyway.
