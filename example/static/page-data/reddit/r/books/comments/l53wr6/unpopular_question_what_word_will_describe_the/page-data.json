I know it&#39;s just semantics, but language is here to provide clarity to our experiences, why do we make this so confusing. What&#39;s wrong with the word &quot;listening&quot;? </p>\n\n<p><strong>One is not better than the other. Nobody cares. But they</strong> <strong><em>are</em></strong> <strong>different.</strong> Both people are consuming the exact same material however the means of the journey is different. Why do we insist on making them the same. It&#39;s just confusing.</p>\n\n<p>If you read Harry Potter to your newborn baby to fall asleep, would you go around telling your friends that your <strong>baby can read</strong>? No, because reading is something we learn, something we are taught in school...it is a wonderful thing that brings its own unique feelings and life skills. Why is this experience being removed from our lexicon? How do we tell our kids it&#39;s important to learn to read, if we don&#39;t even have a word for it?</p>\n\n<p>If one person hikes up a mountain, and the other takes a gondola...they both saw the same things, they both reached the same places, but the method was different. We use different words because they give us more information and clarity. It&#39;s the beauty and power of language in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;d be like if we got rid of the words: drive, bike, and walk. And instead called every journey from A to B <em>walking</em> from now on. If that happened  I made a post about it, would I be crazy? Maybe? I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m just confused why I am an asshole for this opinion. Aren&#39;t I allowed to have a word for the experience we used to call reading? That&#39;s all I&#39;m asking for.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l53wr6/unpopular_question_what_word_will_describe_the/","title":"Unpopular question.
