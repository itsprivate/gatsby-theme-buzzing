I used to read a lot and I&#39;m talking upwards of 100 books a year but as high school became increasingly hard, I had to cut down. Or maybe that was just an excuse because I found myself repeatedly turning to Netflix and Youtube for entertainment and I was never able to find that satisfaction that reading gave me. </p>\n\n<p>Last year I managed to read all of 4 books and that too only in the first few months as I had a bit more time on my hands then. This year, I hadn&#39;t read a single book completely despite the fact I got a kindle in the hope that I could awaken the love I had for reading. Last week however I decided that if I really wanted to read, I have to sincerely take some action towards it and I blocked Netflix and other streaming sites and decided that I was going to actively reduce them out of my life while increasing the time I spend reading. At first, I was ashamed by how hard it was for me to pick a book up even though I had nothing else to do. I&#39;d prefer to sit bored rather than pick a book up. However yesterday I decided I would try to pick up a book that I had read many years before in the hopes that it would reduce the friction and it most certainly did. I picked up Russian Roulette by Anthony Horowitz and while I found it a bit childish now, I felt really nostalgic as I read it and most importantly it reawoke that passion I had for reading. </p>\n\n<p>I had forgotten how amazing it was to be obsessed with a book, so much so that I stayed up the entire night to finish it and when I was done, I felt the familiar satisfaction I had gotten from reading all those years ago. I intend to continue reading the rest of the year and while it might be a bit late for me to finish my original goal of 52 books this year (I&#39;m in my last year of high school which only gets over in July), I most certainly want to give it a shot. To all those of you struggling to get back into reading, I implore you to turn off all other sources of distraction if you&#39;re serious about it and make sure you really try to get back into reading. You&#39;ll be amazed by how better you&#39;ll feel after.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m8ebjj/i_finally_read_a_book_after_a_long_time_and_i/","title":"I finally read a book after a long time and I realized how much I'd been missing out on","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-19T14:24:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-19 14:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"667f4e34-56e3-5242-9043-19ca43bf3991","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m8ebjj/i_finally_read_a_book_after_a_long_time_and_i/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m8ebjj/i_finally_read_a_book_after_a_long_time_and_i/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"sudi81","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/sudi81","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"sudi81","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"时隔许久，我终于读到了一本书，我才发现自己错过了多少东西。","the_new_excerpt":"这也许并不是什么大成就，但过了很久，我。\n成功地设法坐下来读完一本书。我以前经常看书，而且我...\n一年说起来有100多本，但随着高中越来越难。\n我必须减少开支 也许这只是一个借口，因为我... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"時隔許久，我終於讀到了一本書，我才發現自己錯過了多少東西。","the_new_excerpt":"這也許並不是什麼大成就，但過了很久，我。\n成功地設法坐下來讀完一本書。我以前經常看書，而且我...\n一年說起來有100多本，但隨着高中越來越難。\n我必須減少開支 也許這只是一個藉口，因爲我... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-93dcb8e6-827e-5906-ac54-94ada2bb4304","excerpt":"My wife and I just watched our friends lose a 5-week long battle with their\ndaughter in the NICU, and it’s shaken us both up a fair bit.\n\nMy wife wants to read a book that is light hearted.
