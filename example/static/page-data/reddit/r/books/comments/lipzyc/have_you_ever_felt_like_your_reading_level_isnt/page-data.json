It&#39;s beautifully written, has great characters, and is just a great book so far, but dear lord it makes me feel dumb sometimes. I&#39;ve lost count of how many paragraphs I&#39;ve had to reread just to try and understand what&#39;s happening. Obviously anything worth while is going to be challenging, but I feel like I&#39;m doing the book a disservice by not understanding everything about it. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe this book isn&#39;t tough for the average reader, but for me it&#39;s the most challenging book I&#39;ve read. It&#39;s rewarding, but also disheartening... if that makes sense. I honestly feel like I&#39;m missing a good amount of the story. Maybe I&#39;ll be more confident on a reread?</p>\n\n<p>Long story short... I&#39;m loving the book, but having a tough time with it. Have any of you experienced these feelings about a book?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lipzyc/have_you_ever_felt_like_your_reading_level_isnt/","title":"Have you ever felt like your reading level isn't high enough for a specific book?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-13T06:19:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-13 06:19","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"70ac4389-ddf0-5a57-88c8-cf2bb65856df","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lipzyc/have_you_ever_felt_like_your_reading_level_isnt/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lipzyc/have_you_ever_felt_like_your_reading_level_isnt/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"APwilliams88","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/APwilliams88","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"APwilliams88","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你有没有觉得自己的阅读水平不够高，不适合看某本书？","the_new_excerpt":"科马克-麦卡锡写的《血色子午线》我读了160页，我真的\n爱上了它。它写得很美，人物也很好，就是一个很好的。\n这本书到目前为止，但亲爱的主 它让我觉得自己有时哑巴。我已经数不清\n多少段我不得不重读 只是为了尝试和... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你有沒有覺得自己的閱讀水平不夠高，不適合看某本書？","the_new_excerpt":"科馬克-麥卡錫寫的《血色子午線》我讀了160頁，我真的\n愛上了它。它寫得很美，人物也很好，就是一個很好的。\n這本書到目前爲止，但親愛的主 它讓我覺得自己有時啞巴。我已經數不清\n多少段我不得不重讀 只是爲了嘗試和... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3425f329-c20c-51df-b6f2-2da8954141e1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lirx7s/libby_is_stuck_between_libraries_and_publishers/","title":"Libby is stuck between libraries and publishers in the e-book war","date":"February 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"电子书大战中，Libby夹在图书馆和出版商之间。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"電子書大戰中，Libby夾在圖書館和出版商之間。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-85337b3a-ebac-50f7-a608-5e0559b256e4","excerpt":"I'm a introverted 22 y/o guy and I want to break out of my overly\ncynical/skeptical shell!
