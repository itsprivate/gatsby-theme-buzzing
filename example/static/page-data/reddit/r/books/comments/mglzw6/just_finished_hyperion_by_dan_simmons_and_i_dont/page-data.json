The private investigator’s story was okay and the poets story I thought was kinda lame. So essentially, half of the book was amazing and the other half I rolled my eyes at the 15 sex scenes throughout. I mean, I don’t mind sex in books but it was a little much and not very well written in my opinion. But the ENDING made me mad. Holding hands and singing the freaking Wizard of Oz... are you kidding me dude. I don’t know, it felt so cheesy to me and I felt like I wasted my time. </p>\n\n<p>So after I dealt with my emotions on the ending of this book, I look up reviews for the book and literally everyone is loving it. I seemed to be the only one who didn’t think it was the bee’s knees. It wasn’t the worst book I’ve ever read but it certainly wasn’t a 10/10. </p>\n\n<p>How did you guys feel about Hyperion?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mglzw6/just_finished_hyperion_by_dan_simmons_and_i_dont/","title":"Just finished Hyperion by Dan Simmons and I don’t know what to think.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-31T02:53:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-31 02:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"dcdfd846-2c06-5ca8-a2ff-ee4d3ceab451","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mglzw6/just_finished_hyperion_by_dan_simmons_and_i_dont/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mglzw6/just_finished_hyperion_by_dan_simmons_and_i_dont/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"TyrionGannister","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TyrionGannister","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"TyrionGannister","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"刚看完丹-西蒙斯的《海伯利安》，我不知道该怎么想。","the_new_excerpt":"神父的故事很吸引人，父亲的故事很耐人寻味，甚至是\n领事的故事很好。私家侦探的故事还不错，而那个...\n诗人的故事，我认为是有点跛脚。所以基本上，这本书的一半是\n惊人的另一半，我翻了我的眼睛在15个性爱场景... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"剛看完丹-西蒙斯的《海伯利安》，我不知道該怎麼想。","the_new_excerpt":"神父的故事很吸引人，父親的故事很耐人尋味，甚至是\n領事的故事很好。私家偵探的故事還不錯，而那個...\n詩人的故事，我認爲是有點跛腳。所以基本上，這本書的一半是\n驚人的另一半，我翻了我的眼睛在15個性愛場景... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-c2a518b4-fea0-5a72-bb99-9ff092eedf99","excerpt":"I do not mean them to have a controversial topic (Rape, Incest, body torture\netc) but just good ass reads with great story that makes you wonder about things\nor keep you on your toes.\nOne book I read that was like this (as in different and quirky) was house of\nLeaves by Mark Z.
