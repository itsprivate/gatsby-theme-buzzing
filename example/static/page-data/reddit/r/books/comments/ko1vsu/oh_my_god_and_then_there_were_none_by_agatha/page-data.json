That has to be the most ingenious and best mystery book I’ve ever read. I have been sitting here for half an hour trying to compute what I just read. I cannot express in words how bloody amazing it was. You all must read it! Christie really is the queen of mystery. \n🤯🤯🤯🤯😭😭😭😭</p>\n\n<p>For those of you who aren’t aware, it is a mystery story where 10 strangers are invited to an island, on which they become stranded, and they start getting picked off one by one. \nI also thought it was so incredibly chilling, more so than most of her other books too. The way she wove the web of mystery, skullduggery and suspense was masterful. The nursery rhyme also added a sense of impending doom to myself as the reader. Really clever utilisation of dramatic irony. And the ending was just a punch to the balls! \nI am not surprised in the slightest that this is the highest selling mystery book of all time!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you all so much for the other recommendations. Once I’ve finished all the other books on my list - I’ve got 40 - I’ll get round to all these. They all sound amazing!</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: I’m so glad I convinced so many of you to pick the book up. I hope you all enjoy it and be sure to return to this post and leave your thoughts when you’re finished! However, I recommend starting on ‘The Murder of Roger Ackoryd’, if you haven’t read any Agatha Christie before - it’s a better introduction to her work. Then read ‘And Then There Were None’.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: some people thought i included a spoiler when it wasn’t so to shut them up i’ve removed it. and also, to the trolls - shush.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 4 (god I’m doing a lot of these 😅): thanks to those of you recommended the BBC/Charles Dance adaptation. It was good. I wish they had made it more true to the book, but it was still enjoyable viewing. Charles Dance was excellent. After you’ve finished the book, you ought to watch it. Felt that it wasn’t as chilling as the book, but that might just be because I know the ending lol.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ko1vsu/oh_my_god_and_then_there_were_none_by_agatha/","title":"Oh my god ‘and then there were none’ by Agatha Christie had me throwing the book across the room 🤯🤯","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T03:12:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 03:12","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"78346fe8-485c-58b9-abd3-cbfa8ca1fead","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ko1vsu/oh_my_god_and_then_there_were_none_by_agatha/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ko1vsu/oh_my_god_and_then_there_were_none_by_agatha/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Comprehensive_Path17","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Comprehensive_Path17","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Comprehensive_Path17","score":10138,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我的天啊，阿加莎-克里斯蒂写的 \"当时没有人 \"让我把书扔到了房间的另一边 🤯🤯","the_new_excerpt":"刚说完'然后就没有了'。这一定是最巧妙的，也是最好的\n我读过的最好的神秘书。我已经在这里坐了半个小时了\n试图计算我刚才读到的东西。我无法用言语来表达我所看到的\n它是。你们一定要看！克里斯蒂真的是女王的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的天啊，阿加莎-克里斯蒂寫的 \"當時沒有人 \"讓我把書扔到了房間的另一邊 🤯🤯","the_new_excerpt":"剛說完'然後就沒有了'。這一定是最巧妙的，也是最好的\n我讀過的最好的神祕書。我已經在這裏坐了半個小時了\n試圖計算我剛纔讀到的東西。我無法用言語來表達我所看到的\n它是。你們一定要看！克里斯蒂真的是女王的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-54b0ce71-de1a-5230-baba-3b213dc4a9bc","excerpt":"I was doing some reading about the history of Shrek\n[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/Shrekcover.jpg] (long story),\nand learned that it was a children’s book written ten years before the movie\ncame out.\n\nNot only that, but it was written by William Steig--who you might recognize as\n1.…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/kocewk/shrek_was_a_book/","title":"Shrek was a book?!","date":"January 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"史莱克是一本书？","the_new_excerpt":"我读了一些关于史莱克历史的书\n[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/Shrekcover.jpg]（说来话长）。\n并得知这是一本比电影早十年写的儿童读物\n出来了。\n\n不仅如此，这本书的作者是威廉-斯蒂格，你可能会认出他是谁。\n1.…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"史萊克是一本書？","the_new_excerpt":"我讀了一些關於史萊克歷史的書\n[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/Shrekcover.jpg]（說來話長）。\n並得知這是一本比電影早十年寫的兒童讀物\n出來了。\n\n不僅如此，這本書的作者是威廉-斯蒂格，你可能會認出他是誰。\n1.…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-c2247563-7bff-5a12-b332-5859f0616305","excerpt":"Looking for suggestions for non-fictional books that have made a significant\nimpact in your daily lives as well as leaving an impression that you learned\nsomething new.
