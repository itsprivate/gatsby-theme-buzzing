I could read almost any type of book in any type of genre. I could not walk past a bookstore without going in, and if there was a sale, you bet I was buying.</p>\n\n<p>As I grow older, I still loved books and would still buy them, thinking I for sure was going to read it, but knowing deep down, that I would start but not finish, or maybe not even start. Things always got in the way, school, friends, work, laziness (I also love watching movies and tv-shows, and it was always just easier to go to the movies or stream something.) I would still read and finish some books, but not as many as I would like to. And those I would finish, would be the next in a book series, so I was already in that universe. (if that makes sense.) But I had lost my joy of entering a new world.  </p>\n\n<p>So after seeing posts like “started reading again,” and “found my love for reading.” I decided that, now it was my turn to work on my love for reading, so last Monday, I picked up a random book from my bookshelf, and slowly started reading. It’s been almost a week, and I am almost finished (Happy dance), I found myself wanting to read more, and thinking “just one more chapter,” even though I really should go to bed. (just like I use to do as a teen.)</p>\n\n<p>I know myself well enough to know, that if I don’t keep working on it, I will just go back to getting books, I want to read, but in the end won’t get to read. I really do want to keep this up, so I have to thank you reddit, for giving me some will to try and find my love of reading again. </p>\n\n<p>Thank You. </p>\n\n<p>Also please let me know if you have redescovered books, and what helped you get back into it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l8kk8k/working_on_my_love_for_reading_thanks_reddit/","title":"Working on my love for reading.
