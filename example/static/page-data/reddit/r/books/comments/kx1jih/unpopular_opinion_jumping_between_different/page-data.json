I don’t have a great memory so I spend a lot of the time trying to remember where they left off. Also, sometimes I don’t like the character or their storyline, but I have to read through it to get to the storyline of the one(s) I do care about, which are normally the ones I chose to read the book for. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve been reading Red Rising, the first three books were phenomenal. The author didn’t jump between characters, it was just the one characters POV and I loved it. Now on the fourth book, 5% in and there’s already three characters to keep up with!
