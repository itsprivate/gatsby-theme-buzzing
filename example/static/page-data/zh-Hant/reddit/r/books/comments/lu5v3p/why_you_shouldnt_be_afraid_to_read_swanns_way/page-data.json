This book is the fattest, juciest heartthrob I&#39;ve ever read.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t be afraid of reading Marcel Proust! He&#39;s only talking about shit we&#39;ve all experienced before! I was intimidated with the purple prose at first but then it suddenly became endearing to me because I realized that what he&#39;s talking about is just mundane shit I&#39;ve experienced day to day. The feverish struggle to go to sleep, yearning for a girl, good brioche, not being able to remember a piece of music, taking a sip of a drink to feel the first hit again etc. The intimacies of daily life! Emotions I have NEVER been able to put words as beautifully as Proust did.</p>\n\n<p>Even though he&#39;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;, I&#39;d argue he already FOUND that lost time, because the eye for beauty he gives you is an appreciation for the life you have. Words in a book to record that lost time. A gratefulness for the most mundane daily shit that EVERYBODY experiences. That the best parts of life is not in the big moments. It&#39;s in these small little places that Proust just perfectly and completely encapsulates. And it&#39;s quite a perfect read during a pandemic for this reason. You should give it a second chance if you&#39;ve turned a page or two and got scared.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve never truly fell in love with a book until like now. I was actually scared to finish this book because I feel like I just don&#39;t want to let go of it. I only hope to inspire other people to read it as well just to be able to experience the expansive breadth of beauty it gives you. I&#39;m fucking devastated actually like what am I going to be doing with myself for the time being I ordered part 2 but it&#39;s not gonna ship until March 9...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lu5v3p/why_you_shouldnt_be_afraid_to_read_swanns_way/","title":"Why you shouldn't be afraid to read Swann's Way","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-28T13:22:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-28 13:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"f40d440e-a816-56ba-a47c-46ab4390e5ab","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lu5v3p/why_you_shouldnt_be_afraid_to_read_swanns_way/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lu5v3p/why_you_shouldnt_be_afraid_to_read_swanns_way/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Zestyclose-Ad8836","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zestyclose-Ad8836","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Zestyclose-Ad8836","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"为什么你不应该害怕读《燕子之道》？","the_new_excerpt":"我的天啊，真是一本美味的书，超越了任何东西。\n我做梦都想得到。这本书是我见过的最胖最多汁的心机小说\n读。\n\n不要害怕读马塞尔-普鲁斯特！他只是在说我们都在说的那些狗屁事。\n以前的经验！我是被紫色吓到了... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼你不應該害怕讀《燕子之道》？","the_new_excerpt":"我的天啊，真是一本美味的書，超越了任何東西。\n我做夢都想得到。這本書是我見過的最胖最多汁的心機小說\n讀。\n\n不要害怕讀馬塞爾-普魯斯特！他只是在說我們都在說的那些狗屁事。\n以前的經驗！我是被紫色嚇到了... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-8524c494-e755-5746-b381-4b2ec1435764","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lu1co4/opinion_how_a_san_francisco_bookstore_owner_made/","title":"Opinion: How a San Francisco bookstore owner made America freer, braver and more interesting","date":"February 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"观点。旧金山书店老板如何让美国更自由、更勇敢、更有趣？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"觀點。舊金山書店老闆如何讓美國更自由、更勇敢、更有趣？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-5fbbcd29-f98d-5b95-bf4f-06a45220496e","excerpt":"Those of you who have been following my little journey...
