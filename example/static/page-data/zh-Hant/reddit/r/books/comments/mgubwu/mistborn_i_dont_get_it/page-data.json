Literally chapter 4 back to back paragraphs repeat with that statement and the writing doesn&#39;t get much better. I will never understand why authors put the &quot;rolled his eyes&quot; line, it&#39;s clichéd. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll give credit where credit is do; the magic system is cool and unique and adds layers of world building I really enjoyed. The plot is simple and straight forward which I also like as certain books (looking at you Dune) get pretty difficult to keep track of who is who and what is what. But characters here just didn&#39;t work for me. Vin is the overly done special peasant girl who is good despite living in the underworld. Maybe I&#39;m wrong in wanting her to be like Arya stark who gets darker as she tries to survive but that&#39;s basically Vin&#39;s upbringing. Anyway I needed to get this off my chest and curious to hear what you have to say.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mgubwu/mistborn_i_dont_get_it/","title":"Mistborn.
