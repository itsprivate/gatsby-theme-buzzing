I decided to start it up again as a freshman in college. It’s only a start but compared to my complete absence of reading last year, I’m happy. This subreddit continues to motivate and offer up new books to explore.</p>\n\n<p>The Iliad</p>\n\n<p>Wanted to read it because I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Odyssey in High School. I felt it fell short in comparison. A great read if you like war and are interested in Homer but I feel it’s themes were too narrow. The battle scenes were long and drawn on and the listing of regiments was particularly odd. Overall a great read but I expected more having loved The Odyssey.</p>\n\n<p>Pride and Prejudice </p>\n\n<p>I decided to read this because I’m a sucker for romance movies and wanted to see if a book had the same effect. The novel exceeded my expectations and delved into interesting themes of classes and sisterhood. Thoroughly enjoyed this one.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you all!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lcc3m6/to_read_more_was_my_new_years_resolution_so_far/","title":"“To read more” was my New Years Resolution.
