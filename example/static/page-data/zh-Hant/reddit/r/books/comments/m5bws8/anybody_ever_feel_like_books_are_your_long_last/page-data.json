When I read a fantasy book in particular I find it like building a relationship. Sometimes I feel lonely or maybe think I am but when I read I feel an immersive about of joy or a sense of belonging with the characters. I suppose that is the point with books but it&#39;s so fun to just keep gaining &quot;friends&quot; or relationships through novels. I was wondering if this is a common occurrence I believe it is. What is your experience with reading regarding loneness or combating a relationship with the characters? Thanks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m5bws8/anybody_ever_feel_like_books_are_your_long_last/","title":"Anybody ever feel like books are your long last friends?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-15T14:22:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-15 14:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"48d0e1a1-9c20-5c26-a9ce-99564e5a51f5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m5bws8/anybody_ever_feel_like_books_are_your_long_last/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m5bws8/anybody_ever_feel_like_books_are_your_long_last/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Straight-Tradition61","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Straight-Tradition61","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Straight-Tradition61","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"有没有人觉得书是你最后的朋友？","the_new_excerpt":"最近我开始喜欢上了阅读，我发现阅读就像认识了\n一个朋友。当我读一本特别的奇幻书时，我发现它就像在建造一个。\n的关系。有时我觉得孤独，或者认为自己很孤独，但当我读到这里时，我觉得\n一种沉浸式的快乐或归属感... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有沒有人覺得書是你最後的朋友？","the_new_excerpt":"最近我開始喜歡上了閱讀，我發現閱讀就像認識了\n一個朋友。當我讀一本特別的奇幻書時，我發現它就像在建造一個。\n的關係。有時我覺得孤獨，或者認爲自己很孤獨，但當我讀到這裏時，我覺得\n一種沉浸式的快樂或歸屬感... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-7a2db599-578a-535c-a8a5-74f2ad9e8564","excerpt":"The Prophet is a poetry collection where a different people in a town asks a\nprophet his opinion on... anything, really.
