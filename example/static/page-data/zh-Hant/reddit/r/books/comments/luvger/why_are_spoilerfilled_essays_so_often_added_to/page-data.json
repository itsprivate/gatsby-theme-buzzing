So why are these added as an &quot;introduction&quot; rather than appended to the end of the text? </p>\n\n<p>These essays don&#39;t always include spoilers, and are often explorations of the author&#39;s life, social norms of the time, translation challenges, and so on, which provide context that would be helpful to know going into the book. However, for me it&#39;s not worth the risk to read them beforehand as publishers give zero notice as to when spoilers may pop up. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, there have been several times when I&#39;ve used the &quot;search&quot; function on my Kindle (needing to remind myself how various characters are related, what happened at a specific plot point, etc.) only to accidentally see the first chronological search results be <em>major spoilers</em> from the introduction explaining part of the plot. </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone understand the reasoning behind this?
