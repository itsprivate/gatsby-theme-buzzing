By the end of the weekend, I had finished it and had to sit twiddling my fingers / rabits ears until next pay day. I kept pestering my Dad to take me along to the library to sign up, but I think he was a bit intimidated (he had hardly any schooling due to the war and the local library was a huge Georgian building with ornate ceilings).</p>\n\n<p>Anyway - after much pestering he caved in. We went in and rather than talk to the woman behind the desk, he just ushered me in her direction! I asked about joining and she quickly had me filling in the necessary paperwork. Eventually she handed me my library card. I could see shelves everywhere, and so said &quot;Um - can you tell me, Um - which shelf is mine?&quot; She smiled as she knealt down next to me and just said &quot;Any of them!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I can remember that feeling and my breath catches even now (50 years later!). All of that for me - and I hadn&#39;t even done anything to deserve it! Thank heaven for local libraries!</p>\n\n<p>So anyway - what do libraries mean to you?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mbrwio/joining_the_library/","title":"Joining the library","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-24T06:52:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-24 06:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"9cc3fd2f-9d7f-5a8c-8504-fcac1ea34dd5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mbrwio/joining_the_library/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mbrwio/joining_the_library/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Ginny-gin-gin","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ginny-gin-gin","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Ginny-gin-gin","score":115,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"加入图书馆","the_new_excerpt":"当我还是个孩子的时候，我每周都会用零花钱买一本书。到了\n周末，我完成了它，并不得不坐着玩弄我的手指。\n兔子的耳朵，直到下一个工资日。我一直缠着爸爸带我一起去。\n图书馆报名，但我觉得他有点被吓到了（他...）。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"加入圖書館","the_new_excerpt":"當我還是個孩子的時候，我每週都會用零花錢買一本書。到了\n週末，我完成了它，並不得不坐着玩弄我的手指。\n兔子的耳朵，直到下一個工資日。我一直纏着爸爸帶我一起去。\n圖書館報名，但我覺得他有點被嚇到了（他...）。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-14f1ff34-e5d0-56c7-adc5-ee5a0f08b56a","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/mbtx66/whats_a_fiction_book_that_provided_you_with/","title":"What’s a fiction book that provided you with invaluable insight and/or life lessons that no self-help book could?","date":"March 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"有什么小说书给你提供了宝贵的见解和/或生活经验，是任何自助书都无法做到的？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"有什麼小說書給你提供了寶貴的見解和/或生活經驗，是任何自助書都無法做到的？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-d7dc6408-6cfc-5fdd-b1ae-24dee80d8879","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mc61ou/dolly_partons_imagination_library_distributes/","title":"Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library distributes over 200,000 books to Flint kids","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 24, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"多莉-帕顿的想象力图书馆向弗林特的孩子们发放了20多万册图书。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"多莉-帕頓的想象力圖書館向弗林特的孩子們發放了20多萬冊圖書。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-9cc3fd2f-9d7f-5a8c-8504-fcac1ea34dd5","previousId":"RedditPost-14f1ff34-e5d0-56c7-adc5-ee5a0f08b56a","nextId":"RedditPost-d7dc6408-6cfc-5fdd-b1ae-24dee80d8879","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://changemyview.buzzing.cc","author":"Buzzing.cc","locale":"zh","title":"你可以改变我的想法吗？","iconUrl":"https://i.imgur.com/jVsw5Oq.png","defaultSocialImageUrl":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1624129591276-5b11185e7b42?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2739&q=80","shortTitle":"改变我的想法","description":"用中文浏览Reddit-Change My View的热帖","keywords":["buzzing","改变我的想法","reddit"],"telegram":"@buzzingcc","telegram_chat_id":"-1001406368978","menuLinks":[{"name":"每周精选","url":"/issues"}],"subscriptions":[{"name":"Twitter @buzzingcc","url":"https://twitter.com/buzzingcc","external":true},{"name":"Telegram @buzzingcc","url":"https://t.me/buzzingcc","external":true},{"name":"RSS","url":"/rss.xml","prefetch":false}],"social":[{"name":"Change My View","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/","external":true}],"localize":[{"locale":"en","title":"Buzzing on Change My View","shortTitle":"BuzzCMV","description":"See what's buzzing on Reddit Change My View Subreddit in your native language","keywords":["buzzing","Change My View","Change My Mind"],"menuLinks":[{"name":"Weekly Selection","url":"/en/issues"}],"social":[{"name":"Change My View","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/en/","external":true}]},{"locale":"zh-Hant","title":"你可以改變我的想法嗎？","shortTitle":"改變我的想法","description":"用中文瀏覽Reddit-Change My View的熱帖","keywords":["buzzing","改變我的想法","reddit"],"menuLinks":[{"name":"每週精選","url":"/zh-Hant/issues"}],"social":[{"name":"Change My View","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/zh-Hant/","external":true}]},{"locale":"ja","title":"気が変わってもらえますか？","shortTitle":"気が変わってもらえますか","description":"人気のReddit気が変わってもらえますか記事を日本語で閲覧","keywords":["buzzing","気が変わってもらえますか？"],"menuLinks":[]}]},"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mbrwio/joining_the_library/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
