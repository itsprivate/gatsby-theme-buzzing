People have been telling me for years that I needed to read it. My obstinate self didn’t listen. As a woman, at the time I was obsessed with female authors like Anne McCaffrey and hated the way male authors described female characters. \nI’m so glad I finally gave in and gave them a chance. And while Robert Jordan does mention “bosoms” quite often, he makes up for it in his detailed description of the men (most importantly Mat’s behind).\nThe story was wonderfully rich and full of well written characters that made you laugh and cry and cheer all the way to the end.
