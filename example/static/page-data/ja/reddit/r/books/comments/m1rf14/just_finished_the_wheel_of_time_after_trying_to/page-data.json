I really can&#39;t come up with a reason (or just don&#39;t remember) why I stopped but I picked it back up about 6 months ago and just today finished A Memory of Light. These books are wonderful, I absolutely devoured all 15 books in that amount of time and can say I highly encourage anyone that put them down like I did to give it another shot. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve always loved Tolkien and besides The Stormlight Archive (and I don&#39;t count Stormlight because it&#39;s not finished yet) I haven&#39;t had an experience that I&#39;ve actually felt I liked more than his works until now. I will have to give Wheel of Time a re-read before I can actually give any kind of answer but there were so many times where I thought to myself that this is the best story I&#39;ve ever experienced. </p>\n\n<p>Tldr: This series is wonderful and if you&#39;ve put it down I&#39;d say it&#39;s definitely worth picking back up and trying again.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m1rf14/just_finished_the_wheel_of_time_after_trying_to/","title":"Just finished The Wheel Of Time after trying to read The Eye of the World 3 different times","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-10T15:26:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-10 15:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e627a87c-1037-5d80-91c3-89fbd7dc03a2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m1rf14/just_finished_the_wheel_of_time_after_trying_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m1rf14/just_finished_the_wheel_of_time_after_trying_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"KaseBee","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/KaseBee","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"KaseBee","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"在试着读了3遍《世界之眼》后，刚刚读完《时空之轮》。","the_new_excerpt":"所以大约2年前，我第一次开始《世界之眼》，把\n扔了一半之后，我又尝试着把它完成2\n次。我实在想不出一个理由（或者说就是不记得了），为什么我。\n停止，但我拿起它回 约6个月前，只是今天... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在試着讀了3遍《世界之眼》後，剛剛讀完《時空之輪》。","the_new_excerpt":"所以大約2年前，我第一次開始《世界之眼》，把\n扔了一半之後，我又嘗試着把它完成2\n次。我實在想不出一個理由（或者說就是不記得了），爲什麼我。\n停止，但我拿起它回 約6個月前，只是今天... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-0fa7543c-17a0-56f2-bf0d-f118c7e08577","excerpt":"Disclaimer: I posted this a few weeks ago but it got removed because I added a\nword that rhymes with SCHMOILER\n\nI’m not trying to karma whore.
