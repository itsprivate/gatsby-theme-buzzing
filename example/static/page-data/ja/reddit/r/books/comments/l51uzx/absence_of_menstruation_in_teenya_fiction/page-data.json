At the time, I put it down to menstruation being an &quot;inappropriate&quot; subject that simply couldn&#39;t be discussed in books aimed at young people. </p>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;m starting to see the role that this plays in maintaining menstruation as a taboo subject. In movies and TV it&#39;s kind of excusable as stories are a lot more action-focused - you aren&#39;t shown so many mundane details of character&#39;s lives. In books however, where&#39;s your inside characters&#39; heads all the time and know what they ate for breakfast and what their bedroom smells like, a hush-hush on menstruation becomes an elephant in the room. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not expecting teen novels to have deep introspection about what it means to be a woman, just the mundane acknowledgement that female characters menstruate. If she&#39;s roughing it in the woods for the night, she might need to improvise pads. If a 12-year-old girl is packing supplies for a long adventure, &quot;what if I start my period&quot; would almost definitely cross her mind. I feel like it&#39;s not really proper representation if something so integral is just...left out. </p>\n\n<p>Does this bother you? Have you come across any Teen/YA books which handle it well?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l51uzx/absence_of_menstruation_in_teenya_fiction/","title":"Absence of menstruation in Teen/YA fiction","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T22:08:01.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 22:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e1c0d997-7326-5193-ba36-97c7e365174f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l51uzx/absence_of_menstruation_in_teenya_fiction/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l51uzx/absence_of_menstruation_in_teenya_fiction/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"mistress-eve","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mistress-eve","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"mistress-eve","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"少年/青年小说中没有月经的现象","the_new_excerpt":"这个问题困扰了我多年，但我从来没有想过要真正讨论这个问题，直到\n现在。\n\n小时候，我肯定会注意到，我最喜欢的女主\n的书籍似乎从来没有月经（甚至提到/想到它），尽管是。\n的年龄，它几乎肯定会在你的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"少年/青年小說中沒有月經的現象","the_new_excerpt":"這個問題困擾了我多年，但我從來沒有想過要真正討論這個問題，直到\n現在。\n\n小時候，我肯定會注意到，我最喜歡的女主\n的書籍似乎從來沒有月經（甚至提到/想到它），儘管是。\n的年齡，它幾乎肯定會在你的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-f14d5941-c325-5341-88dd-57a3e731110d","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l5gubd/book_sales_defy_pandemic_to_hit_eightyear_high/","title":"Book sales defy pandemic to hit eight-year high - Despite shops being closed for much of 2020, figures show Britons bought books in volume – although many authors continued to struggle","date":"January 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"图书销售不顾流行病，创下8年新高--尽管2020年大部分时间商店都关闭了，但数据显示英国人买书的数量--尽管许多作者继续在挣扎","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"圖書銷售不顧流行病，創下8年新高--儘管2020年大部分時間商店都關閉了，但數據顯示英國人買書的數量--儘管許多作者繼續在掙扎","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-7bf86495-6bed-5040-983a-ecbf751acdcd","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l5nskv/i_did_it_i_finally_did_it_i_finished_a_book_for/","title":"I did it, I finally did it!
