Turns out the romance is basically a side plot and I&#39;ve been dragging myself to read through it so I can get to the romance part (if there even is). This doesn&#39;t mean the book&#39;s boring or the story&#39;s bad - it&#39;s actually pretty good and I&#39;ll probably enjoy it more if I wasn&#39;t in the mood for something more romance-centered.</p>\n\n<p>Ever read a book which made you feel like this?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Read a lot of comments giving advice and I&#39;d just like to say thanks for making me lose guilt over not finishing a book (and y&#39;all did that in just an hour!). I see some people have had to figure this out on their own. I&#39;m lucky to have been assured immediately on my first time experiencing this!</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: I DNF-ED IT WOOO AND ALL MY GUILT AND HESITATIONS ARE GONE THANKS TO Y&#39;ALL WOOHOO All of us who struggle with the same problem would like to thank y&#39;all so much!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Jwu and this blew up! Thanks for the awards! I&#39;ll try to read through all the comments sometime and hopefully this post and the comments helped a lot of people!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/kuendn/do_you_ever_start_reading_a_book_but_dont_get/","title":"Do you ever start reading a book but don't get hooked so you want to read a different one but can't because you haven't finished the current one so you have to drag yourself to finish it because you just can't bear to DNF a book?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T03:12:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 03:12","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ea9e1252-4973-5a1c-aac0-28b1ac984d19","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kuendn/do_you_ever_start_reading_a_book_but_dont_get/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kuendn/do_you_ever_start_reading_a_book_but_dont_get/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"queenarmilo","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/queenarmilo","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"queenarmilo","score":12611,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你是否有这样的经历：开始看一本书，但没有被吸引，所以想看另一本书，但又不能看，因为你还没有看完现在的书，所以你不得不拖着自己看完，因为你实在不忍心DNF一本书。","the_new_excerpt":"我以《我们之间的阴影》和《我们之间的阴影》开始了这一年的奇幻爱情高潮。\n在看了r/suggestmeabook[/r/suggestmeabook]的建议后，我\n继而又推出了《Uprooted》。原来爱情基本都是旁枝末节，而\n我一直在拖着自己读完它，这样我就可以得到... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你是否有這樣的經歷：開始看一本書，但沒有被吸引，所以想看另一本書，但又不能看，因爲你還沒有看完現在的書，所以你不得不拖着自己看完，因爲你實在不忍心DNF一本書。","the_new_excerpt":"我以《我們之間的陰影》和《我們之間的陰影》開始了這一年的奇幻愛情高潮。\n在看了r/suggestmeabook[/r/suggestmeabook]的建議後，我\n繼而又推出了《Uprooted》。原來愛情基本都是旁枝末節，而\n我一直在拖着自己讀完它，這樣我就可以得到... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-384970b3-ce5f-5578-965e-fba9566cb052","excerpt":"I think that in my case it depends on the quality of the rest of the story.
