They want to intrigue you and make the plot look appealing and therefore they systematically reveal little twists (or unforeseen development) that I would have rather experienced reading the book. It&#39;s very comparable to movie trailers that spoil you big chunks of the movie by wanting to grab your attention.</p>\n\n<p>I won&#39;t beat around the bush, my main point is back covers spoil a book. I have been spoiled by back covers. I think most notably about &quot;An education&quot; (I had no idea what that little girl would grow up to be) and &quot;11/22/63&quot; (although it doesn&#39;t spoil anything major, it pitches stuff happening as far as page 400). And those are just the very recent ones that I accidentally glanced at.</p>\n\n<p>By diving into a book not even knowing the time period it takes place in or the overall direction of the plot, I can experience suspense and curiosity right from the beginning. I don&#39;t have to catch up with the first hundred pages thinking &quot;Well, I know what he&#39;ll be deciding, the back cover filled me in&quot;. Right from the beginning, I piece together what it is going to be about and I have never needed a back cover.</p>\n\n<p>I know many of you read back covers though, because you need them. Some of you probably wonder right now how I choose my books without looking at the pitch of the story. Well, based on a recommendation system : from Reddit, or friends or the Amazon/Goodreads rating. It&#39;s not a perfect system but it is a much less revealing one. It has rarely failed me to be honest. Or at least, when a recommendation hasn&#39;t worked for me, the back cover reading wouldn&#39;t have prevented it anyway. The back cover can pitch you a premisse and never live up to it. It&#39;s not a token of guarantee. For example, I saw this sub has voted 11/22/63 as the &quot;best mystery thriller book of the 2010&#39;s decade&quot;. I didn&#39;t need to read the back cover to know I ought to give it a try. The only time I&#39;d consent to read a back cover is if I&#39;m losing interest for a book, to check if there&#39;s any future event foreshadowed that I could be looking forward to and that would spark my curiosity back.</p>\n\n<p>I was wondering if other readers were also making the choice of not reading back covers or is this an unpopular opinion ?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ltj9w0/i_stopped_reading_back_covers_and_it_has_improved/","title":"I stopped reading back covers and it has improved my reading experience","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-27T13:58:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-27 13:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"049cfc4e-7670-58d0-8dd0-152733db48e6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ltj9w0/i_stopped_reading_back_covers_and_it_has_improved/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ltj9w0/i_stopped_reading_back_covers_and_it_has_improved/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"ImOwningThisUsername","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ImOwningThisUsername","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ImOwningThisUsername","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我不再看封底了，它改善了我的阅读体验。","the_new_excerpt":"我已经好几个月没看封底了。为什么我不看呢？它们\n想要引起你的兴趣，使情节看起来很吸引人，因此他们\n系统性地揭示了一些小的转折（或不可预见的发展），我将\n有相当多的经验读这本书。很能和电影相提并论...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我不再看封底了，它改善了我的閱讀體驗。","the_new_excerpt":"我已經好幾個月沒看封底了。爲什麼我不看呢？它們\n想要引起你的興趣，使情節看起來很吸引人，因此他們\n系統性地揭示了一些小的轉折（或不可預見的發展），我將\n有相當多的經驗讀這本書。很能和電影相提並論...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-917134e8-81f7-5b06-8ba5-3116bc5de6be","excerpt":"To give a bit more detail I picked up reading after literal years and started\nwith Kafka on the Shore based on how many people loved it and my general\ncuriosity for the supposed metaphysics elements and the author.
