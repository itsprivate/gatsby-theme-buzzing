She&#39;s been working hard on zoom for the past year (unable to retire due to finances) and I really wish she could catch a break!</p>\n\n<p>One thing that&#39;s been getting her through all this is Diana Gabaldon&#39;s Outlander series on Audiobook, as expertly narrated by Davina Porter, but she&#39;s listened to it twice now and is looking for something new !</p>\n\n<p>She says the Outlander series is a good mix of historical tidbits and intrigue, but also something you can semi tune out of here and there (not too dense or requiring a huge amount of focus). Honestly, to hear her tell it, it&#39;s been one of the very few things that has brought her real comfort during the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>I think her admiration for Davina Porter is on the same level of her appreciation for the author&#39;s writing! She even said she listened to some biography of Elizabeth I that Porter narrated, just to give you an idea.</p>\n\n<p>She&#39;s also indicated a (variable) fondness for Isabel Allende; she liked House of Spirits and Island Beneath The Sea, but expressed an indifference towards some of her other works (which I wish I could remember, gah. I think she said A Long Petal Of The Sea didn&#39;t really grab her ?)</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m basically looking for audiobook recommendations of similar works (or works read by Davina Porter), hopefully available thru libby.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks so much all ;_;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/mfig7m/help_for_a_lovely_old_ladyoutlander_fan/","title":"Help for a lovely old lady?(Outlander fan)","tags":["booksuggestions","reddit"],"date":"March 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-29T12:21:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-29 12:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"173cec78-4546-5be2-a974-2105047ab4b9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/mfig7m/help_for_a_lovely_old_ladyoutlander_fan/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/mfig7m/help_for_a_lovely_old_ladyoutlander_fan/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"booksuggestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions","author":"ghoststory","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ghoststory","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ghoststory","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"帮帮一个可爱的老太太吧？","the_new_excerpt":"我有一个70多岁的朋友，她因为...\ncovid相关的关注。在过去的一年里，她一直在努力研究zoom\n(由于经济原因无法退休)，我真的希望她能抓紧时间休息!\n\n有一件事让她度过了这一切，那就是戴安娜... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"幫幫一個可愛的老太太吧？","the_new_excerpt":"我有一個70多歲的朋友，她因爲...\ncovid相關的關注。在過去的一年裏，她一直在努力研究zoom\n(由於經濟原因無法退休)，我真的希望她能抓緊時間休息!\n\n有一件事讓她度過了這一切，那就是戴安娜... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ea9838b2-ffe8-5b45-b906-59ad46227a7b","excerpt":"I noticed this sub only really revolves around fiction, probably because it's\nwidely accessible and relevant for everyone.\n\nI myself mostly read non-fiction though and I think you can kind of see inside\nsomeone's deeper interests by seeing what type of non-fiction they read.\n\nFor instance, I'm…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mf8k41/what_books_have_you_read_or_are_reading_that_are/","title":"What books have you read or are reading that are related to your niche interests or hobbies?","date":"March 29, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你读过或正在读哪些与你的小众兴趣或爱好相关的书籍？","the_new_excerpt":"我注意到这个子只真正围绕着小说，可能是因为它是\n广为流传，与大家息息相关。\n\n不过我自己主要是看非虚构类的小说，我觉得你可以算是看到了里面的内容。\n一个人的更深层次的兴趣，通过看他们读什么类型的非小说。\n\n例如，我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你讀過或正在讀哪些與你的小衆興趣或愛好相關的書籍？","the_new_excerpt":"我注意到這個子只真正圍繞着小說，可能是因爲它是\n廣爲流傳，與大家息息相關。\n\n不過我自己主要是看非虛構類的小說，我覺得你可以算是看到了裏面的內容。\n一個人的更深層次的興趣，通過看他們讀什麼類型的非小說。\n\n例如，我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-467b4995-3aa5-5223-bd45-42a041503258","excerpt":"I've been having a lot of trouble with this because no matter how hard I try, I\ncan't picture the characters talking like...that.
