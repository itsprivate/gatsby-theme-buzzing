But, I came across this sub Reddit and I thought to myself, give it a try, it might be helpful. </p>\n\n<p>So here goes nothing.</p>\n\n<p>When I was little, I grew up reading books. My parents read to me before bedtime and eventually, when I could, I read stories before sleeping myself. And in high school, we had to have a book with us every day. They didn&#39;t want us to daydream and do nothing in between classes, if you were finished with your assignments you were supposed to read your book.  </p>\n\n<p>To top it off, we had to report how far along we were! If you had a new book because you finished your old one, that had to be reported as well. So naturally, I was trying to be the fastest reader in the class. So I managed to read whole books in one month. My parents were proud, teachers were proud and I was proud of myself too! I was so amazed by how my imagination worked when reading those books. I imagined being a character too. Those were really fun times.</p>\n\n<p>But then in junior year, I lost interest, and all of a sudden a lot of classmates were talking about this new app and how fun it was. They all encouraged me to join them. Some of them said that I shouldn&#39;t be such a bookworm. That&#39;s when I kind of didn&#39;t want to read anymore. I was afraid that they would bully me. After school everyone was online and chatting and playing games with each other, I didn&#39;t want to be the odd duck. At that time I refused to touch another book again. </p>\n\n<p>However, a few years later I found Wattpad! So that piqued my interest and I started reading again. Of course, it’s not the same as reading a real book. But I was happy that I was reading again. It had is down side though, because I was so used to reading from a small screen I got too lazy to read an actual book. And that’s such a shame honestly. I know that there is no better feeling than feeling the paper on your fingertips. Alas, even Wattpad wasn’t that interesting to me anymore, so I hardly read anything on there anymore. </p>\n\n<p>I am dying to find a good book to read again. I really want to pick up my old hobby again and I want to get lost in the story and let my imagination go wild. </p>\n\n<p>To summarise, I used to love reading and I read a lot. I basically devoured books. But then fear took over and I was afraid I was going to get bullied for being a “bookworm” and that’s when I stopped reading. So can somebody help a sis out and recommend me an easy book to begin with?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/l0gita/used_to_be_a_book_lover_but_then_social_media/","title":"Used to be a book lover, but then social media happened and I lost interest.
