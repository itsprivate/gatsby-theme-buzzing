Most recent discussion is the Harry &amp; Meghan interview, and I find it very difficult to argue my point without getting heated because I can’t believe my Dad’s side of it. I find this then cheapens my argument and I can’t think as clearly. I’m just finding it a bit harder lately, not sure why. </p>\n\n<p>I want to learn how to keep my cool and be understanding and respectful of the opposite opinion even if I disagree with it strongly. I know my dad cherishes these ‘arguments’ as we usually get a good debate going, and it is quality time we have together. I want to make sure they are respectful and productive. Are there any books to help with this?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks everyone!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/m0vl5g/a_book_to_help_me_be_less_emotional_in/","title":"A book to help me be less emotional in debates/arguments/heated discussions","tags":["booksuggestions","reddit"],"date":"March 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-09T04:54:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-09 04:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"4ad23474-3010-58ff-876e-d7cc576db323","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/m0vl5g/a_book_to_help_me_be_less_emotional_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/m0vl5g/a_book_to_help_me_be_less_emotional_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"booksuggestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions","author":"Donberry_Do","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Donberry_Do","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Donberry_Do","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"一本书可以帮助我在辩论/争论/激烈的讨论中减少情绪化。","the_new_excerpt":"我喜欢和我爸聊政治，聊时事，当我们聊到\n每周都会进行FaceTime，但我们的观点完全不同。最近的讨论\n是哈里和梅根的采访，我发现它很难 争论我的观点。\n而不被激怒，因为我不相信我爸那边的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一本書可以幫助我在辯論/爭論/激烈的討論中減少情緒化。","the_new_excerpt":"我喜歡和我爸聊政治，聊時事，當我們聊到\n每週都會進行FaceTime，但我們的觀點完全不同。最近的討論\n是哈里和梅根的採訪，我發現它很難 爭論我的觀點。\n而不被激怒，因爲我不相信我爸那邊的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-5b0f4fd0-e74f-50ac-ac72-0ce79d676ded","excerpt":"I've been trying to find a self-help book in the last few years that would\nchange the way I think and act in life.
