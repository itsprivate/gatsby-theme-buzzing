So does anyone know of a good romance novel where we get to see the story through the eyes of a male protagonist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want it to be a nice, well written romance where the couple has chemistry and their interactions feel enjoyable to read, like Pride and Prejudice for example. I also want the characters to be more realistic and grounded if possible, and not feel like a fantasy, so preferably no super hot billionare businessman male leads Christian Gray style or sexy supermodel female lead, and the story centers around more normal people.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, I&amp;#39;m listening to the series as audiobooks, primarily narrated by Nigel Planar. If you&amp;#39;ve never read or listened through this series, what in heaven&amp;#39;s name are you waiting for? Certainly, if you credit yourself as any kind of literary mind--no matter how deep or shallow--you&amp;#39;ll find not only a relatable cast of characters to enjoy, but equally a breadth of satire I didn&amp;#39;t fully appreciate as a young man, and now entering middle age, I find to be quite appealing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel I was misled when I first picked up the series. I had been told by multiple sources that a) you don&amp;#39;t need to read them in order--which is true, but also b) that the first few books aren&amp;#39;t very good and not a good introduction to the series. Though I agree that the first three books may not be the strongest--with book three, &lt;em&gt;Equal Rites,&lt;/em&gt; easily being the weakest of the bunch next to &lt;em&gt;Maurice and His Amazing Rats&lt;/em&gt;--reading the series chronologically vs. thematically is definitely the way to go, in my opinion. Taken chronologically, not only is the series more solid and the worldbuilding better appreciated, but you get to invest time and energy in worthy shares between the thematic characters: Death, The Watch, The Witches, The Wizards, etc. You&amp;#39;re also better informed on the running jokes that flow between the books, but don&amp;#39;t necessarily follow only one cast of characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, the series reminds me of Shakespeare. There are clowns and lovers and princes and tyrants, witches and wizards and tyrants and soldiers all playing out their roles on the platform of the Disc. (Incidentally, if you like Shakespeare, &lt;em&gt;Wyrd Sisters&lt;/em&gt; is a marvelous send-up on Macbeth) Entrances and exits are applauded, tears are shed, laughter abounds, and the end of each book (if not the series as a whole with the untimely death of Sir Terry), you&amp;#39;re left pondering the deeper questions of life. And that, I think, is the true weakness--the end. With Sir Terry&amp;#39;s death only a few short years ago, the series doesn&amp;#39;t have a proper ending--in my opinion. &lt;em&gt;Raising Steam&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent book, but I don&amp;#39;t feel you get a proper curtain on the books as a whole. If, as it is so often interpreted, Prospero&amp;#39;s last speech in &lt;em&gt;The Tempest&lt;/em&gt; is Shakespeare&amp;#39;s farewell to the stage and audience, then the readers of the disc are left asking: what comes next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts? Have you read it? What&amp;#39;s your favorite book or your favorite set of characters?&lt;/p&gt;

Cummings, T.S. Eliot, William Butler Yeats, Langston Hughes and more. The recordings include a mix of excerpts of novels and poetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I discovered some albums of 20th century writers reciting their work and eventually I came across these albums. I recently realized that there were a huge volume of these Soundmark recordings, but there doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be anywhere to find them all in one place, so I searched for as many as I could find and compiled them into this playlist. (I&amp;#39;m not sure how many I may be missing, so if you know of any albums I should add, feel free to comment them here or send me a message and I&amp;#39;ll add it!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been really enjoying listening to these writers reading their own words, and I find it&amp;#39;s interesting to hear their different accents and inflections and how lyrically or flatly they individually speak. It&amp;#39;s like discovering another dimension to the written work, since you&amp;#39;re not only experiencing the words of the author but you&amp;#39;re actually hearing the words spoken in their own voice with all their own unique inflections and articulations. I would be interested to know what all your thoughts are on this, and whether you think it adds or takes away from the experience of these texts.&lt;/p&gt;

First, it&amp;#39;s an exciting cops-and-fugitives thriller. Second, it&amp;#39;s an interesting dystopia of earth in decline and people in despair after nuclear war. Third, it has the philosophical or psychological mindfuck elements that I was told Philip K Dick had. I read the whole thing in two days because it was so engaging, and it was one of the sadder books I have read, though not as sad as Earth Abides was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously empathy, and the lack thereof was a pretty major theme of the book. The androids are distinguished from humans by their lack of genuine empathy (but just barely), yet the bounty hunters who go after them seem even less empathic sometimes. There is an entire religion of empathy, which is what some of my questions are about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second theme I noticed is how much of a difference there is between &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;not real&amp;quot;. The humans and androids are barely distinguishable from one another, and sometimes the androids are actually easier to sympathize with rather than the humans. The religion of mercerism is proven &amp;quot;fake&amp;quot; yet it still gives supernatural visions to people (mere hallucinations don&amp;#39;t give tactical positions, telling you who is coming up behind you). At the end, Iran (the woman not the country) decides that the fake elctronic frog is important to Deckard even if it&amp;#39;s not a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; frog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a little confused as what to make of Mercerism by the end of the book. On one hand, it&amp;#39;s briefly compared to Hitler when Buster Friendly is publically debunking it, probably because of how androids can&amp;#39;t be join in the shared feelings of empathy that the religion is based on. On the other hand, it also seems to embody just how important empathy is to human life. So what am I to make of mercerism - is it kindly empathy or psuedo-Nazism? I also do not understand why Mercer is telling Deckard that it is wrong to kill the androids yet he must do it anyways. Is Mercer pro or anti-android?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also not sure what to make of the androids themselves. Luba Luft was probably the most &amp;quot;human&amp;quot; of the androids, maybe moreso than the human who shot her. On the other hand, the androids who John Isidore (a pretty sad character) was trying to help were pretty morally repulsive by repaying his attempts to help by torturing to death a spider that he tried to rescue. I had mixed feelings about them - they seemed to be in genuine suffering over being hunted and their generally crappy lot in life, yet they demonstrated several times just how selfish and uncaring androids are, living up to the stereotypes of androids all too well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; view towards Mercerism and the androids? If I understood those two elements a little better I think the whole story would fall into place for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book I got also had Man in the High Castle, Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, and Ubik. I might read Ubik next. Or a Dunsany novel. Or some medieval poetry. I change my mind a lot about whatever I read next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I forgot to say this earlier. The theme of empathy also reminded me of how empathy has been measurably declining in society for some time now. There is some research about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/sunday/the-sunday-edition-for-june-9-2019-1.5165327/empathy-makes-us-human-but-research-suggests-it-may-be-on-the-decline-1.5166354&quot;&gt;decline&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wordonthestreets.net/Articles/549246/The_decline_of.aspx&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; empathy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apa.org/research/action/speaking-of-psychology/empathy-narcissism&quot;&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt;.

I will never understand why authors put the &amp;quot;rolled his eyes&amp;quot; line, it&amp;#39;s clichéd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll give credit where credit is do; the magic system is cool and unique and adds layers of world building I really enjoyed. The plot is simple and straight forward which I also like as certain books (looking at you Dune) get pretty difficult to keep track of who is who and what is what. But characters here just didn&amp;#39;t work for me. Vin is the overly done special peasant girl who is good despite living in the underworld. Maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong in wanting her to be like Arya stark who gets darker as she tries to survive but that&amp;#39;s basically Vin&amp;#39;s upbringing.

So essentially, half of the book was amazing and the other half I rolled my eyes at the 15 sex scenes throughout. I mean, I don’t mind sex in books but it was a little much and not very well written in my opinion. But the ENDING made me mad. Holding hands and singing the freaking Wizard of Oz... are you kidding me dude. I don’t know, it felt so cheesy to me and I felt like I wasted my time. &lt;/p&gt;

We used to play down there all the time so naturally I ended up looking through most of them. In one was this huge thousand page book with the old cover for the complete and uncut editon (The coolest cover btw). Around this time I had fallen in love with reading and wanted to get my hands on everything. When my I asked my dad if I could read it all he said, &amp;quot;No, its way to scary.&amp;quot; For years I always wondered what was so spooky about it. Eveyone I asked said the same thing and even when I got older I was still never allowed to read it. That is untill I got really bored and decided to read it stuck in my appartment during quarintine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It really is that spooky -&lt;/strong&gt; Books have never scared me, but this one did. Usualy when you think of being scared you think of a jump scare of something like that, this was completely different. It is more like a long spiraling decent of a jump scare. When I was finished reading it I was unsettled for like 2 days. I have never been left with that sort of feeling durring and especially after finishing a book. What makes it worse is the cotent of the book and what is going on today. I could not have picked a better book to read durring this time and I am super glad I did. So for anyone who likes 1000 page books that are deeply disturbing and biblical and have all this really cool stuff, this one is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

My fellow Redditors, I was not prepared for the feelings this novel engendered in me. It just radiated warmth, charm and whimsy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story-wise this is defintely a unique one. It follows a man who has a job that entails writing reports on orphanages that house magical children. One day he is given a task of going off to an orphanage where the &amp;quot;dangerous&amp;quot; magical children stay...
The book sparks discussions about whether we should condemn groups of people based on their exterior or look deeper and if objectivity is really the best way of going about matters that have to do with people&amp;#39;s livelihood. It shows the negligence of bureaucratic control  and the corrupt nature of people fearing what they cannot understand. There are parallels that could be made between some situations in this book and our world which adds to just how much of a good layered story this book is. The writing is brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characters are all fantastic (well not all but the main characters). Linus Baker you poor bastard, how many times did you have to suffer an almost heart attack at the sight of Anti-Ch-, sorry, &lt;em&gt;Lucy&lt;/em&gt;? But in all seriousness I loved reading from his pov. His self-deprecating disposition and his desire to flee certain situations but finding himself unable to made me cackle alot. This book is flipping funny yall! Its crazy the amount of times I burst out laughing! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talia is my favourite character out of all the kids. I love every single one of them though. They are all unique, loveable, charming and absolutely brave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall this is a story I will be revisting in the future and one that is sure to stay with me.&lt;/p&gt;

I loved it, and have read it a few times since. I’ve always had a great appreciation for Fitzgerald’s skill at conveying a national mood in a story, but my recent re-reading was a totally new experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parallels between the 1920s and 2020s are a cliche at this point, and it’s only 2021, but I do think this last year gives a new kind of reading to the book where you feel the atmosphere so readily it’s almost dizzying. I did some academic reading recently about the cultural amnesia of the 1918 influenza pandemic, because (along with WW1 of course) it was this staggering global trauma, but it undoubtedly contributed to the glorious, dangerous hedonism explored in Gatsby. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the traumatised hedonism and rampant socio-economic inequality that, imo, form the axes of the Great Gatsby, I honestly think the collective experience of the last year(s) lends a whole new dimension to reading this classic.&lt;/p&gt;

It has a 4.26 rating out of nearly 62,000 ratings. I was excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His narration was charming and fun to listen to, however when he started casually mentioning the domestic violence that goes on between his parents (both ways), I thought ok, he&amp;#39;s probably going to be exploring his childhood trauma or something, but no, he says &amp;quot;some may call this xxx but we called it love.&amp;quot; I write xxx because I can&amp;#39;t recall the specific word he used, similar vein to DV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was his parents throwing and breaking plates at other, shouting and swearing. Fighting to the point of talking about divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then pretty early in the book, he says he stole someone else&amp;#39;s poem for a writing contest(or a piece of homework that won something), he said his mum&amp;#39;s idea was if you don&amp;#39;t get caught it&amp;#39;s not stealing. He was laughing while narrating and it sounded like a fond memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was his first meeting with his wife, can&amp;#39;t recall the details but I remember cringing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t really find any reviews talking about these things, some negative ones criticize him being a narcissist, but most find him and his behaviour charming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I also just remembered how he had to beat the shit out of someone who badmouthed his dad for his dad to finally recognise him(Mathew) as a &amp;#39;good son&amp;#39; &amp;#39;real man&amp;#39;....&lt;/p&gt;

Take this quote from Helen Burns in Jane Eyre:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. We are, and must be, one and all, burdened by faults in this world; but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies...I hold another creed, which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention, but in which I delight, and to which I cling; for it extends hope to all; it makes Eternity a rest—a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helen Burns is fourteen. FOURTEEN. Try to picture a 14 year old saying that. It just doesn&amp;#39;t work. But take Tom Sawyer. It was published just about 29 years later, but with the exception of a bit of outdated slang, the characters could easily be from the present. And I read somewhere that Tom Sayer was one of the first popular books to use &amp;quot;vernacular speech&amp;quot;. Does that mean that Jane Eyre used speech that was formalized in writing? Or did everyone speak formally? Help me out.&lt;/p&gt;

She&amp;#39;s been working hard on zoom for the past year (unable to retire due to finances) and I really wish she could catch a break!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that&amp;#39;s been getting her through all this is Diana Gabaldon&amp;#39;s Outlander series on Audiobook, as expertly narrated by Davina Porter, but she&amp;#39;s listened to it twice now and is looking for something new !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says the Outlander series is a good mix of historical tidbits and intrigue, but also something you can semi tune out of here and there (not too dense or requiring a huge amount of focus). Honestly, to hear her tell it, it&amp;#39;s been one of the very few things that has brought her real comfort during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think her admiration for Davina Porter is on the same level of her appreciation for the author&amp;#39;s writing! She even said she listened to some biography of Elizabeth I that Porter narrated, just to give you an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s also indicated a (variable) fondness for Isabel Allende; she liked House of Spirits and Island Beneath The Sea, but expressed an indifference towards some of her other works (which I wish I could remember, gah. I think she said A Long Petal Of The Sea didn&amp;#39;t really grab her ?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m basically looking for audiobook recommendations of similar works (or works read by Davina Porter), hopefully available thru libby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other book I&amp;#39;m reading is &amp;quot;Red Revolution, Green Revolution&amp;quot; about the early efforts in communist China to revolutionize and modernize the agriculture of the nation through a mixture of traditional knowledge and modern scientific techniques and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

More than the ghost part, I am bowled over by how well he deals with the feelings surrounding death. &lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;The grief of the parents and the constant premonition of &amp;#39;sometimes dead IS better&amp;#39; was so well done! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I read Salem&amp;#39;s Lot and now reading  IT. I have watched the movie, but the book is so much more. &lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;The part where Bill is struggling with his brothers&amp;#39; death and describes the cold space between his parents just hits hard. A 10-year-old grieving for his 6-year-old dead brother becomes such an intimate scene for the reader! &lt;/span&gt; He is my favorite horror author now. He may not have the best prose or a beautiful flowery writing style, but his direct and intimate writing style works for horror very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to say to this group that thank you for suggesting Pet Semetary. If there are any older readers hesitating to start reading King, my advice is that there&amp;#39;s a lot to love in his books even if you are grown up now.&lt;/p&gt;

I often try to note down passages I like, turns in the plot, characters, but these get forgotten within a short space of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I looked over a few novels that I read about five years ago and could not remember much about the plot other than a few key features. All the intricacy that drew me to the novel? Vague notions recalled, but very little details have stayed in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to reread some of these books to recover what I lost, but I also think that life is short and there is so much out there to enjoy, why read things more than once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often see posts like &amp;quot;I finally started reading again after fifteen years. I used to read a lot but then at high school I was forced to read and overanalyze books and poems and I hated them and my teacher basically killed my passion for reading for a long time&amp;quot;. Let me start by saying that I don&amp;#39;t try to invalidate that feeling. I just want to put here my perspective as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let me give you some context. I think this holds for a lot of schools in my country (Czechia), but I know it&amp;#39;s definitely not the case in every school. We were taught about books and autors, but I don&amp;#39;t think I was ever forced to try to read and analyze something - usually someone read some excerpt of a book outloud and then we either simply continued, or sometimes the teacher explained it more in depth. And that was very rare. Only way in which we were forced to read was that for making our finals we were given a list of something like 100 or 200 books and we were to read 20 of them (with some restrictions - at least this many novels/plays/poetry/czech/foreign/20th century/18-19th century/before 17th century). At the finals we picked one of our chosen books at random and we were supposed to talk about it for some time and answer questions. Needless to say you usually didn&amp;#39;t need to actually read the books - some summary usually sufficed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, I used to love this model. I thought it was chosen well. And I don&amp;#39;t even claim now that it is a bad model. All I&amp;#39;m saying is that currently I wish I had been forced to do more at high school. Because nowadays I often read and I just feel that I&amp;#39;m missing the point, but I don&amp;#39;t know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read a lot of books that I didn&amp;#39;t actually enjoy that much, until I read what other people reading about it think - and what they can find in it. I am rarely capable of noticing beautiful prose unless someone points it out for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I dared myself and I read &lt;em&gt;Gravity&amp;#39;s Rainbow&lt;/em&gt; with the group on &lt;a href=&quot;/r/ThomasPynchon&quot;&gt;/r/ThomasPynchon&lt;/a&gt; and it was so great. Just to be clear, I definitely can&amp;#39;t say that the reading itself was always enjoyable - I was very frustrated very often. (And me not being native English speaker didn&amp;#39;t help.) But I always loved reading what other people see in it. And while I usually stop thinking about books quite soon after finishing them, I finished Gravity&amp;#39;s Rinbow in the fall of last year and I don&amp;#39;t think there was a week since then when I didn&amp;#39;t think about it once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is super rare. I usually read what other people think about a book after I finish it, but it&amp;#39;s kinda hard to appriciate it in retrospect - I like to see the things while I read. But I don&amp;#39;t want to reread the book I just finished and I also don&amp;#39;t want to read other peoples thinkpieces beforehand, because I kinda hate spoilers. So unless I can find those things myself, it&amp;#39;s a lose-lose situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m getting better in destiling the meaning (and other things) out of books, but I still don&amp;#39;t really know what to do - and I wish that I had a high school teacher who would force me to try it (lets be honest, this analysis is kinda hard, and, well, it&amp;#39;s hard to force myself to do hard things) and who would give me feedback about what I find and what I don&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to do this with poems. Poems seem to me as perfect format for learning analysing - they&amp;#39;re short, usually with nice prose and usually with some &amp;quot;deeper&amp;quot; meaning. I try to read a poem a day this year, but out of the more than 80 poems I read this year, I feel like I at least kinda succeded in analysing only about three or four. And poetry is hard, because I don&amp;#39;t know where to find analyzies of czech poems, so nobody really tells me what the &amp;quot;correct answer&amp;quot; is. (Yes, I&amp;#39;m aware, there is not really such thing as correct or incorrect analysis - but I wish I had &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; answer.) And while I often read novels in english, I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; struggle with english poems, so I don&amp;#39;t like this alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for being rambly, I just wanted to share my contraopinion to the succesful worldview I see in here.&lt;/p&gt;

It was the perfect balance of interest and magic for my son, while still being “mature” enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also read &lt;em&gt;Fortunately the Milk&lt;/em&gt; by Neil Gaiman which is a very different style but it’s still about an adventure, and while the story itself is pretty childish it is witty and clever enough that I genuinely enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roald Dahl books could also fit in this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find most kid’s chapter books are overly simplistic in their vocabulary and plot, with predictable one-dimensional characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are some other good adventurous chapter books that are either for adults but good for kids, or written for kids and good enough for adults? I want depth and clever writing and interesting plot and characters, but still on a level that a kid can understand and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit- I prefer it not be a series since there’s a decent chance my kid will lose interest and not let me read multiple books&lt;/p&gt;
