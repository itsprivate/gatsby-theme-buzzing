There have been many reasons why this is the case and it feels different to just being strong seasonality. Below are 15 ‘first time’ things to look out for in this sector to start the year with, with full credit going to John Quakes (@quakes99 on Twitter), a retired earth sciences researcher, professor, analyst, writer and one of the best public sources for news about the uranium sector. I share his view that 2021 will prove to be an incredible year for the uranium sector and subsequently for anyone invested in it. Now, onto the aforementioned ‘first times’: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time entering a new year with uranium already in a record supply deficit, which is set to deepen further with 2 major mines permanently closing this year in Australia and Niger (~7 million pounds, gone). At the same time, demand for nuclear energy has remained strong throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to grow in a global shift to decarbonize industry dependent on fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time that Cameco, the world’s 2nd largest producer, has begun a new year with every one of its uranium mines in Canada shut down. Both of the world’s 2 largest uranium mines are under care and maintenance, resulting in zero lbs being produced in Canada as we enter 2021. The US is also producing zero lbs while Kazakhstan’s production is at a multi-year low that is likely to continue thru 2022 under the nation’s current flex-down program and pandemic related mining disruptions. All uranium mines in the Ukraine have also been shut down due to the inability of the mine operator to pay the wages of 5000 mine workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fist time that at least 3 of the world’s largest uranium producers are forced into buying uranium on the spot market. Cameco is now the largest spot market buyer in the world. World’s largest producer Kazatomprom is now also a spot buyer, as is French Orano given that heir Canadian mills are suspended and their Cominak mine in Africa is heading for closure in March. Inventory held by the world’s largest uranium producers is at rock bottom levels for the first time ever and in need of replenishment this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time the US has taken steps to support its domestic uranium mining industry by establishing a strategic uranium reserve, a 10 year buying program (1.5 billion dollars total) whereby the US government will purchase, convert and potentially enrich US mined uranium to create an emergency supply for US reactors. Goal is to ensure at least 2 US uranium mining companies remain active and viable during this time when the commodity price of U3O8 is half the cost of production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time in several decades that there is strong bipartisan support in the US to rebuild the existing nuclear energy industry and manufacture a new generation of advanced reactors on a global scale, which is seen as a high priority in order to catch up with Russia and China who have become the new world leaders in nuclear energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time that uranium equities have entered a bull market when there is an actual supply deficit. The last bull market saw the price of uranium skyrocket on mine floods and other events that created the ‘fear’ of a supply deficit on the horizon, at a time when the US-Russia Megatons to Megawatts program was still continuing to supply 20m lbs per year to US nuclear utilities, a program that continued until 2021 as the world’s largest virtual uranium mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time that a new year begins with spot market supplies significantly depleted. Supply accessible to carry traders has been severely reduced. Kazatomprom no longer sells any lbs into the spot market and Orano’s supply from Canada and Niger is at a record low level, pushing nuclear utilities to secure new long term contracts with producers rather than entering into shorter term contracts with carry traders. Security of supply is a top priority of utilities (whose inventories are estimated to be around 2,5 years’ worth of supply, when the guideline is to never let it drop below 2-3 years given the long time it takes to enrich and deliver the fuel to the reactors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time that US and European nuclear utilities have begun a new year with inventories drawn down below usual safety margins at the same time that mines supply is in a record deficit and global uranium production is at its lowest level in 12 years. The new 2020 IAEA/NEA uranium Red Book projects that secondary supplies will fall in the future as an overdue utility inventory restocking cycle begins, due to higher levels of contracting, conversion and enrichment that will reduce underfeeding as facilities see their utilization rates rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time in several years that there are no geopolitical overhangs holding back the uranium contracting plans of US and European nuclear utilities. There are no potential section 232 actions targeting uranium imports and no sanctions likely against UUN participants (Russia, China, UK, Germany, France) in the JCPOA Iran Nuclear deal. Russia and the US have successfully negotiated a 20-year extension to the Russian Suspension Agreement that will see the US imports from Russia decline over the coming 2 decades. The incoming US administration supports keeping nuclear power plants running and plans to immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, pushing for global net zero emissions by 2050, a process in which nuclear energy will play a major role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time that nations around the world will be recovering from a global pandemic with massive infrastructure spending programs that include boosting nuclear capacity to achieve net zero carbon emissions goals. A new ‘nuclear renaissance’ is beginning to take shape on pandemic recovery spending to boost clean energy. The perception of nuclear energy is also changing to that of a safe, reliable, necessary baseload power source that fits with an emerging ESG investing model. Decarbonization has become a new buzz word in the global vocabulary. The ‘electrification of everything’ from cars, buses, trucks and trains to major industry is the new global target. Sustainability of so-called renewables solar and wind is now being called into question after failures by Germany and California to successfully transition to an economy powered by intermittent energy sources. Higher electricity prices, no net carbon emissions reductions and rolling blackouts have demonstrated how ‘renewables’ are not able to fulfill their early promise. This might change with new battery technology and better implementation, but we are nowhere near that point yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time that uranium stocks are entering a new year on the heels of one of their best performance years since the last bull market. The U3O8 spot price is still one-half the global average cost of production that will incentivize new mines to be built this decade. This signals to investors that we are still at the opening pitch of the first inning of a long game yet to play out. A necessary doubling of the U3O8 commodity price is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time that Canada has begun a new year embarking on a small modular reactors build-out program with several provinces pledging to deploy SMR’s to power remote communities, mines and industrial heat applications in the energy industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time that nuclear is being viewed as the ideal carbon free high-temperature power source to produce clear hydrogen fuel. US, Russia, Japan and others are looking to leverage their existing nuclear power capacity to produce hydrogen and build high-temperature SMR’s to optimize the use of emissions free nuclear to produce zero emissions hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time in decades that there is an emerging surge in acceptance of nuclear  of nuclear energy as necessary to achieve zero carbon emissions goals, with countries like the Netherlands looking to add more capacity after conducting studies showing nuclear is safer and cheaper than variable renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time I can recall one of the leading nuclear fuel consultants UxC reporting to their subscribers that uranium is in a 57M lbs mined supply deficit, that utility and supplier inventories are “declining at a rapid rate” just as global fuel demand growth is accelerating, a clear signal that a bull market is getting underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: with all the catalysts that are in place, I am of the firm believe that uranium related equities, namely the developers and explorers, will offer returns that will outperform any other broad investment asset class/sector in the market. This is a bold claim to make, but I can’t see any other opportunity that offers even close to the same risk vs reward the uranium sector offers. Read my other posts on the subject to get an idea of what companies you might want to look at and to get an answer to any question you might have. Good luck and here is to a great new year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla has slashed prices of its made-in-China Model Y cars to woo drivers in the world’s largest electric vehicle market, ratcheting up pressure on its global and Chinese rivals that focus on the premium segment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Long Range version of Model Y starts from 339,000 yuan (US$52,074), excluding a government subsidy, 30 per cent cheaper than the price quoted six months ago when presale orders could first be placed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local media reported that some drivers who previously ordered cars by Tesla challengers – NIO, Xpeng and Li Auto – have reneged on their contracts and were looking to buy Model Y.&lt;/p&gt;

I learned about NIO over two years ago when they were featured on 60 Minutes and was one of the first active users on &lt;a href=&quot;/r/Nio&quot;&gt;r/Nio&lt;/a&gt;. Back then, the stock was 10$, and I bought 500 shares. But after their IPO, they had a rough year with declining sales. Despite that, I kept buying in to eventually accumulate 3,200 shares at an average price of 3.12$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then came more bad news and worse sales. People were talking about the company running out of cash and the stock going to 0$, and they did eventually hit 1.00$. I sold at 1.78$ before that happened and took my 57% loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only been investing for two years, but it&amp;#39;s my biggest regret so far. I should have never listened to some asshole at Bloomberg getting paid to write negative articles and trusted my gut. NIO is a solid company and is going to be one the leaders in the Chinese and global EV market. They completely restructured after those losses (Nio Places vs. Nio Houses, fired staff, etc.), and those 3,200 shares are worth over 150,000$ today. They&amp;#39;ll be worth even more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can do now is take this as a learning experience, but I feel like I&amp;#39;ll never find another stock like them. Sigh ...&lt;/p&gt;

Here&amp;#39;s a breakdown of why we&amp;#39;re likely not anywhere close to 2000 levels of craziness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First:&lt;/strong&gt;  During the dot-com era, the Nasdaq Composite&amp;#39;s price-to-earnings valuation ran up as high as 200. By comparison, the index&amp;#39;s P/E today is a relatively tame 28, only modestly higher from 23 at the end of 2019. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second:&lt;/strong&gt; Interest rates were a very attractive 6% which provided a strong alternative to stocks. No such outlet exists today unless you trust bitcoin, or want to invest in paper gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third:&lt;/strong&gt; Much of the value gains we&amp;#39;re seeing in the market can be tied directly to the fact that people who invest are making similar or better money this year, and spending significantly less causing them to save more and invest more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html&quot;&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth:&lt;/strong&gt; The rest of the growth can largely be attributed to increased liquidity from all of the money printing. Stocks tend to mirror an increase in the money supply with their value making them a great hedge against inflation. The valuations of the 2000s weren&amp;#39;t backstopped by QE or increased savings, making them much shakier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fifth:&lt;/strong&gt; The money printing will likely go on for a while. People mistakenly assume we&amp;#39;re printing against our 22T dollar economy when we&amp;#39;re really printing against the 80-100T global economy for which are the reserve currency. A weak dollar benefits the global economy, and benefits us because we are the trading floor for the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a long but very illuminating read on why QE is necessary and actually helpful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/&quot;&gt;https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Take:&lt;/strong&gt; There are a few stocks that are out of control with their valuations (Hi TSLA!), and a few sectors that are overvalued, but overall the market looks to be on sturdy ground with the increased savings, and the increased liquidity. There will be peaks and valleys, but I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of room to grow, especially once the vaccine is widespread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be my top 10:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Apple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not see a point in dividend stocks like PG, Coke, Caterpillar, etc. when you are young and have 30+ years for these stocks to grow and go through their ups and downs. My plan is to let these positions grow and then cash out when I retire and invest in safe dividend stocks for income.&lt;/p&gt;

For reference, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915&quot;&gt;please refer to the Twitter thread here&lt;/a&gt; which has some fantastic notes and charts that I did not paste into the transcript below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there have been so many comparisons recently discussing tech froth, I think this is a wonderful share, especially for the majority of people here who were not investors during that time period. Definitely sheds a lot of light on some popular market cliches that misconstrue that period (IE, &amp;quot;you can only recognize a bubble in hindsight&amp;quot;).  I do not know or follow this person, but still thought this was worth sharing as I came across it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons From The Tech Bubble:  Last year, I spent my winter holiday reading hundreds of pages of equity research from the 1999/2000 era, to try to understand what it was like investing during the bubble  A few people recently asked me for my takeaways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here they are - Every document hereon comes from my former employer Bernstein Research&amp;#39;s internal research archive, which extend back to 1994  Unfortunately, they&amp;#39;re not available to the public (even Bernstein&amp;#39;s client website cuts off at 2003), but happy to give more details if necessary (see twitter thread for graphic documents).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON #1&lt;/strong&gt;: Everybody knew it was a bubble  Unfortunately, the quip &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not a bubble if everyone says it is&amp;quot; just isn&amp;#39;t true  Investors were comparing the internet sector to tulip mania as early as mid-98. Bernstein held an entire conference on it in June 99! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON #2:&lt;/strong&gt; Calling bubbles is easy, making money is hard  In truth, the hard part about the tech bubble wasn&amp;#39;t noticing it. The hard part was timing it  Our equity strategist tried in January 99... he was off by 14 months (and another 30 point gap in value vs growth) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON #3:&lt;/strong&gt; Nobody knew the bubble popped until months after it did  Nobody noticed in March 2000 when it finally popped. Our equity strategist (who bet his career on it!) didn&amp;#39;t catch on until June &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON #4:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Tech&amp;quot; bubble was a misnomer... it was really a large cap growth bubble  See the valuation table below, 1 year before the top  Yes, Microsoft traded at 70x earnings. But Coca Cola was 43x. Pfizer was 92x. Every stock here was a disaster over the next 10 years... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON #5:&lt;/strong&gt; Most large cap tech stocks in the bubble had real businesses with strong fundamentals  The internet stocks were a sideshow. In 2000, the software sector had a $1 trillion market cap, 20% net margins, 20% annual growth  The problem? It was trading at 16x sales &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON #6:&lt;/strong&gt; Fundamentals follow price, not vice versa  The bubble popped in Q1 2000. Fundamentals didn&amp;#39;t decelerate until Q4 2000.   It was reflexivity at work. Lower stock prices = less capex spend = less revenue growth = lower stock prices. A vicious cycle &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the takeaway here?   Be humble.  For bears, it&amp;#39;s easy to call a bubble. Anybody can do that. Timing is the hard part  For bulls, it&amp;#39;s easy to point to the fundamentals. Historical investors weren&amp;#39;t dumb. The hard part is matching fundamentals with price...&lt;/p&gt;

I think one of the delusions people are having lately is that they look at what people projected for AMZN 5-10-15 years ago and compare that to what actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is true that AMZN exceeded any sort of expectation by a huge margin (and did this consistently, year over year) it feels to me that we are taking perhaps one of the most unique success stories ever and then extrapolate that to others, thinking that as if those sort of growth and expectations are in fact more common and easy to achieve than not, regardless of the industry the subject company is operating in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could discuss this for a number of stocks, I wanted to open discussion for TSLA. As we all know, TSLA stock went up almost 8 fold in the last year. Today, it is common occurrence in the market that analysts are justifying these price levels and state why TSLA is just more than a car company. This argument obviously has its own merits, but aren&amp;#39;t we little ahead ourselves and already attribute &lt;em&gt;from today,&lt;/em&gt; all those things that could potentially be achieved and bake it into the price?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we went back in in time, we could probably say AMZN was more than just a book company, but could we really say that they would have almost monopolistic power in most of the areas they operated in? Could we really say back in 2008 that AMZN would emerge the market leader in something like for instance Cloud? Or, did these things happen and then we realized how great AMZN became, &lt;em&gt;after the fact.&lt;/em&gt; It feels like this was much easier to do in hindsight. But what if AMZN is truly that one outlier, anomaly, in the history of stock markets in terms of sustained growth and market power?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t this what we are trying to do with TSLA here? I do think Elon is one of the greatest minds of our time and can achieve far beyond any other has achieved so I am not comparing Bezos or any other with Elon here. But what I am trying to say is that, just thinking TSLA as a company, aren&amp;#39;t we already saying today that they already have monopolistic power in EV cars, autonomous driving, solar-energy trade, underground tunnels, robotaxis, etc. - you name it, as if they are already there and waiting to be switched on? It&amp;#39;s as if we have already attributed everything we could imagine could happen and already announced TSLA as the winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is the theory side of things. &lt;strong&gt;How about financial side of things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to approach this from a car sales point of view, but I will make certain comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if we applied AMZN&amp;#39;s growth trajectory into TSLA, without focusing too much on car sales, and just see what growth and valuation that would lead us? If TSLA is just more than a car company, what other example could serve best in terms of growth, thinking from an array of products and technological advantage perspective?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did a quick and dirty DCF calculation. In there, my starting point is the first year when AMZN hit $24 billion in revenue, which is 2009. TSLA achieved it&amp;#39;s $24 billion in 2019, so from there onwards I am applying AMZN&amp;#39;s growth trajectory for the following 10-11 years. Then, growth is gradually reduced in going into the terminal year. What this means is TSLA will be roughly $900 billion revenue generating company by year 20 (2040). From a car sales perspective, I can&amp;#39;t really project how many cars it could sell in 20 years, but lets say it is 10 million cars. (I think GS said 15 million). Toyota in 2019 sold around this number I believe so with all the competition that will happen in this space, I think this is by no means and under-estimation. In 2019, TSLA sold roughly 367,500 cars and for a total revenue of $19.2 billion (excluding regulatory credits). On average this equates to $52k per car. In 20 years, car prices will be higher than what they are today obviously, but there will be competition and economies of scale to bring the price down. This one is hard to assume but let&amp;#39;s say it grows 1.0% - 1.5% per year with long term inflation, again not necessarily higher because of these offsetting factors. If they do indeed sell 10+ million cars, this is roughly $600-650 billion from cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves you with another $200-250 billion or so for other things, whatever you want to attribute this for - AI, robotaxies, insurance, and so on. Now this figure is a future value, so from today&amp;#39;s perspective (using a discount rate of 8% used in my DCF below) that&amp;#39;s roughly $60 billion (revenue). This is again a huge number, as it is almost another Facebook, 2x Coca-Cola etc., or half of GM/Toyota type business from revenue generating capability, again, from &lt;em&gt;today&amp;#39;s perspective - none of which has already happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again I want to point out that my revenue projections are not driven by bottoms-up car sales, rather, I am using simply AMZN trajectory in terms of growth, then try to attribute the resulting final revenue figure into parts, obviously majority being from car sales, and the rest from whatever you can think of. (Simply because we don&amp;#39;t know what AI/Robos/Insurance/Transportation businesses can generate from revenue/profitability/market share perspective and more importantly what the competition in those areas can be). If you think TSLA can grow even more than AMZN, then I just want to remind you that you won&amp;#39;t easily justify 40-50% revenue growth rates once you&amp;#39;re in the 50+ billion zone, which is the point of the argument. AMZN, still achieved those growth rates when it had 100+ or 200+ billion, which is what we are already assuming here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the stock price we have baked in, from a revenue perspective, a car business that will sell at least 10+ million cars (this number can obviously be higher but even 10 million will be big market share),  and other businesses that are worth, today, more than most companies you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is the growth side of things. How about margins?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know TSLA generated a last twelve months EBITDA margin of 14% as of Q3 2020. While margins from car manufacturing is certainly improving, most of this margin is actually attributed to sales of regulatory credits, which are by definition almost 100% profit. And so in reality, the margins are much lower, maybe around low single digits between 1-5%. Now this is important because even with all this revenue growth (and if you disagree with me and think it will even be higher), you still need to achieve big margins on your business. I mean really really good margins, we are talking about 15-25% each year. Interestingly, AMZN, while growing its top line crazily over the years and becoming a behemoth as it is today, always lacked in terms of their margins. That goes without saying they are a tech company that typically exhibit great returns on capital. So the point is they had to sacrifice their margins to be able to achieve this growth and this is an important point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my DCF, I am extremely generous. I kept TSLA&amp;#39;s EBITDA margins at 15% for the next 3 years, bumped to 17.5%, 20.0%, then to finally 25.0% every 3 years in going forward. Once again these regulatory credits will not be there forever so those margins are extremely optimistic at this point. They might indeed achieve 25% margins in 10 years or so but it won&amp;#39;t be this smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these two major factors, other items in the DCF are not super important. The discount rate is 8.0%, which I believe is reasonable, NWC and Capex assumptions are in line with what they are today and I don&amp;#39;t think they would necessarily go down (if not go up). I just want to mention that you may completely disagree with some of the assumptions I outlined above. The point however is no matter what sort of DCF you come up with, you will end up either with lower or slight higher value for TSLA, using very, very aggressive assumptions for 10+ years. So the point and question is around the &lt;strong&gt;margin of safety&lt;/strong&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems I can&amp;#39;t directly post pictures so here is the link for the DCF:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh&quot;&gt;https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might wonder, well your price is even higher than what it is today so why did you write this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again my whole point in the argument was that the margin of error in TSLA&amp;#39;s stock price right now is non-existent, because we&amp;#39;ve already treated it the next AMZN, gave the best margins possible, attributed big bucks on its other stuff. I think my DCF is still in the unreasonable side, but I wanted to point this out that even a s&lt;em&gt;light change in trajectory would mean a totally different path and stock price for TSLA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question is, are we ahead of ourselves with TSLA? This could also apply to others as well, this so called growth companies. It is as if we are pricing everything today and think that they have already achieved incredible market share in everything they touched and it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time that these revenue/profits are realized. Are we taking one anomaly and applying this rationale for every other great company under the name of &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s tech&amp;quot;? Elon is great and TSLA will be great. But the business model may not just allow them to be the next AMZN, regardless of technology or improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final comment I will make is related to autonomous driving and data TSLA is collecting. While it is for certain that this data gives TSLA an incredible power in developing this technology, I see couple of issues with this as it relates to future of this thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Facebook are big not because of their software, but because of the network effects they exhibit. And because of those network effects they become larger and larger and are able to collect more data, which creates an incredibly profitable cycle for them as they can monetize that data right away. Data for TSLA here only matters in developing that technology. Monetization however, is another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am not entirely sure with all this AI story is that if it needs to continuously get updated for use, then how do regulators/companies determine the older version was safe to use to begin with. What I understand is that AI is something that needs to get constantly updated based on data, challenge here is that you are carrying people&amp;#39;s lives here (as opposed to targeting ads) so there needs to be an infliction point where the full autonomous driving AI software should be at a point where it is certainly 100% safe to use. Because if it is not, then the technology fails until it reaches to that point. If it does reach out to that point, then how difficult is it going to be for others to get to that point or use similar technology if what you need is to get from point A to B safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides there is the price factor in as well. Let&amp;#39;s say TSLA is the only one who can do this. If autonomous driving is too expensive, then how much will people pay for it? Say if the car is 50k and you have to pay extra 50k on top of that - would you do this? Would this have a cannibalization effect? Or if it is monthly subscription fees, would you go on to pay this forever? How significant will the cost be in 20 years from now when others presumably also start providing some sort of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if it is not expensive and only a fraction of the car price, then how are you going to achieve these growth levels with that data and technology to begin with. It is one thing to have a great technology, another to monetize it. They might license it for sure, but then you lose all that power right away. So the question then becomes, will it be a niche product or commodity at the end of the day - either of which will not allow you to have incredible returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
