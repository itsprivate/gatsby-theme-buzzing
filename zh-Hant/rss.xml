&lt;p&gt;I think it would be interesting to see how the market did with other highly speculative investments that gained traction so quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any examples in the near or distant past?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how about absolute size in market cap. Did any other company in the history of mankind gained $500 Billion in market cap in 12 months?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I am interested in what the stock market is doing over decades. Not so much in what it does over days. Anybody else here interested in such long term observations?&lt;/p&gt;

I was on a steady downtrend for the first 2 months (while the general market is on a steady uptrend) and found my account balance to be below $850. I had to take a break at this point and had serious thoughts about giving up. I thought I wasn&amp;#39;t cut out to be a trader; I must be a part of the 95% who fail.  I decided to give it one more shot. I took a deep analytical dive into my past trades. I reevaluated my strategy, and found what was working and what wasn&amp;#39;t. I slowly started seeing results. I clawed my way back to the original $1000 investment and today have officially hit the $100 profit mark. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone is still reading this, I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking: &amp;quot;Wow, 100 bucks, big deal,&amp;quot; and you&amp;#39;re right. It&amp;#39;s not much. However, If an average guy like myself can grow his account 10%, I strongly believe that anyone can; with enough dedication. I&amp;#39;d be happy to talk more about my journey to anyone who&amp;#39;s interested or just starting out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may recall I wrote a post on here not too long ago on how GMO food plays could be the next hot sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who didn‚Äôt and would like to find out more, have a read and read the comments. It was a great/informative discussion that didn‚Äôt revolve around ‚ÄúBUY PLTR OR BUY DKNG‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good DD and suggested plays, enjoy;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jbc4v7/the_next_hot_sector_food_gene_editing_stocks/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jbc4v7/the_next_hot_sector_food_gene_editing_stocks/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who did read or had an interest in it, I just thought I would provide an update on how they are going. I think this sector is going to have a huge year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My post was 91 days ago  and my suggested plays were;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corteva (CTVA)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$33.82 Now: $44.13&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precision Bioscience (DTIL)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$6.52 Now: $9.80&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calyxt (CLXT)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$5.07 Now: $4.76
(offering/dilution occurred soon after, not ideal but has been steadily climbing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yield 10 Bioscience (YTEN)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$6.49 Now: $7.61&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Origin Argitech (SEED)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$9.63 Now: $16.51&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was getting a lot of DMs about the original post so said it would be easier to do an update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer a few questions, I am still very, very bullish on this sector. I think it is only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation and largest holding from the above is SEED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEED have been working for 10 years to get their GMO right and approved by government, finally they are in and the government is ready to roll out GMO in China. SEED will dominate this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has had a huge run so far but there are way more catalysts ahead and with a 3 million share float, this going to go parabolic soon. Shorts covering the higher it inevitably goes, think GameStop, Nio, XPEV type of runs , the ones that just look outrageous on your watch list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about the opportunity for SEED here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321851/000110465920094375/tm2027521d1_ex99-1.htm&quot;&gt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321851/000110465920094375/tm2027521d1_ex99-1.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEED turned down $24 a share in 2014.
The CFO commented ‚ÄúI tell people the value of this company is Monsanto multiplied by Baidu divided by Google,‚Äù Talk about being bullish and keeping the faith. He was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, before commenting mindless comments, ‚ÄúBUY PLTR‚Äù ‚ÄúPUMP IT‚Äù , just read the original post where I dived deep or do a quick google on GMO or the stocks above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of newbies, so many pump and dumpers but genuine, informative posts about companies still exist on here. I still love this sub!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm a long term investor so I‚Äôm not to bothered by short term volatility. SEEDs all time high was around $170 15 years ago. In a few months, SEED can be up at 30-40 and I think in a year , it can be at $100, no problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoyed and hope everyone has a great year investing!&lt;/p&gt;

Let me remind you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melvin Capital bet that GameStop would go bankrupt. If it had, those assholes would&amp;#39;ve been dancing in their New York offices, popping champagne and laughing, completely aware of the damage they were rejoicing in. They tried to capitalize on a global pandemic as the final nail in the coffin for yet another retail company that wouldn&amp;#39;t change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, things would&amp;#39;ve been pretty grim. GameStop workers make, what, slightly more than minimum wage? They are probably completely unaware of companies like Melvin Capital who hope their employer goes out of business. They&amp;#39;re just trying to make a buck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GameStop may have an outdated business model that hasn&amp;#39;t adapted to 2011, let alone 2021, but it&amp;#39;s an American institution. Every single one of us has walked into a GameStop at least once and bought a game we were excited about. Our little brothers and sisters would beg us to take them there to buy the 80th edition of Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow/Gold/whatever. We&amp;#39;ve all perused a Game Informer, hoping to see a 10 rating. You can shit on them for charging too much or not paying enough for a used game, but you don&amp;#39;t hope their people go on unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Melvin Capital and short sellers (lol &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/wxohwokyrab61.jpg&quot;&gt;Frankfurt School Associates&lt;/a&gt;) can go fuck themselves. Go read about these assholes if you want to put a smile on your face, knowing what they&amp;#39;re dealing with right now. I hope Gabriel Plotkin has to sell his $40 million Miami mansion (he just bought it in December). Hell, I hope Ryan Cohen buys it from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positions&lt;/strong&gt;: Half my Roth IRA in GME shares. A few calls. Just like a lot of you, not enough to really make a difference. But together we can slay giants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exit Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;: I have no sell orders. I&amp;#39;ll sell when someone posts a story about Melvin Capital going bankrupt. Fuck em.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t fucking sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NHTSA grades vehicles based on a series of scenarios, including frontal crashes, with subcategories for the driver and passenger seats, side crashes involving poles and barriers, and a rollover. The Model Y has a rollover risk of 7.9%, the lowest of any SUV recorded to date by the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Model Y is &amp;quot;engineered to distribute crash forces around the cabin and away from vehicle occupants, greatly reducing the risk of injury,&amp;quot; according to the automaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Safety is at the core of every Tesla vehicle, and Model Y benefits from years of immense passion for vehicle safety,&amp;quot; Tesla added. &amp;quot;By providing the most advanced equipment and technologies, our goal is to help customers prevent avoidable accidents whenever possible, and, when they are not avoidable, to help mitigate injury to the fullest extent possible. Indeed, we believe Model Y to be among the safest vehicles available to consumers on the road.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Alibaba continues to push into the EV world. Intel spikes while AMD &amp;amp; TSM suffer. Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market finishing mixed, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/qybhmjC&quot;&gt;Nasdaq Composite&lt;/a&gt; gaining .43%, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/YL4XS6m&quot;&gt;SP500&lt;/a&gt; also gaining .23% while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/YTFwLcx&quot;&gt;Dow Jones&lt;/a&gt; lost just 8 points to close out the day. We also saw the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/0r28dsT&quot;&gt;VIX&lt;/a&gt; dropping almost 5% again, continuing the downtrend after that huge spike with the Georgia elections, as it sits at similar levels to the ones before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the positive gains for the broad stock market SP500, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/PrDh7DD&quot;&gt;OVERALL&lt;/a&gt;, we saw about 57% of the companies declining yesterday, with most of them trading below average volumes, as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average still sits over 70%, which is pretty high. Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/wJH4B8C&quot;&gt;SECTORS&lt;/a&gt; finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1% while the laggards were Energy, Industrials and Materials, as we saw large-cap growth companies finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/kKtRY96&quot;&gt;OUTPERFORMED&lt;/a&gt; for once in 2021, with small &amp;amp; mid-caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year, though, Large-Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3% compared to the next factor group in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/Ms0qkCh&quot;&gt;HEAT MAP&lt;/a&gt; from yesterday, which shows pretty mixed results as expected, with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and the rest of the bunch, with Alibaba posting a 4% gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7% and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/QXXDBrc&quot;&gt;DEFICIT&lt;/a&gt; fell by $2B to $143B in December compared to the previous month, but is up 10 fold from the $13B deficit from the same period in 2019, and this doesn‚Äôt even include any of the $900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December, while the December consumer price &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/n1Jr9G2&quot;&gt;INDEX&lt;/a&gt; increased by 0.4% m/m and Core CPI also increase by 0.1%, coming in-line with expectations, as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/t2v98jw&quot;&gt;ROSE&lt;/a&gt; to 2.2% in January compared to December, though sales and profit margins compared to normal, decreased since the last month, while one of the FED‚Äôs Vice Chairs &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/WtNxQKM&quot;&gt;RESTATED&lt;/a&gt; that the FED won‚Äôt raise rates until the average long-term inflation stands at 2% for a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/C79879d&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt; we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning, which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going, and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as $2T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some other stock market news, we saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/9bHNxrx&quot;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership, this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM, AMD &amp;amp; others, but I think this is more of a ‚Äúhype move‚Äù right now. Intel has still fallen behind it‚Äôs competition and it will take massive Capex and R&amp;amp;D investments to catch up, so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point, especially for AMD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/Phk4N4s&quot;&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4.3% increase in traffic and a massive 12.3% increase in the average ticket, as comparable digital sales more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also saw, their same-day services post an impressive growth of almost 200%, as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector, as 95% of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of ¬æ of the US population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, guys, these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks, with company after company issuing shares, with the latest ones being &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/qDRKJ7Y&quot;&gt;Nano&lt;/a&gt; Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20% while &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/27StT0c&quot;&gt;Lemonade&lt;/a&gt; has also increased their stock offering by another 300.000 shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in another kind of news we saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/pLMSXrb&quot;&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57%, after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90% at one point. This has happened after GameStop has &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/F3S2XTT&quot;&gt;PUSHED&lt;/a&gt; for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e-commerce and online marketing world, with 3 veterans from Chewy, which has been an impressive performer in the online e-commerce business. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/y8XVnd7&quot;&gt;STOCK&lt;/a&gt; Is up another 20% in pre-market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/vjKdwKW&quot;&gt;Alibaba&lt;/a&gt; making a couple of headlines yesterday, which helped push the stocks 4% higher, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba, Baidu &amp;amp; Tencent, while also continuing their charge into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/0tVsJSS&quot;&gt;EV&lt;/a&gt; world, with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China‚Äôs state owned SAIC Motor. This is their latest push into the EV world, as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng. This news, might help the stock see a recovery, that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one last piece of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/Z8RSWQL&quot;&gt;NEWS&lt;/a&gt; is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90$, more than 80% above the IPO price, as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading, but unfortunately, retail investors do not benefit from this, as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price, is under 10% while also risking a severe drop in the next days. Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action, which will benefit most of the people, not just the ‚Äúbig players‚Äù who get in at much lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s NextEra Energy? Summarized from Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is the largest electric utility in the USA by market capitalization. (At 160B currently)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenues of over $19.20 billion in 2019. Operating income of $5.35 billion in 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 14,000 employees throughout the US and Canada.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The important subsidiaries include

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Utilities;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Florida Power &amp;amp; Light (FPL) - A Florida electric utility. Notable for having wider profit margins than usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gulf Power Company - Electric utility in the Alabama area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NextEra Energy Capital Holdings (NEECH)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NextEra  Energy Resources (NEER) - The largest operators of wind and solar  projects in the world. Importantly, expansive holdings in the Midwest.  Also has numerous energy storage projects under their belt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They also have a 35% stake in NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) with Jim Robo being the CEO of both companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/fixed-income-investors/financial-policy&quot;&gt;In  fact, I&amp;#39;ll just direct you to NextEra&amp;#39;s IR page, because for some  reason they&amp;#39;ve placed a very solid series of pages outlining their  financial health where almost nobody will find them.&lt;/a&gt; You can flip  through the Policy, Strength, Funding/Capital Structure, Cash  Flow/Leverage, and Liquidity pages there at your leisure to understand  more about the company. But basically, they&amp;#39;re extremely healthy as a  company. Notably, they&amp;#39;ve been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/11-02-2020-222338600&quot;&gt;unwinding positions for cash&lt;/a&gt; recently despite their solid balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now,  I&amp;#39;d like to point out their P/E: 41. Yup, this is a &amp;quot;boring&amp;quot; utility company trading at 41x P/E after running up 200% in 5 years and 80% in  2. For reference, Microsoft is trading at 34.90 P/E. As far as utilities  go, I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say these guys are as far from boring as it  gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary of the fundamentals;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management is extremely reliable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&amp;#39;re the market leader in renewables deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&amp;#39;ve proven they know how to compete and edge out profits in cutthroat industries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High P/E, but in a stable industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have plenty of leverage available for massive capital expenditures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now  onto why I think they will collect more than their fair share of  Biden&amp;#39;s upcoming stimulus. Let&amp;#39;s start off by looking at what Biden has  been pushing in his announcements;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing the environmental costs onto polluters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing renewables directly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating long-term middle class union jobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among utilities, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/12-11-2020-173514490&quot;&gt;NextEra stands out as an early and consistent investor in renewables&lt;/a&gt;. Straight from the link above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According  to S&amp;amp;P Global Trucost, NextEra Energy ranked ahead of its peers on a  number of impressive reported performance metrics, among others,  including signed contracts to build approximately 12,000 megawatts of  additional wind, solar and battery storage projects as of the close of  2019, and NextEra Energy&amp;#39;s announced target of emissions reductions per  unit of generation by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline, equivalent, to a  40% reduction in absolute emissions ‚Äì and this, despite an expected  doubling of generation over the period. Already, NextEra Energy reports  more than 50% of its generation is from zero- and near-zero-emitting  sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say that point 1 will hurt them much less than it will their less progressive competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally,  as a result of their investments so far, they&amp;#39;re not untested when it  comes to deployment: They know what to expect and we know they can  execute on larger CapEx programs with less risk than the competition. If  Biden is to throw the expected 40 billion a year into the industry,  it&amp;#39;s quite likely NextEra will be ready to scale up operations  sustainably and successfully to capitalize on the opportunity, clearing  point two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But point three is the  really interesting one. Let me start off with a question; If you were a  democratic president that wanted to create middle-class jobs in  renewables, how would you go about it? Would you invest in the companies  making the end product? Maybe a little for the companies that pull the  required resources out of the ground too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/khx7eb/stimulus_bill_includes_35_billion_for_clean/&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#39;s  take a look at what the clean energy portion stimulus bill a few weeks  ago contained and see how NextEra is positioned for each portion.&lt;/a&gt; Big thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/u/millerlit/&quot;&gt;/u/millerlit&lt;/a&gt; for summarizing. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/reports-and-filings/annual-reports&quot;&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be referencing the NextEra 2019 annual report from this point on&lt;/a&gt;. Please bring up a copy if you&amp;#39;d like to verify the numbers I claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1.5 Billion for Solar - Will probably go to most industry players pretty  equally, NextEra will get a cut as a result of their investing through NEER. 12% of NEER&amp;#39;s generation is from solar power according to the 2019 annual report (p.13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$2.6 Billion for Transport - NextEra probably won&amp;#39;t get much of this, but they have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/12-08-2020-123104618&quot;&gt;made an acquisition&lt;/a&gt; in the field within the last month. It would be a nice perk if they  announced major projects here, but let&amp;#39;s just leave this as a  hypothetical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1.7 billion for a Weatherization Assistance Program - I&amp;#39;m not 100% sure how  they&amp;#39;ll break this down, but up here in Canada they do these programs  as rebates through utility providers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fpl.com/save/programs.html&quot;&gt;NextEra is almost definitely going to get a cut of this as far as I can see.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1.08 billion for short-term, long-term, seasonal and transportation energy  storage technologies - NextEra is pretty big in the battery storage  field. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/nextera-energy-to-spend-1b-on-energy-storage-projects-in-2021&quot;&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ll be the ones developing a new battery chemistry, but they&amp;#39;re definitely a serious user.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$2.36 billion for smart utility and energy distribution technologies.¬†-  They&amp;#39;re going to get a serious cut of this for obvious reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$625  million for new research, development and commercialization for both  onshore and offshore wind technologies - 65% of NEER&amp;#39;s renewables  generation is wind power according to the 2019 annual report. They&amp;#39;re  going to get a nice cut here too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$850 million for geothermal technology development - Nothing here will go to NextEra, as far as I&amp;#39;m aware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1093 million for marine energy and hydropower tech - Nothing here will go to NextEra, as far as I&amp;#39;m aware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$500 million pot for industry and transportation looking to decarbonize - 0 stake in this race&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$6.2  billion for carbon capture utilization and storage technologies - FPL  is investing quite heavily here, as 74% of their generation back in 2019  was from Natural Gas (p.9). They&amp;#39;re going to get a good portion of  this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$6.6  billion in funding for the modernization of existing nuclear power  plants and the development of advanced reactors - FPL generated 22% of  their power from Nuclear in 2019 (p.9). They&amp;#39;re probably going to get a  fair slice of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$4.7 billion for fusion industry - NextEra isn&amp;#39;t spending money on fusion development, as far as I&amp;#39;m aware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looser  regulations for using government land for renewables - A nice gesture  to drop land costs by increasing supply for sustainable uses. &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/US_federal_land.agencies.svg/1280px-US_federal_land.agencies.svg.png&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a map of US public land so you can take a look.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you get the point by now - NextEra has a slice in a lot of these pies directly. On top of that, the renewables segment as a whole is going to hugely benefit from the stimulus driving down the capital expenditures required for panels and turbines. Frankly, there are very few people  better positioned than a well-run utility company with massive credit  available taking on the debt at great rates. When I put it like that, it&amp;#39;s no surprise that these folks managed to thrive under Trump&amp;#39;s policies - and that they&amp;#39;re extremely well positioned to grow aggressively under Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s even a fun political trap for the republicans here. Do you know  where the best place to place on-shore wind turbines is? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/images/itl/sed/gsg/mri50_2mph_inc_gumbel_v2.png&quot;&gt;The midwest&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/maps-non-hurricane-non-tornadic-extreme-wind-speeds-contiguous-united-states&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;) - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;amp;q=US+2020+election+results&quot;&gt;A notable republican stronghold area&lt;/a&gt;. NEER&amp;#39;s own wind turbine deployment map in the annual report (p.13) backs up that their expansion is largely in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised at all if the Democrats quietly slated a lot of  the renewables spending into the midwest in an attempt to entrench a pro-union and pro-clean energy vote there - forcing the republican platform into a weird spot in future elections. It helps that that&amp;#39;s pretty much the economical way to play it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, I think NextEra&amp;#39;s going to be a serious beneficiary of the renewables bill however it ends up going down, even if only because of their financial resources, deployment experience, and contracts with  suppliers. A big portion of this is that I don&amp;#39;t believe the market has  priced in the amount they&amp;#39;re collecting directly and indirectly because  the response so far seems to have been &amp;quot;FAN/TAN/ICLN/QCLN goes brrrrr&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about the competition; The other US utility companies that were  listed as leaders in the clean energy transition by Global Platts are  Dominion Energy, Sempra Energy, and Xcel Energy. From one look at them  it seems like they&amp;#39;re (1) much smaller and (2) at best half off on P/E  so I didn&amp;#39;t really look at them too hard if I&amp;#39;m being honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the bigger question; Do I grab NEE or [clean energy ETF of choice]?  Really, it&amp;#39;s up to you. I think that the clean energy ETFs are trading  at downright idiotic valuations now. That, and I&amp;#39;d much rather bet on  one or two known strong performers that I believe in than I would on a  bunch of companies picked by someone else. That being said, those ETFs  have much more hype behind them, which is an important consideration in  this market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short-term catalysts  are basically the stimulus bill and earnings on the 26th. I expect some  big announcements on how they plan to capitalize on the bill during the  earnings call, and a huge bump in interest if they announce that they&amp;#39;re  accelerating their renewables pipeline and focusing on that portion of  the company more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, onto positions and how I&amp;#39;d trade it;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If  you just want to buy and hold in an account for the extreme long-term  -&amp;gt; buy shares and hold, I think this is going to heavily outperform  the S&amp;amp;P 500 into the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If  you want to get some of the spicy synthetic leverage gains with me  -&amp;gt; Jan 20 2023 80c&amp;#39;s. They print if the stock goes up ~15% in the  next 2 years because IV is super low. I grabbed 10 at 12.10 at the start  of the week on the dip, but I think they&amp;#39;ll open 13.00+ tomorrow. Keep  in mind that you don&amp;#39;t need to hold till expiry, I&amp;#39;ll probably liquidate  these after a year because I want the tax benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all from me today! This is my first DD post ever, so if you&amp;#39;ve got any suggestions/questions feel free to fire away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another day, another EV play. TSLA and NIO are both examples of EV companies that have capitalized on the gains resulting from being early to the party for electric cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awesome. But there is a whole other dimension to the automobile industry other than cars that HAS NOT been electrified yet, and that this company has a first-mover advantage on (just like NIO and TSLA did): &lt;strong&gt;The medium-heavy duty vehicles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I present you with an opportunity to be early to this party featuring the sleeping giant that is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;LION ELECTRIC ($NGA)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is currently trading under the SPAC ticker $NGA with a merger completion set for the end of Q1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That‚Äôs right, by buying 1 share of $NGA right now, you are effectively buying 1 share of Lion Electric. For anyone who wants to better understand SPACs, I highly recommend a quick search on Investopedia.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this post by saying that &lt;a href=&quot;https://thelionelectric.com/en&quot;&gt;Lion Electric&lt;/a&gt; has been working on their vehicles, battery technology, and charging grids since 2010 and ALREADY HAS VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. So no, they are not some shambolic ponzi scheme of an EV company (looking at you NKLA). In fact, it literally has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/largest-zero-emission-school-bus-fleet-in-north-america-bolstered-by-10-bus-delivery-from-lion-electric-301194935.html#:%7E:text=The%20Lion%20Electric%20Co.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;text=With%20these%20new%20buses%2C%20Twin,school%20buses%20in%20its%20fleet.&quot;&gt;largest fleet of electified school buses&lt;/a&gt; on the road in North America as we speak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.thelionelectric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investor-Presentation_20203011.pdf&quot;&gt;Here is the link to their investor presentation where they are already forecasting a positive EBITDA by the end of 2021. Highly recommend skimming over it, but I will highlight the main points later on in the post for yall anyways.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;So why haven&amp;#39;t I heard about this &amp;quot;Lion Electric&amp;quot; company?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple answer: it&amp;#39;s a Canadian company located in Quebec. No company outside of America or China can be of interest right? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RIGHT????&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Well, the EV credits and subsidies in Quebec are great, but other than that you are right. The good thing is that it ain&amp;#39;t gonna be Canadian-based much longer. Lion is going to reveal its new U.S. manufacturing facility any day now, rumored to be in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-lion-electric-co-to-deliver-michigans-first-11-electric-school-buses-as-part-of-the-volkswagen-mitigation-settlement-300917333.html&quot;&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; where it delivered the state&amp;#39;s first ever 100% electric school buses. Lion Electric, in fact, are already &lt;a href=&quot;https://michigan-company.com/co/the-lion-electric-co-usa-inc&quot;&gt;registered as a business&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan. Oh, and it just so happens that the rumored factory location is right in between two Amazon factories, and is not a mere coincidence (see more below on why this is pertinent). Anyhow, their future clearly lies in the United States, and they are uplisting as LEV on the NYSE when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005149/en/Northern-Genesis-Acquisition-Corp.-Announces-Filing-by-The-Lion-Electric-Company-of-a-Preliminary-Registration-Statement-on-SEC-Form-F-4-in-Connection-With-Their-Proposed-Business-Combination&quot;&gt;merger&lt;/a&gt; with NGA closes in March, as per the CEO. Seriously, look at how many job listings are posted across America by Lion Electric by clicking &lt;a href=&quot;https://emploislion.com/en/jobs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, why should I care?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because Jeff Bezos and Joe Biden care.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News silently broke last week that &lt;strong&gt;AMAZON&lt;/strong&gt; has come to an agreement to purchase up to 500 of Lions class-6 and class-8 delivery trucks per year from 2021-2025 (or up to 2500 over 5 years). Emphasis on &amp;#39;silently&amp;#39; because this company, unlike many, lets their results do the talking rather than a slimy PR team. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that Amazon has the option to purchase at least &lt;strong&gt;2500 trucks per year (conservative number), or 1.1b worth&lt;/strong&gt; for the five years following 2025, with a possibility of acquiring up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stnonline.com/news/school-bus-production-to-benefit-from-amazon-agreement-lion-electric/&quot;&gt;15.8% of the company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yup. Amazon are in bed with Lion Electric, and you should be too.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, before anyone asks, the Tesla semi-truck serves entirely different purposes. No point in comparing apples to oranges. Tesla&amp;#39;s truck is specialized for a single purpose: long distance delivery from warehouse to retail. &lt;strong&gt;The Lion-8 and Lion-6 delivery trucks are much more versatile, will be used by Amazon to deliver between Amazon&amp;#39;s facilities, and most importantly they are ready for MASS SCALE PRODUCTION&lt;/strong&gt;. So, no, they are not competing against the Tesla semi and will fill different voids in the market. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/nJiXzp8&quot;&gt;See here how diversified their truck lineup really is.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;And what about Joe Biden?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleepy Joe and his Clean Energy Plan have vowed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/11/14/what-bidens-environmental-plans-mean-for-electric-vehicles-syndication/&quot;&gt;electrify 500,000 school buses&lt;/a&gt; over the next 4 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NO COMPANY better positioned to take a huge piece of that pie than Lion Electric. If that seems like a stretch to you, consider this: the CEO of Lion, Marc Bedard, will be speaking at a virtual event on the future of E-mobility this Wednesday (Jan 13), &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.demio.com/ref/vFksZ11nZGvHsaxG&quot;&gt;where the Co-chair of Biden&amp;#39;s Infrastructure Committee will be in attendance&lt;/a&gt;. Their client from Twin Rivers Unified School District went as far as labelling Lion&amp;#39;s electric buses as the &lt;strong&gt;[Rolls Royce and Tesla of school buses]&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StpnGrItO4E&amp;amp;t=45s&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StpnGrItO4E&amp;amp;t=45s&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm sure many of you will be aware of the merger completed today with Proterra, another electric bus manufacturer. Awesome right? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820630/000121390021001584/ea133141ex99-2_arclight.htm?fbclid=IwAR0X17En3iZX-fZhuNAneJG2lDvOX_pT-OcKlXVbKWmnAMFtuNbUsrqA4M0&quot;&gt;A real shame that, in their investors presentation, they did not compare their revenue projections to Lion&amp;#39;s past the year 2021, as they would&amp;#39;ve admitted to being second best.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proterra are also exclusively a bus play, while Lion expects nearly 90% of its revenue by 2024 to be from trucks. In fact, Lion&amp;#39;s revenue from their trucks ALONE in 2024 is projected to trump Proterra&amp;#39;s entire revenue in 2025.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, none of these companies have anywhere near the capacity to electrify 25% of the American school bus fleet by themselves in 4 years. So I assure you that Lion will be providing buses to Biden over the next 4 years, as will Proterra probably, since there are only 3 players that are READY in the industry to be in on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why should I be buying NOW?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because today may very well be the last chance to get in $NGA under 30$.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Cramer is inviting Marc (the CEO) onto &lt;strong&gt;Mad Money&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/ucl54g5avaa61.jpg&quot;&gt;TODAY most likely&lt;/a&gt; after it was initially scheduled last week, but the events in Washington forced a postponement. A blessing in disguise for everyone really, and a final chance to get in before this it takes off. NGA is still trading at a measly 1B valuation, with Amazon ALONE forecasted to purchase more than 1b worth of trucks per year come 2025. Marc is going to pump Lion to the best of abilities on Mad Money, and Cramer is going to eat all of it up, as this company is the real deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I know $NGA will get pumped so hard?&lt;/strong&gt; The CEO of Lion featured on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fm93.com/audio/361623/marc-bedard-pdg-de-lion-amazon-dispose-a-acheter-des-camions-du-producteur-quebecois?fbclid=IwAR1N4Kr0eX-nLjr2-VThUCUVcGIwRlL0ZpC7Abpic7fQY7In4BbJqz7Y7jE&quot;&gt;local news podcast&lt;/a&gt; last week and boasted about the Amazon deal as well as their advantage over competition in electrifying buses and trucks, &lt;strong&gt;comparing Lion to Tesla in the process&lt;/strong&gt;. Unfortunately, he said all of this in French, which I&amp;#39;m sure quite a few of you won&amp;#39;t understand. But once he regurgitates it all in English to Jim Cramer, the significant deal with Amazon and its similarities to Tesla in its infancy will wreak havoc in the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh yeah, and, by the way, the last time Cramer hosted a CEO from an up and coming EV merger acquisition (CIIC), that stock went from 21$-37$ in the two following trading sessions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;But why should I pick Lion Electric over all the other EV stocks that get spammed in here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because Lion Electric offers much more than just prototypes, ideas, and false hopes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ There are currently 7 different &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/L1cu6oS&quot;&gt;trucks and buses&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;available for purchase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ They already have &lt;strong&gt;300+ vehicles on the road&lt;/strong&gt; today with over 
  6mil miles between them &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ Multi-year deal agreement for &lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt; to purchase up to 
  2500 vehicles (Lion6 and Lion8) 2021-2025, with even bigger 
  and more lucrative opportunities afterwards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ &lt;strong&gt;CN (huge Canadian transporter)&lt;/strong&gt; recently Purchased 50 
  trucks - with a chance to increase size of order later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ &lt;strong&gt;Government-backed&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/xoJ9Kze&quot;&gt;Canada&amp;#39;s prime minister Justin 
  Trudeau supports the company&lt;/a&gt;, 
  while nationalized companies like Hydro Quebec and SAQ have 
  purchase agreements in place that provide a strong foundation 
  for Lion&amp;#39;s business&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ &lt;strong&gt;Produce their own batteries:&lt;/strong&gt; on top of already having suppliers for their batteries, Lion is 
  building a facility to and immunize themselves against potential shortages as they upscale 
  production, set to be completed in 2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ &lt;strong&gt;V2G technology&lt;/strong&gt; ready for the batteries, and implemented 
  into their school buses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ Deals with &lt;strong&gt;BMW, ChargePoint, Nuvve, and Romeo Power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/dFFTczt&quot;&gt;8 NEW vehicles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to be produced between 2021-2022 
  including: Ambulance, bucket truck, Class 5 and Class 7 trucks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/wFbrle5&quot;&gt;USA expansion&lt;/a&gt; completed by 
  2022, will give them a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Made in America&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; image&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ NKLA &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; had to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/23/tech/nikola-garbage-truck-%20%0A%20%20canceled/index.html&quot;&gt;scrap their deal on the table with Republic Services&lt;/a&gt; to 
  provide them with up to &lt;strong&gt;5000 garbage disposal trucks&lt;/strong&gt; just a 
  few weeks ago. Who could possibly fill the void and has a ZERO EMISSION
  refuse truck ready for purchase? Lion Electric, that&amp;#39;s 
  who. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsNQwjXDP4&quot;&gt;See the truck in action here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;How about their financials??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/uLp1pf3&quot;&gt;Well, here are their financials and revenue projections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ Projected revenue of &lt;strong&gt;3.6 billion $&lt;/strong&gt; by 2024&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ &lt;strong&gt;Cash flow positive&lt;/strong&gt; in 2023&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ &lt;strong&gt;EBITDA positive by end of 2021&lt;/strong&gt;, with EBITDA growth of 
  approximately 16% YOY afterwards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬∑ Cost reduction of 50% by 2024 &lt;strong&gt;(better profit margins)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undervalued EV company tied to Amazon that has product labelled as the &amp;quot;Tesla of school buses&amp;quot;. CEO will appear on Mad Money today most likely, and $NGA will fly past 30$. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POSITIONS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/L4gr51J&quot;&gt;Here.&lt;/a&gt; 700 $NGA shares and 1k warrants, with an extra 500 shares in a separate account. Would not recommend options on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
