Your political affiliation is a reflection of your core values, and your core values IS the content of your character; and isn&amp;#39;t the content of your character the only reasonable thing that is up for judgement? Not only that, who you decide to vote for has REAL implications on the rest of us, should that person be elected into power. In the course of your political expression, people are allowed to reassess their friendship / relationship with you when they realize your core values are not compatible with theirs. In fact, it&amp;#39;s GOOD that people are choosing to end friendships / relationships rather than stew in a passive-aggressive, resentful dynamic with people whom they no longer like.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are my reasons for believing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One - Instagram is losing its niche&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram had a successful niche as a photo-sharing platform, and that is still ultimately what most creators and users use it for. Users use it because they want to see photos and engage with them. However, Instagram is now moving to attempt to compete with YouTube and TikTok, which will ultimately fail because those platforms are already occupying their respective niches, and doing a good job at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two - Instagram isn&amp;#39;t showing people what they want to see&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that most casual users of Instagram are like myself - we follow pages that we want to use, which usually includes our friends and pages of interest that we are interested in. Instagram&amp;#39;s attempt to push people to look at pages that they don&amp;#39;t even follow at the expense of pages that they do is driving users away and lowering users&amp;#39; interest in the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I think that Instagram will eventually die out, and pretty soon at that.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a monstrous practice, that creates a lot more pollution due to trans-oceanic transportation and takes capital out of a nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end product is cheaper to manufacture so the corporation can increase its profits, and the costs are externalized: someone else will have to clean the oceans in the future, and someone else misses out on a job that&amp;#39;s outsourced to another nation. Net gain for the corporation, net loss for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need taxes in place so that this practice is a net loss for the corporation. It&amp;#39;s ruining the country and the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also undercover cops, vans, cruisers being used for routine traffic enforcement seem blatantly unconstitutional because they amount to a search of the public without warrant or probable cause. Crime can happen anywhere, behind closed doors or on the streets and nothing is preventing police from enforcing traffic laws in plainly marked vehicles. Using unmarked vehicles is the same thing as policing an area without a warrant to search &amp;#39;looking for probable cause&amp;#39;. The warrant is already there, police have some function to protect the public, but hiding that warrant, which is the police presence, goes beyond legal limits placed on government by the bill of rights. Police in an area already amounts to a search, you cant hide the fact you are there and still call yourself law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for undercover police infiltrating freely associated groups, as they have no probable cause and the state cannot sanction the search of a group of people. People also cannot &amp;#39;surrender&amp;#39; that right or any other right, depending on which platform is used. I believe that act is also unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;

Equal pay in other stuff is reasonable like doing the same office job. But in the context of sports, I dont see equal pay in women&amp;#39;s football being realistic in the current women&amp;#39;s market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my general knowledge of sports. Salary for players are usually determined by the total revenue of the league divided between the player&amp;#39;s salary, the owners, and the league&amp;#39;s administration. As an example, the NFL distributes is revenue by giving 49% to the profits for player&amp;#39;s salary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I believe the real reason women don&amp;#39;t get equally paid in football is mainly due to the lack of revenue in women&amp;#39;s soccer. The best women&amp;#39;s soccer player wants to be paid the same as Messi or ronaldo. But the question is do they generate as much money as those two soccer giants? I believe the lack of revenue generated in women&amp;#39;s football leagues will limit their salaries. They need more demand where people want to pay just as much as mens league to watch and of course have the same amount of people willing to pay the same price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the whole movement seems weak because by paying the same wage as men they are bankrupting their own league. Where is the money coming from? Because they don&amp;#39;t generate enough revenue for equal pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, women&amp;#39;s tennis generates high revenue. There is a reason they are the highest paid female athletes. They bring in fans and money. Not quite equal to the male tennis wage, but the gap is much smaller compared to other sports. Hence, revenue generated = higher salaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this entire movement was based on unfair percentage split then I am supporting them. But the issue is the absolute revenue is just so low compared to men. Sports is essentially entertainment. You get paid by the demand of people wanting to spend to watch you. Women&amp;#39;s football league just doesn&amp;#39;t have the demand comparable to the men&amp;#39;s league. They should focus on increasing that demand and revenue rather than asking for something that is not even available. Cause there is not enough money available to pay all the women football players the same as men.&lt;/p&gt;

However I do not like that an officer with no training gets to decide to actually charge you with the crime, I believe at most a driver should be taken to the drunk tank and then released (WITH vehicle) and if the blood tests come back negative, then they can charge them and set up a court date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw this because years ago I was pulled over and apparently failed a field sobriety test. I was not on anything, my car was impounded for 30 days, and I had to miss work sometimes due to lack of ride, as well as going to multiple court dates because they kept scheduling them before they had the results, so I would wait all day in court only to be called up and rescheduled because they don&amp;#39;t have the blood work back. Finally I go and they say &amp;quot;oh your blood work was negative, you&amp;#39;re free to leave&amp;quot; but of course no refund for paying close to $2000 to get my car out of impound or anything. I&amp;#39;m not sure what should be the exact solution to this, but I do know that something needs to change&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was watching a YouTube video of a European women showing how to do a Nordic/Viking style braid. She braided two cornrows (she called them cornrows but I think they were really Dutch braids) on both sides of her head, and then did a big braid on top, gathered all the braids together into a pony in the back. Some people were upset in the comments though, saying that she is appropriating black culture by doing these small Dutch braids, even though this hairstyle was done by vikings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example, I saw a tiktok of these white girls at a pool, and they all were wearing a silk scarf on their head. People in the comments were upset by this, and claimed they were appropriating black culture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just dont understand how a culture can own a certain style of braid or a certain way to tie a scarf to your head. If someone is wearing their hair like that, and they aren&amp;#39;t doing it to be racist, I dont see the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

He realized that he had had too much to drink, so he called a ride.  It was mid August and super hot outside, so while he was waiting on his ride he sat in in his truck and ran the A/C.  A police officer saw him and took him in for a DWI and he was convicted.  It effected his employment and schooling for the next couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never liked the guy much, but I always thought he got a raw deal. He was doing the right thing and got the same penalty as if he decided to drive home.  You should be able to sleep it off in your car without fear of consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard the argument that if the officer saw a drunk sitting in their car and just walked away from it, the person could start driving at any moment.  I argue that it would be just as easy to take the person home as it would be to take them to jail, and it doesnt ruin their life. The police could even take them to the jail to dry out for the night just to be sure, but there is no reason to suspend their license, fine, and imprison a person for simply sitting in their car with the keys in their possession, or even sitting in a running vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To head off the first argument I see coming, this doesn&amp;#39;t apply to a vehicle in a lane of traffic, obviously if you are passed out at a stop sign or something you deserve a DWI.&lt;/p&gt;

They are making 200 pounds of meth a week for 3 months.  (source: The show)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) The meth sells at $40 an ounce. (Source:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie keeps saying, &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s selling at 40 a pound&amp;quot;.  I see 3 possibilities for this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A.) He mean $40 a pound.  For all the risk they are taking to make Meth, that seems like too small of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B.) Me meant $40,000 a pound.  This sounds like astronomically too high.  How could Meth junkies ever afford their meth if 1 pound sells for 1 years minimum wage salary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C.) He mis-poke, and meant $40 an ounce.  This sounds most plausible to me, as it means they are making some decent money from their risk and Meth junkies can still afford to buy their meth.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.) There are 16 ounces in a pound. (Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;amp;q=ounces+in+a+pound&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.) They are working for 13 weeks.  (Source:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming ~31 days in a month, ~31 x 3 = ~93 days in 3 months.  ~93/7 = ~13 weeks in 3 months)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.)  Conclusion: The meth they make for Gus during the 3 months can sell for ~1.5 million dollars.  (Source:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$40 (per ounce) x 16 (ounces per pound) x 200 (pounds per week) x 13 (weeks in the job) = $1,664,000, or ~1.5 million dollars)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets get down to the problems here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gus is losing money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gus is paying 3 million dollars for these two guys to make product that he will sell for 1.5 million dollars.  That&amp;#39;s 1.5 million dollars down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walter and Jessie are bad at Math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie and Walter both come to the conclusion that Gus is making 93 million off their 3 month job.  Given all the information we have, they should have come to 1.5 million.  Jessie I could understand making a mistake somewhere in this math.  But Walter is supposed to be the smart guy.  How could he also make this mistake?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would change my view&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Show me a way to interpret the information in the show in such a way that the job is profitable for Gus while still being based in reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Explain why both Walter and Jessie made such bad math mistakes in their calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus points if you can do both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What wouldn&amp;#39;t change my view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was a mistake the show-writers made.&lt;/em&gt;  If this is the case I apologize since it means there isn&amp;#39;t really a view to be changed here.  However, I have hope that there is something I am missing that explains this mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edits/deltas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gus is doing this venture as a long term plan.  Once he has Walt&amp;#39;s formula, he can start making money again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The math at $40k a pound checks out for Walter and Jessie&amp;#39;s calculation if you assume 12 weeks instead of 13 weeks.  12 instead of 13 weeks seems like a simple enough mistake if you assume the 4 weeks per month as many people do.  $40k a pound for meth seems unrealistic to me, but at least that is a flaw in the world building rather than Walter or Jessie&amp;#39;s character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junkies buy in teenths (1/16 of an ounce), which makes selling Meth at $40k a pound more reasonable.  Also, $40k a pound checks out with how much money Walter and Jessie were making when they cooked in their RV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real Meth sells at about the $40k per pound value.  Looks like the show was actually being very realistic after all!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Its not like viv/vov people have been oppressed for hundreds of years like gay people. The sad thing is, is most people who share this an opinion with me get &amp;quot;canceled&amp;quot; because criticizing lgbt is some godforsaken sin now a days.

You are their parent and it is your responsibility to raise them. If you don&amp;#39;t want your kids to see or hear a programming then that should be on you. When I hear a song on the radio with 50 different little distorted parts it makes me laugh. If it&amp;#39;s so inappropriate why is it on a channel meant for all audiences? If it&amp;#39;s so inappropriate why let your child listen to begin with? Do you really think the swear words are the only controversial thing in these songs? Why not simply parent your child and make sure they aren&amp;#39;t consuming content you don&amp;#39;t see fit for your child?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also ruins songs and programs for us adults. There have been parts that are so heavily censored that the joke is basically how censored it is cause you&amp;#39;ll never hear the actual words. You just hear bleep bleep bleeeep bleep bleep bleep and some bleep bleep and then everyone around the character is just shocked and I&amp;#39;m just pissed. Why can I see a character get brutally killed in the most horrific way possible but not hear fuck? Why can I watch a character get sexually assaulted or even raped but as long as I don&amp;#39;t see a dick or a nipple then I&amp;#39;m good? I can watch mass genocide or listen to hate speech but can&amp;#39;t hear cunt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dumbest part of all of this is 99% of us know exactly what is being censored. It doesn&amp;#39;t actually work as censoring if your mind fills in the blanks. Sure if the screen went completely black whenever nudity or sexual content came on or you censored the whole sentence instead of just the &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; word then yeah it&amp;#39;d work but we don&amp;#39;t do that. It feels like we simply do the level of censoring we do to make the 0.001% of the population who would be lose their shit happy but why the fuck do we care what they think? They aren&amp;#39;t watching the fucking shows! No way you are a stick up the butt prude and like watching South Park and rick and morty and you draw the line at nipples and fucks. Why do we pander to the extreme minority? We could uncensore every adult program and nothing would happen and everyone who watches these programs or listens to these songs would still listen and watch and the only mad ones would be people who don&amp;#39;t even consume that media&lt;/p&gt;

I dont mean treating people with respect or holding the door open, those are just traits of a decent human. What I mean is the man asking the woman out , having to plan the date, pay for it and any further other(since she will hold it againts him if he dosnt) and generally having to ,, woo her,, while she stays passive. The main reason for this post is a coment I read on one of the dating subs(looking trought the controversial section on them is a guilty pleasure when I&amp;#39;m bored). It was a woman comenthing how when a guy dosnt pay for the date he shows that he is cheap and lazy and yet saying that she never pays for a date. This really annoyed me because it really reminds me of ,, modern day femenist,,. I belive that if a woman want equality ( which everyone should want) then she must accept both the benefits and the responsibility that come with it. You cant just say well I reject the gender norms in this and this area since they hinder me but I want to keep them in this and this are since I benefit from them. If you want to be intellectually honest you either chose equality,  both the good and the bad, or choose old school. Meaning that you demand that the guys is the archetype of the old school gentleman, but you also have to be the archetype of the old school woman(staying in the house, cooking, cleaning and taking care of his sexual needs whenever he wants). Now there isnt anything wrong with either of the options( different tastes for different people) but anything in between and your just a hypocrite who wants to have their cake and eat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/SHLHkmWoYDU&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/SHLHkmWoYDU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America pretty much lost the Iraq war. Sure they got rid of Saddam, but they didnt subdue the militant Islamists and ex-Iraqi army militias at all. Once they left Isis had the strength to not only conquer large swathes of Iraq, but the middle east proper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America has 7x the population of Iraq and something like 10x the guns, plus a populace with a ludicrously high rate of firearm profficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add to that the radically different levels of desertion, and more importantly sabotage. You think fragging was bad in Nam, see what happens when you invade Texas lmfao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add to that the logistical nightmare that is protecting US infrastructure, literally 10s of millions of unguardable targets, and the whole thing starts looking unwinnable for the government very fucking fast.  US geography is also an extremely daunting challenge with regards to suppressing rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the foreign actor concern. Allies would put pressure on to stop the killing of civilians (which would be a necessary collateral outcome of fighting your own people). Enemies would gleefully support the rebels in any way they could as hard as they could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government would never fucking glass its own territory and people with nukes, its fucking ridiculous to suggest such a thing. Even conventional bombing would be asking to feed into desertion and further rebellion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to invade due to a rifle behind every blade of grass isnt just something for foreign armies to ponder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American citizens should be sickened by his words here, they are deeply unAmerican and downright terrifying to be coming from the top executive in the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus CMV:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden is straight up lying about the &amp;#39;types of weapons&amp;#39; claim, you could absolutely own cannons as a private citizen. Privateers used them all the time and 2A allowed for their legal ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tl:dr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2A practically ensures the US populace a reasonable if not favored chance against their own government. Not many countries can say that, and none of them have a military as daunting as the yanks. Biden&amp;#39;s cute little comment was pure unadulterated bluff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 1:&lt;/strong&gt; gee whiz its hard to run so many arguments at once. I should have done this with access to my pc instead of just my shitty phone with a cracked screen. I apologise to anybody left waiting, im trying to answer as quickly as possible, im literally sweating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2:&lt;/strong&gt; use of the Iraq war as example was just that. Whether that war counted as victory or defeat is not all that relevant to my opinion here, my point was just that the insurgent population was never subdued despite the overwhelming technological advantage wielded by the US military. The Taliban or viet kong might have been better to go with, but thats not exactly comparable because they are militaries themselves at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 3:&lt;/strong&gt; I will add one argument. The top US military brass have said on many occassions that they are beholden to the constitution first and foremost. I tend to take them at their word, they generally seem like very principled and proud individuals willing to do anything necessary to uphold their oath. That means the President cant just decide to glass entire cities or States that contain innocent civilians in amongst an insurgency or guerilla network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 4:&lt;/strong&gt; I think many here are failing to appreciate the ticking clock the government would be put under during a popular uprising, especially if many people stopped working and paying taxes. The US military is insanely expensive, an insurgency is very cheap. As the Taliban say: &amp;#39;you have the watches, we have the time&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

Correcting people doing an economics PhD on &amp;quot;you can&amp;#39;t say free because nothing is free&amp;quot;. A physicist on the usage of &amp;quot;weight&amp;quot;, and so on.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My view is that we should strive, in the context of a normal conversation or discussion, to be understandable by the lay public&lt;/strong&gt;, as experts in their fields should strive for us to understand. But to just &amp;quot;nitpick&amp;quot; on the fact that an expert or trained professional uses a more understandable, not perfectly accurate term, is pointless. The chances they know what they are saying are high, and that they know more than whoever is commenting even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think there is a point in such a context to do this? As it&amp;#39;s something I hear almost daily about many fields and with many colleagues from various backgrounds complaining about this, I figured I should ask myself if maybe it actually could be useful.

&lt;p&gt;First of all, if a person has the money to legally pay for a service (movies, animes, games etc) and they don&amp;#39;t do it because they think entertainment should be free, yes, then piracy can&amp;#39;t be justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also i think pirating services such as games that are made by indie companies and are available to buy for a cheap price, also can&amp;#39;t be justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, let me tell you my reasons :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reston number one: some people are poor. I have heard people say &amp;quot; WeLl iF yOu ArE pOor ThAT doEsNt jUStify sTeAling&amp;quot;, and i consider that bullshit cause, being really poor can also justify stealing in some conditions, if a homeless child steals one apple to steal alive, that isn&amp;#39;t wrong, human life values a lot more than an apple, if a person steals a loaf of bread to feed his family, it&amp;#39;s not something wrong, because again, human life values a lot more than a loaf of bread. So yes, i think stealing can be justified if the person they&amp;#39;re stealing from isn&amp;#39;t poor himself, also don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, i don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a good thing to steal but if someone&amp;#39;s life depends on it, it can be justified. And for piracy, of course someone&amp;#39;s life doesn&amp;#39;t depend on watching movies, but i think if a poor person pirates some movie, it can lead to that person support the industry when he&amp;#39;s able to, that can also lead to free marketing some people are not able to pay for entertainment and i think it&amp;#39;s OK to pirate as long as it&amp;#39;s not possible to pay, of course as long as they choose to pay when they have the ability to. And also I&amp;#39;ve heard people say &amp;quot; eNtertAinMEnt iS a LuXurY&amp;quot;, and my answer to that is, what does a rich kid do to deserve to have that luxury that a poor broke kid doesn&amp;#39;t? The answer is, nothing, it just depended on their luck. So yes i think pirating can be justified as long as the person pays for it when they can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2- legally paying for entertainment doesn&amp;#39;t always support the creators. Half the time that you buy something, the money doesn&amp;#39;t actually really go to the actual creators, usually the big company receives the money and not the actual creators. And that happens a lot especially in the Anime/manga industry. The industry has been growing, and that growth leads to more money for the creators, so why are animators still underpaid af? I think when a big company doesn&amp;#39;t pay their employees enough, they deserve their products pirated, at least until they decide to change&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3- it may be impossible to pay for entertainment. You might be confused, this is more of a personal reason but it&amp;#39;s literally impossible for people such as me to pay for entertainment legally. So let me explain, i live in Iran, and in Iran, international banking doesn&amp;#39;t exist, it&amp;#39;s not possible for an iranian person to pay for any service that&amp;#39;s outside of iran, and there&amp;#39;s no service that legally sells entertainment products like movies and animes, even the big streaming services pirate their stuff, so yeah it&amp;#39;s impossible for me to pay for something like Netflix. Also most of the entertainment services have banned iran, so doesn&amp;#39;t that mean they don&amp;#39;t want our money? And also it is possible to buy games, but they are so expensive that it&amp;#39;s possible to pay the rent with the money &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m going to say, i might be a bit biased, keep in mind that these are my opinions and i don&amp;#39;t count them as objective facts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic judgments, superficial lies, and echo chambers of misinformation have amplified our negativity, as well as distracted many Americans and other members of industrial societies from real crises like Climate Change, World Hunger, Global Peace, or Social Justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean is, people online are nasty &amp;amp; carry that nastiness into real life. If you aren&amp;#39;t pretty, funny, or witty, no one values you in the digital world &amp;amp; the culture of people who learn this way likewise treat you cruelly in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more scary, actual life-or-death needs are tragically ignored by bad info on FaceBook, InstaGram, Twitter, or even Reddit etc. We see vaccine lies lead to people dying ; we also see violent white supremacists organize domestic terror ; and we see junk science like alternate &amp;quot;climate&amp;quot; hypotheses spread as though they&amp;#39;re scientific theories.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not saying it ‘should’ be socially acceptable, I’m saying that I believe it is currently (subconsciously) accepted, and it shouldn’t be. I’m asking you to convince me that it is not socially accepted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before anyone misinterprets this, this does not mean that other races and nationalities do not face racism and discrimination. I know that they face it much worse than whites and Americans, and I understand systematic racism and white privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is that if you were to make a negative remark about a white person, it is not socially frowned upon. And that same remark made by a white person towards any person who isn’t white would have you labeled a racist. I’ll give an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White person recommends going to a bar that is predominantly white. Response is “I don’t really want to be around that many white people haha”. Socially acceptable, even possibly a joke. No outrage. If it’s reversed and the comment is “I don’t really want to be around that many black people haha”. You are a racist, and a comment like that would destroy relationships. Replace black with literally any other race, and the comment is equally as racist, but made towards a white it’s like whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen the term “wypipo” for white people. No one says it’s racist, it just is what it is. If white people had a nickname for black people that black people did not like, you would be shunned for using it. Something like “they don’t like being called that, so stop”. But if white people don’t like being called wypipo? Doesn’t seem like it matters…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example about Americans. (Living as an American in another country has made me realise this over and over again, it never ends). A comment overheard in public “Americans are so annoying”. Everyone supports it (except for Americans of course), but the response is not “Wow that was actually racist”. Everyone openly agrees, it’s socially acceptable. Even if they don’t agree, you aren’t shunned for it. Same comment but replace Americans with literally any other nationality. “Japanese people are so annoying”, heads would turn and you’d be labeled a racist instantly, and rightfully so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: previous examples are xenophobic , not racist, but same idea of the discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been afraid to discuss this sentiment among peers, so before you change my view, can you please also let me know if I’m way out of line, or if it has some merit of truth, but the discussion itself may not even be socially acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: also to be clear, I don’t think that people are ‘intentionally’ accepting of this, it seems like more of a subconscious thing, not realising that there is anything wrong with being said&lt;/p&gt;

While I can understand this reasoning for many of the existing cultures that had their artifacts taken in recent memory, my primary contention with this for Egypt specifically is that they&amp;#39;re incredibly old. The Egyptians that created these artifacts and all their ancestors are long dead, and the people and government that currently live in Egypt are just the conquerors of the conquerors of the conquerors of the people who did create this artifacts. The British and others took these artifacts from the people who took them from the people who took them from the people who lived there thousands of years ago, their claim doesn&amp;#39;t really seem any less reasonable than those of the current Egyptian people or government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I don&amp;#39;t really believe these artifacts should sit concentrated at a few European museums either, I believe when it comes to things this old they should be considered to be part of our shared heritage as a species and should be equally distributed around the world to all stable countries that could reasonable house them (I could make another argument about how Egypt is not the best place for these artifacts on the basis of the instability of the government alone), so that as many people as possible could see them.&lt;/p&gt;

And any political viewpoint will look insane when taken to its logical extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At it&amp;#39;s most basic form, a libertarian believes that a person or group of people in government are not capable of knowing what&amp;#39;s best for me as an individual, or you as an individual. This is at it&amp;#39;s worse at the federal level, and gets slightly better as government gets more local.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a libertarian wants to reduce the power of government to &lt;strong&gt;only what&amp;#39;s necessary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is where individual libertarians would have discussions and debate, around what is necessary and what is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a libertarian could absolutely be for universal healthcare. They might compare what we pay right now on average to the NHS, and see that we actually pay more than they do. Then there could be a discussion that the free market isn&amp;#39;t working right with healthcare because people don&amp;#39;t know what they will pay for the service, and the service is often times non-optional. Thus, it is necessary for the government to fund healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think where leftists and libertarians most often disagree is actually around the framing of the discussion. If the subject is social safety nets for example, the leftist will enter the conversation on the assumption that government is the one and only option for providing help to those that need it. The libertarian does not enter the conversation with this assumption. So the conversation is doomed from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They aren&amp;#39;t disagreeing about helping people, they are disagreeing about the method of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my view is that libertarianism isn&amp;#39;t any more or less crazy than conservatism or liberalism. Both of the latter philosophies wish to use the government to enforce their views, while libertarianism does not. I don&amp;#39;t find that to be an unreasonable political philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

That said, I have a pretty privileged background and none of these issues have impacted my life directly, so I will definitely have pretty big gaps in my understanding. I have made what I think is an honest effort to understand both sides of this debate (which seems to have been set off by a couple recent reddit/twitter posts and the Oli London video), and I feel like I&amp;#39;m reaching a completely different conclusion to the people close to me (and online) that I tend to agree with, so I want to challenge my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general I am 100% fine with people being cisgender, transgender, non-binary, gender-fluid, transsexual, or whatever else as long as they are doing it in good faith.* Not everybody thinks this way, obviously, so we have this big cultural change underway as people come to grips with gender identity.  Big cultural shifts tend to create really challenging social/cultural knock-on effects. In my mind, this question about racial identity and being transracial is one of them. I don&amp;#39;t think there are easy answers for a lot of these questions, but I think we owe it to eachother to listen, explore, communicate, and compromise. The conversations that I&amp;#39;ve seen so far on the topic of racial identity are far from honest, with arguments like: &amp;quot;Gender dysphoria is a part of psychology [and racial dysphoria isn&amp;#39;t]&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called_it/h3daui1?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3&quot;&gt;0&lt;/a&gt; (Gender dysphoria wasn&amp;#39;t either, 50 years ago); &amp;quot;Culture and heritage however is lived through communities. It can be  appropriated and abused. A white British person claiming to be  trans-Korean diminishes the experiences and burdens of actual Korean people and communities.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called_it/h3dc4wt?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; (Gender has a massive cultural component), &amp;quot;Race and Ethnicity is Rooted in Ancestry… You Can’t Just Pick and Choose&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/verve-up/transracial-is-not-the-new-transgender-why-race-and-gender-are-not-synonymous-b2c688ef0fae&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; (sounds a lot like the &amp;#39;gender is rooted in biology&amp;#39; argument to me) and &amp;quot;We also think that, as a result of this asymmetry, transgender identities deserve social uptake and so-called “transracial”  identifications as Black almost always do not. (We leave space for  unique circumstances in which someone who has deeply invested in a Black community and been forthcoming about their racial history is nevertheless accepted within that community as Black.)&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bostonreview.net/race-philosophy-religion-gender-sexuality/robin-dembroff-dee-payton-why-we-shouldnt-compare&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/16/transracial-definition-destructive-rachel-dolezal-spokane-naacp&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; (there&amp;#39;s obviously massive differences, but this argument isn&amp;#39;t fundamentally different to arguing that trans women aren&amp;#39;t women because they haven&amp;#39;t grown up having periods, experiencing sexism, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting aside (for now) the existing use of &amp;#39;transracial&amp;#39; used in the context of adopted children raised outside of their biological parents&amp;#39; ethnic/racial cultures, I think that being transracial is similar in a lot of ways to being transgender or transexual, and I don&amp;#39;t see how that de-legitimizes either of those things. I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of fear on the left that this comparison makes the transgender/transsexual struggle look somehow ridiculous or absurd by association &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called_it/&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; and I guess I can see why people might think that, but it feels like either an unhelpful gut reaction, or (being a bit pessimistic) an overly political/strategic reaction which looks a lot like &lt;a href=&quot;https://thomasnastcartoons.com/2015/01/06/throwing-down-the-ladder-by-which-they-rose-23-july-1870/&quot;&gt;throwing the ladder down&lt;/a&gt;. Every new cultural idea is uncomfortable at first, but we don&amp;#39;t know if it has any merit if we don&amp;#39;t explore it in good faith. I think it&amp;#39;s also a missed opportunity to better understand trans/identity in general&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the other (original) definition of transracial -- adopted children raised outside their biological parents&amp;#39; culture/race -- I think it&amp;#39;s a really interesting bridge between transsexual identity politics and transracial (the other/new definition) identity politics, because there are hundreds of thousands of cases of transracial adoption, and I&amp;#39;m sure we could learn a lot about culture and identity if we asked them about it.  I expect some of these children experience very real, very complicated dysphoria [citation needed, obviously].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if the likes of Rachel Dolezal, Oli London, Ja Du, Ekundayo, etc are charlatans or people in genuine turmoil deserving of, if not our sympathy, at least our patience. What I do know is that this kind of tectonic cultural shift has happened enough times throughout history that I think I want to hedge my bets and at least be kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Quick aside:  I don&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;as long as it isn&amp;#39;t hurting anyone&amp;quot; because I&amp;#39;ve observed that change hurts, and a lot of people are experiencing real pain caused by this big cultural shift in favor of trans rights and that&amp;#39;s unavoidable. However, I think there will always be charlatans out there who take advantage of the opportunity that any big disruption creates, so that&amp;#39;s why I say &amp;#39;in good faith&amp;#39;. You can pick your example of this, from people &amp;#39;playing the race card&amp;#39; to children setting their screen names to &amp;#39;Connecting...&amp;#39; to get out of zoom/skype classes during a pandemic.

&lt;p&gt;Is there a meaningful difference between &amp;quot;permanent&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;indefinite&amp;quot;? &lt;/p&gt;

Politicians are throwing numbers around left and right. After the debate is over you have another 30-45 minutes of programming dedicated to fact-checking what they said, again without any sources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a political debate, politicians should be allowed to prepare a presentation for each of the big questions that are released beforehand. These should be backed up by easily accessible sources, so that the viewers can verify the claims if they want to, while they are watching the debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it goes into the shorter rapid-fire debates between two candidates this obviously isn&amp;#39;t feasible. Instead, I feel like the respective campaigns should be forced to put out a statement afterward citing sources for as many of the points their candidate made as is possible. If they said something that can&amp;#39;t be backed up, then they issue an apology and a clarification. This would preferably be done at the next debate or some other televised event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that this is far from perfect and that it&amp;#39;s possible to find sources supporting most opinions. However, politicians have been known to just spout random &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; that are later proven false. I think this would go a small way to deter this type of behavior, without decreasing the viewability or essence of a political debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT… I do strongly believe that the connection between how you feel (your energy, outlook, emotions, cognition, decision making abilities) is not brought to the forefront of solving issues like depression, unproductiveness, and aggression like it should. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody is willing to acknowledge that diet and sleep have profound effects on health but very few seem to actually realise it and apply it to themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often than not I feel as though that ‘tiring job’ or ‘draining relationship’ is more a result of a poor diet and sleep regime than it is actual social interactions having an effect. No, you are not tired on Saturday because you ‘just finished an exhausting work week’, you are tired because you eat and sleep like shit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, hormones can be influenced by social interactions, but over a long period of time I see their effects as minimal in comparison to a good regime. (I’m saying this to attribute more of the effect to diet and sleep, I’m not saying that severe events like a loved one’s passing can’t sometimes overpower the effects of diet and sleep). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind you, I’m in the prime of my life physically and I don’t expect the entire population to have my level of energy or sharpness so I realise my bias, but I don’t think people without prexisting conditions are doomed to things like midday lethargy and morning grogginess. On a good day of eating and sleeping I have energy throughout and feel cognitively present at all times, regardless of my social context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, also, what is with normalising things like lethargy, headaches, and brain fog?? I constantly see people accept things like post-meal lethargy as concrete and unchangeable. People literally plan their days around when they’ll be lethargic instead of actually trying to fix the problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me started on the neurodepressive effects of eating and sleeping like garbage. Not saying all cases of depression can be solved with those two things alone, but they can certainly be greatly ameliorated by them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realisation translates into action. 2/3rds of the American popular is overweight, if that doesn’t show that this isn’t an unpopular sentiment I don’t know what does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think? Kick me down a peg I’ve been lurking pubmed and NCBI for too long. &lt;/p&gt;

They&amp;#39;re actually pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reading sections of the SAT/ACT perhaps leave the most to be desired. Being able to parse text from 300 years ago is to a large degree a function of having experience reading text from 300 years ago. So, when you get a reading passage like that, it&amp;#39;s testing if you read older books a lot. There&amp;#39;s also the matter of questions that start to venture into a certain bit of subjectivity. &amp;quot;Choose the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; answer&amp;quot; they say, and I&amp;#39;ve come upon times where I didn&amp;#39;t entirely agree with what they thought was the &amp;#39;best answer&amp;#39;. This is why I personally would be able to get a perfect score on math sections time and time again, but might get 1 or 2 wrong in the reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grammar sections are better. Gone are the old &amp;#39;this is to that and that is to...&amp;#39; questions, which tested raw vocabulary, and instead it&amp;#39;s mostly testing to see if you understand English. Yes, language evolves, but every needs to learn how to write and speak well in the formal standard of our times, as a practical thing. We want to prepare people to go into job interviews and the like and be able to be well-spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The math sections really didn&amp;#39;t need that many changes, as they are entirely solid. They do exactly what they should: Take material from school, and give it a little bit of a twist that tests a deeper understanding. Excellent. This simultaneously tests a bit of what you learned, and how well you can think. I might give a certain amount of more difficult questions on the SAT, but overall I think it&amp;#39;s a very good evaluation tool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the proof of that is that you can&amp;#39;t really &amp;#39;crack the code&amp;#39; - I&amp;#39;ve had parents in the past who unfortunately wanted me to arrive with some sort of secret formula to a high score, and the reality is that there isn&amp;#39;t one, because the test is well designed. The secret to a better score is &amp;quot;learn the material, and beyond that have a high IQ&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other tests are different, but in a proper way. The GRE kind of abandons the idea of testing your high school learning, because it knows you just spent 4 years in college in who knows what major. Better to test you in ways that don&amp;#39;t require a lot of rote math knowledge, but more reasoning skills that are universal - and that&amp;#39;s exactly what it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LSAT, for law school admission, is the closest to a pure IQ test. I kinda gave up on tutoring it, because the reality was there was only so much I could do for people...because it&amp;#39;s an IQ test! I would have gotten above 170 the first time I ever saw the material, because I have a very high IQ, and experience with the questions over time brings me up another 5 points probably. Nothing I can teach you is going to bring you from a 140 to a 180. Nothing. It&amp;#39;s an IQ test. And that&amp;#39;s fitting for law school, where you&amp;#39;re going to want a difficult test for elite-level cognitive and reasoning ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So are these tests perfect? No, and they couldn&amp;#39;t be. Are they generally pretty good though? Yes, absolutely. Do they give you a very solid baseline impression of the student you would be getting for your school or program? Totally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think people who dislike them tend to do so for the simple reason that they find them hard and don&amp;#39;t score well on them. And to address some other concerns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aren&amp;#39;t the tests culturally biased?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, they&amp;#39;re not. Even decades ago, where you might occasionally get a question about a &amp;quot;silo&amp;quot; or something that had disparate familiarity to different regions or people, that effect would have been small. Now they&amp;#39;ve gotten very careful about such things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way you can get to cultural bias now is if you go to crazy town where math itself is culturally biased, or the very concept of correct empirical answers is a symptom of white patriarchy. Yeah, there are people who go there, sadly, but they certainly shouldn&amp;#39;t be listened to by anyone serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But isn&amp;#39;t IQ testing is flawed, and aren&amp;#39;t there are multiple kinds of intelligence?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. At least, certainly not to the degree that gets around, again, spread by people with a certain agenda. The reality is that IQ testing is incredibly robust and predictive, possibly more so than any other psychological metric available. I crush basically all standardized tests, and always have, because the cognitive ability I apply to a test translates super readily through sections of that test, and to all the other tests as well. In high school I got a perfect score on sections of the SAT and ACT without any studying. And equivalently, I tend to score like 140 or so on IQ tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t that kind of invalidate your job?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit, yes. Like I said, I gave up teaching the LSAT because I felt full of shit. But I can certainly teach someone the rote math and grammar rules they need for the high school tests, and improve their score. Again, no one is going from a 430 to an 800 on an SAT section, but a 600 might be in the cards with some work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So why do people dislike these tests so much?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, because they themselves aren&amp;#39;t very good at them, or their kids don&amp;#39;t do well on them, and that makes them feel bad. So they try to say they don&amp;#39;t measure anything. There&amp;#39;s also a larger cultural movement that tries to dismantle all of these things if it&amp;#39;s shown that results are disparate among different races or sexes, because then that could only be the fault of the test being wrong and evil to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What could we do better?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was designing it from the ground up, I would have one test that was pure cognitive/IQ, and other tests that were tests of learned knowledge. You also want the math testing to have a harder curve into more difficult questions, because as it is getting a perfect on the math SAT or ACT is actually quite easy, and so there are students who might be exceptionally capable whose abilities won&amp;#39;t show up. The Korean CSAT is actually an awesome test - the English section is literally better than our English section, and the math section shows a nice road map to me of the level we should be both be teaching advanced students to, and testing them at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know human memory can be fickle. Remembering something exactly as it happened even 5 hours prior can prove to have some inconsistencies. It would be up to the DA’s Office to pull past reports from the officer, other reports from serving officers, available eye witness testimony and video evidence to show that this was not a case of remembering something incorrectly… but a blatant attempt to make the situation different than it was to excuse/condone the cops behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many cases of false reports come to my head at the moment. However, I recently saw one in New Jersey where a cop beat a guy in a hallway. He claimed the guy failed to raise his hands once told and also attacked the cop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one was a few years ago in a more high profile case, McDonald in Chicago. Several cops wrote in their report something that was incorrect once seen on camera. If one guy remembers something in correctly. Understandable…. If multiple remember something that didn’t happen but in the same manner… something is up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actions alone (regardless of any other actions by the cop or suspect) should be enough for time behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;

Youtube is a banned website in China, so why is China posting on youtube? Two reasons, one to spread their propaganda to the west to indoctrinate followers.  Two, in China there is a massive gray area, and many Chinese people have VPNs and brouse western websites such as youtube.  If China broadcasts their message on western websites which Chinese users have to download a VPN and enter a legal gray area to view, it will further drive home the message the CCP is right.  This is why if you search up Chinese youtube content, you can quickly find numerous channels run by westerners in China who are straight up CCP apologists.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some background; I&amp;#39;m reading this book &amp;#39;No Pity&amp;#39; for a class. I have not finished the book but in the first chapter there are some claims I disagree with. I feel ablest for holding these views but they seem to be right to me. So here I am. I have my degree in philosophy and I&amp;#39;m fairly progressive so I feel I am open to opposing view points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disabled as a minority group are very interesting because they are the only minority group that anyone can join and virtually any time. For very many people it is inevitable as they climb into old age. So when thinking of the plights of this minority group one must understand this can be them tomorrow if not with in 10, 20, or even 30 years from now. They could be your children or eventually your parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it were a possibility wouldn’t you want to prevent any and all of these people, including yourself, from these conditions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot help but to see it as a necessarily better condition to be in an able body than a disabled one. Ignoring this count I really don&amp;#39;t think I hold any other prejudices against any disabled person. I do not judge anyone by their disability. I think part of the government&amp;#39;s job is to account for the differences in the biological lottery. Thus it’s part of the government&amp;#39;s job to provide services for the disabled so they can live as independently as possible. Just the same as the government does for low income individuals. It’s all a part of the social safety net. The disabled population has a lot of untapped skills and talent because of people&amp;#39;s prejudices and that is a shame. A disabled person doesn&amp;#39;t have to be Steven Hawking to have a positive influence on the culture and society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to my point; In the book people are quoted saying to the effect that if a miracle cure was developed overnight would they take it? And all of them say no. This way I can understand your whole experience and identity is wrapped up in your material experience. Of course you don&amp;#39;t want to change who you are. Change is hard and who says this change is necessarily worth it if you have your life together already. Being able to see or walk or hear wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily make you a ‘better’ person. If anything, being abled will serve to alienate you from your community. As much as I don&amp;#39;t agree, I can respect this opinion and understand that my opinion really is meaningless to this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am having a really hard time understanding is this; “Most stunning was the finding announced in 1992 of the precise DNA location of the gene that caused myotonic dystrophy. Yet, once again, these breakthroughs were not cures so much as prevention measures. And to the new disability rights movement prevention had ominous overtones. Many activists fear that with the growth of such predictive tests, pregnant women will be expected or coerced to abort fetuses when there is an indication of disability. Others worry that if genetic engineering can one day wipe out an illness, a person who already has that disability will be seen as a freak or devalued as a preventable mistake.” I understand wanting to prevent social stigma that is always a fight worth having. But if we can make it so no one ever has to deal with a particular disability again then why not do preventable treatments with genetic engineering? For example if we find a miracle cure for mental retardation then why not utilize it? On the note of abortions I think that it is the women’s choice. She should not be convinced of a decision; she should make the choice herself. No one can tell anyone what to do with their bodies plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please convince me otherwise if you can. I am very interested to see some opposing arguments!&lt;/p&gt;

I know many people will say, &amp;quot;well, like it or not, you&amp;#39;re an adult at 18.&amp;quot; But we&amp;#39;ve determined as a society, in the US at least, that some adults (i.e., those under 21) cannot consume alcohol or cannabis (and even tobacco now in many places); thus, we already have exceptions when it comes to liberties one enjoys at age 18. This isn&amp;#39;t without precedent. And just so it&amp;#39;s explicit, I think this should apply to all genders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am making this argument for three main reasons. First, on a societal level, I think having 18 and 19 year olds in the sex work industry promotes ephebophilia in our culture (think about the popularity of the search term &amp;quot;teen&amp;quot; across many porn platforms...). Raising the age to 21 would at least reduce this widespread fantasy of someone &amp;quot;fresh out of high school.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason is that I think raising the minimum age of workers could help mitigate some of the coercion and predatory practices that can unfortunately co-occur in the industry (e.g., what was shown in Hot Girls Wanted). I think as people get older, especially after working a job or two, they tend to get a better sense of their self-worth, both as an individual and as a worker. Again, I know this would not eliminate bad actors in the industry, but I do think raising the average age of workers would act as a buffer to some of the more unsavory practices that can accompany sex work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, and somewhat related to the point above, I honestly think many people are not mature enough to make a potentially life-altering career decision at such a young age as 18. Based on personal experience being acquainted with people who have done some form of sex work (mostly stripping) and interviews with some pornstars/escorts I have seen, it strikes me that some people are cut out for it and some people are simply not. And, sadly, I think it can lead to a lot of regret and pain if you get too deep into it before knowing you&amp;#39;re not the type of person who can engage in the act of trading some sort of sexual service for money. Not to mention the fallout from doing (and later regretting) something like porn where there is a potentially permanent electronic record of your work. The short but developmentally critical transition period from adolescence to young adulthood (i.e., 18-21) should be about exploring your sexuality on your own personal terms before deciding you want to monetize and make a career of it for a while. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see that people may think this comes off as too paternalistic or sex-negative. Maybe it is, but again, we already do this in varying degrees in other domains in our society, so I&amp;#39;m not sure why this should be any different. I suppose you could change my view by presenting me some data to suggest that this would be impossible/ineffective or by enlightening me about some aspect or nuance of sex work that I&amp;#39;m ignoring or misunderstanding (insight from people who have worked in the industry would be especially welcome).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change my view.&lt;/p&gt;

I am half chinese/half white.  My mom is 100% Chinese, born in Hong Kong.  My fiancee is 100% white (for lack of a better term).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were all playing golf and saw an older Asian couple playing a second round.  The course attendant asked if they paid for a second round.  They said they didn&amp;#39;t think they needed to since no one else was using the course and already paid once.  He said they can&amp;#39;t do that, they paid for 1 round and only 1 round.  They were free to play again, they would just have to pay for another round.  I would think once you got caught, you&amp;#39;d say &amp;quot;my bad&amp;quot; and leave the course, but apparently the guy had to keep explaining why they can&amp;#39;t play for free just because there&amp;#39;s no one behind them.  They were still talking by the time we got to our car and pulling out like 5 minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom said something along the lines of &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s such a Chinese thing to do&amp;quot;.  My fiancee said we can&amp;#39;t say things like that, because it personally offends her.  I&amp;#39;m confused how someone of an unrelated race can be personally offended on behalf of another race for something said within that race.  I&amp;#39;d like to hear your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, I&amp;#39;ve also played extra holes at a course.  But you do that in the middle like holes 5-7.  And if I got talked to about it, I&amp;#39;d take the rightful blame, say I was in the wrong, and leave.  I&amp;#39;d never start at hole #1 like this couple did, that&amp;#39;s just asking to be talked to by the staff.  It&amp;#39;s also very obvious when last tee time is 7-730pm, and this couple is starting at hole #1 at like 8:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:  I said it below in another comment and after seeing what people said I should have used &amp;quot;shouldn&amp;#39;t be offended&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t be offended&amp;quot;.  And again that&amp;#39;s my opinion/view.  But anyone can be offended about anything, that&amp;#39;s their right.  Whether any change comes of it once that opinion if brought up is another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still think it would be out of place for me to have a stance that I would tell someone of a different race/gender what they can/can&amp;#39;t say about that particular race/gender that I&amp;#39;ve never been associated with or been a part of.  Especially when that statement is not intentionally derogatory, or mean spirited, more of &amp;quot;yup, that doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me, based on my personal experiences of being part of that group&amp;quot;.  I wouldn&amp;#39;t tell a black person what it means to other black people when certain things are said, like I wouldn&amp;#39;t tell someone that identifies as a woman that they can/can&amp;#39;t say things about other woman since I don&amp;#39;t know how it feels to be in that particular group.&lt;/p&gt;

The definition of hallucination is &amp;quot;a sensory experience that appears real, but is created by the mind&amp;quot;. - paraphrased from Healthline. This is often a symptom of several illnesses, so we can conclude that the person who claims to see/hear a deity has an illness, because nobody else can perceive what the other hears/sees. I think that claiming to see/hear a deity has no basis in reality, whatsoever, can potentially cause the person to do dangerous things and is very strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I perfectly accept that it is not in their control, and it is perfectly OK to have an illness, whether that be of mind or body, but why isn&amp;#39;t people claiming to see/hear deities viewed as an illness by doctors?

I can see some potential harm stemming from this type content in the form of a small percentage of their audiences who not only get enjoyment from reinforcing racial stereotypes but use it as an excuse to negatively discriminate or harm minorities. But in the long run I don&amp;#39;t see how pushing the comedic no go zone further and further towards what is politically correct is the most beneficial option. Ignorant people are everywhere, and trying to force society into a utopian world free of racism is a pipe dream which may only exacerbate racial issues. I think this type of racially stereotypical comedy gives these small minded people an opportunity to vent their prejudices openly for others to criticize rather than in a manner that is much more organized, insidious and underground. This type of comedy is the lesser of two evils, resulting in I believe nothing more than some hurt feelings and oftentimes bad comedy, whereas removing such an avenue may result in something similar to the beer halls of 20th century Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve thought about this for a while so I would like to see how my argument can be challenged and if possibly I am not looking at this the right way or haven&amp;#39;t taken something into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft should be entirely abolished it&amp;#39;s not needed, it&amp;#39;s outdated, and it isn&amp;#39;t a working model in the US military. The military doesn&amp;#39;t even want to have to use the draft. It&amp;#39;s a shit institution that doesn&amp;#39;t work in the US. Compulsory service works in other countries but not ours. My reasonings are as followed with supporting links or as many as I could find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sss.gov/history-and-records/induction-statistics/&quot;&gt;They&amp;#39;ve statistically used it less each time&lt;/a&gt; during ww1 over 50% were draftees. By Vietnam era, it was less than 30% across all four branches and less than 20% of the draftees were sent to combat or hot zones.  Culminating in only 676 individuals being drafted in 1973. Little historical fact we even drafted people on both sides during the civil war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.) Vietnam gave rise to the professional or career soldier, we have one of the strongest volunteer forces in the world. The military is not hurting for people they turn people away every day and give out pink slips to people who are in Military Occupations that are overcrowded or phases out because it&amp;#39;s obsolete. Example of this would be barbers, yes king of the hill was accurate on that they did once exist. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/6-awesome-army-jobs-that-no-longer-exist/&quot;&gt;List of six jobs (though there are more) that no longer exist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easier to be disqualified than qualified for service and women on average are more qualified than men. Which is just one of the reasons that they opened up the combat arms military occupational specialties to women to broaden the pool from which they can recruit. There are several factors of why this is but, &lt;a href=&quot;https://militarybenefits.info/army-height-weight-requirements/&quot;&gt;weight and height&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/disqualifiers-medical-conditions.html&quot;&gt;general health&lt;/a&gt;, less likely to have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalancecareers.com/us-military-enlistment-standards-3354006&quot;&gt;criminal record&lt;/a&gt;, better scores on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/asvab/asvab-test-explained.html&quot;&gt;ASVAB (armed service aptitude battery test)&lt;/a&gt;, etc to name a few. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.) Draftees are bad for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_cohesion#:%7E:text=Unit%20cohesion%20is%20a%20military,despite%20combat%20or%20mission%20stress%22.&quot;&gt;unit cohesion (may not seem important but it is a very important component for a functioning military)&lt;/a&gt; and the emotional health of those around them. They also can be extremely dangerous and end up getting themselves or someone else killed. We learned this during Vietnam. They tend to be undisciplined, unmotivated, poorly trained because it&amp;#39;s about quantity not quality ,and let&amp;#39;s add-in you&amp;#39;re taking people who don&amp;#39;t want to be somewhere training them to kill, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/5172/drawn-into-violence-evidence-on-what-makes-a-criminal-from-the-vietnam-draft-lotteries&quot;&gt;then handing them a loaded weapon&lt;/a&gt;. What could go wrong? Look up friendly fire and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.historynet.com/the-hard-truth-about-fragging.htm&quot;&gt;fragging incidents&lt;/a&gt; that happened during Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.) The US military has backups with more backups in place to avoid using the draft at all costs. Everyone that signs an enlistment contract agrees to double time. For example, you sign a four-year contract with the US Army to be a 13b (cannon crew member in field artillery) what you owe them is 8 years. 4 years active, and upon release of service you owe 4 more years in the IRR or inactive ready reserve. During which time you can be recalled to active duty. Some specialized jobs allow up to 10 years. It&amp;#39;s cheaper, cost and time effective to bring back people who already have been trained and just give them a refresher course versus the time and money it takes to train a new recruit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If in the event another 9/11 happened they would &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A.) first recall all IRR at any given time that&amp;#39;s over a million people at any given time that fall within the window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;B.) The next step they would take is lowering the standards for entrance. In point 2 I mentioned it&amp;#39;s difficult well now all those people that would ordinarily be turned away for hand tattoos, face tattoos, low scores on the ASVAB, that person that had therapy one time as a kid, that individual that had a bit of a criminal record, etc are now being taken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C.) They activate the National Guard of each state and the Reservists of each branch placing them on active duty orders. (We have tons of these).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;D.) Stop loss is initatied any service members contracts that were about to expire are now extended preventing force loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;E.) And if all of that fails to provide enough then and only then is the draft activated by Congress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a catch, if you&amp;#39;re overweight, have a history of mental illness, health problems, too short, under 18, in your mid-30s, in college, can&amp;#39;t meet even the lowered standard on the ASVAB which shows you are cannot be  trained (not joking there are people that try on this test and want to be in who score below the minimum 31 out of 99 there are people who score in the single digits), that ASVAB you took in high school already let them know of you were qualified or not so if you bombed it your name wouldn&amp;#39;t even be up for consideration of the draft board, a single parent and you have full custody of your kid, you&amp;#39;re not going to get drafted. As it stands right now with no draft and no lowered standard males of 18-34(?) only 49% of the them are deemed fit for service. Females the numbers are at 51% is qualified. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.) We don&amp;#39;t fight the way we used to fight, warfare has evolved we aren&amp;#39;t just throwing body after body at targets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/olj/sa/sa_99anv02.html&quot;&gt;We use technology&lt;/a&gt; that has allowed us to go from 2.7 million during the height of the Vietnam War to 1.4 million with us fighting on two fronts. Technology has cut the need in half because we are able to use it as a force multiplier vs using actual physical bodies. Not to mention all the other operations that take place every day that the general public is unaware of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;6.) Draftees legally are only required to serve a year deployed. Ie one tour, it costs more money using the draft because they have to get a fresh batch in every year as opposed to regular volunteer enlisted members who they can use what&amp;#39;s called stop-loss where they involuntarily extend the service members contract. It costs approximately $90,000 to train and equip one infantryman in the military and their training is only 22 weeks un the Army. That&amp;#39;s just through training, now imagine that plus not to mention the wasted money and man-hours spent chasing down draft dodgers. The draft is not cheap nor is it a sustainable model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft is not needed, it&amp;#39;s outdated, ineffective, and the military DOES NOT want draftees there because historically they cause more problems and are a hindrance. It shouldn&amp;#39;t include women it should be completely abolished.&lt;/p&gt;

That&amp;#39;s all you see in the new, on social media and especially on Reddit . My view is that there has never ever been a better time to be alive. For anyone, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food has never been more plentiful, despite increasing populations. Almost every key resources are plentiful despite record populations. The share of income spent on food has steeply declined as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A higher percentage of children make it through childhood today than ever before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to knowledge has never been easier, and cheaper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air quality world wide has never been better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global poverty is at an all time low. Child labor world wide is on a steep decline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global literacy rate is at an all time high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal freedom is most countries is also at an all time high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standards of living in almost every country has drastically increased. In developed countries, you have access to news, entertainment, food, flights, games at the press of a few buttons.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medicine.&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#39;t think anyone needs convincing how much better modern medicine has made the world.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s never been more accessible for the average person to start a business or make money from personal projects or creative works, eg on Youtube, Instagrams or small online stores. Small side gigs have never been so profitable and accessible (Uber, DoorDash etc) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been been more possibilities available to the average person on Earth. And more people than ever before have access to this level of leisure time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, technological innovations are on the rise, promising even better medicine, education and living standards in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time there&amp;#39;s a fresh outrage we get more bans, more restrictions and more of a political divide between groups of people, the platforms control you a little more and everyone distracts each other with congratulations on an outrage well done. Meanwhile the big boys up top continue to seize more and more control without us ever really noticing. They don&amp;#39;t care one bit about your politics or your feelings, they just see an opportunity to exploit this current political environment to seize control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have no clue how these algorithms work and they&amp;#39;re starting to get pretty spooky. I believe we&amp;#39;re perched in a very precarious state right now with no clear out. It&amp;#39;s impossible to trust anything because you really never know why you&amp;#39;re being shown something and you don&amp;#39;t know where it originated from. Especially on TikTok, we truly have no idea what TikTok does, it&amp;#39;s completely opaque and hails straight from China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the longest time I have believed that the term African-American is racist for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lumps all black people into the same category as being African. The person being referred to as African may be from Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, the Solomon Islands etc., or their grandparents or great-grandparents were from there. They may have no closer ancestry to any area in Africa than a white American with English ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term becomes useless as soon as the person is in America but not American. Then what are they called? Black. So I don’t see the point in calling someone African-American instead of black when the next black person who isn’t American you have to use a term for, you call them black anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It segregates different colours for absolutely no reason and is totally unnecessary. What do they call a black German person? Do they call them African-German? No, they’re just German. They’re as German as anyone else. Calling someone African-American instead of just American suggests that they’re not the same as a white American, which they are. They’re born in the United States or are naturalised, they might never have been to Africa in their lives and have no African relatives, so they’re not African-American, they’re just American. Otherwise any white American needs to be referred to as English-American or Irish-American or Slovakian-American, instead of being categorised as white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s a more polite way of saying someone is black, or a categorisation or any other use of the term, it just seems racist to me to call someone ‘African’ because they’re black regardless of what their background or heritage is, and no other country I can think of categorises their black citizens or any other BAME people as ‘African’ or ‘Asian’ or anything else. Germans are Germans, Australians are Australians, Americans should be Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been homeless nor poor, I’m upper middle class. However, I never look down on the homeless and give them money instead of outright giving food to them. I feel the only people who get butthurt are those who offer food just to boost their ego. If I were homeless, I’d never take someone’s half eaten food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see so many posts saying “I only ever offer food because the money will go to drugs”. That’s not why you’re not giving money…I’m sick of people bullshitting with that excuse to not give money. Besides, don’t people ever think that maybe the homeless guy just ate? Or he can’t carry 100 McDonald’s sandwiches that people offer him? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because he turns down your food that you thought was gourmet, doesn’t mean he’s a choosy beggar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I think it’s perfectly fine to give someone food if they ask for it. What I have a problem with is the people who go up to homeless offering their leftovers, then getting angry when the homeless guy turns the food down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: What I mean by leftovers is half eaten food/spoiled food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to improve myself and follow the teachings of my religion, but it seems like some people don&amp;#39;t even TRY to follow the teachings of the religion that they claim to be a part of. They don&amp;#39;t attend religious services often when it is expected of them, break many commandments that their religion has and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that the teachings of many religions talk about being accepting of those who are trying to improve themselves and to not be too judgmental of those who choose to &amp;quot;sin&amp;quot;, but there has to be a point where the  religious devotions they do offer every once in a while could be seen as mocking in a way towards the higher power they profess to believe in and worship, but they spend MUCH more time thinking of the next one night stand, cookout, night out with their friends binge drinking, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would think that they would be more comfortable embracing a belief system that excludes a higher power and religious devotion so they don&amp;#39;t feel like they&amp;#39;re stuck in a devotion system that they aren&amp;#39;t truly involved with. You&amp;#39;re outwardly expressing the beliefs you have on the inside of yourself. Sure, you may disappoint friends and family you have who are religious, but it beats the inner turmoil of being in a part of a belief system you begrudgingly accept for one reason or another.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, if an individual who is female by sex decides they are non-binary, they are compartmentalizing the definition of a woman. What does it mean to be a woman? Dresses and makeup? If you said yes to the previous question, you are stereotyping. Not all women wear dresses, not all women wear makeup, not all women have vaginas, and not all women “feel” like women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened to having pride in being a woman, even if you don’t follow the stereotype? Even if you prefer a boyish haircut and a “not-so-feminine” voice and plaid button-ups, you can have pride in being part of the diversity of women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that non-binary is a liberation of the self and breaking free from society’s definitions of man and woman, but removing yourself from your gender label emphasizes that men and women must follow their conventional roles, making the situation even worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would rather live in a world where being called he or she doesn’t connotate stereotypes than in a world where a myriad of pronoun possibilities nuance the non-women and non-man qualities and force harsher stereotypes on those who are called he or she. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** I would like to clarify that I am discussing non-binary genders. Transgender (ftm or mtf) is something else since they are not alienating their assigned sex/gender because they don’t feel “manly” enough to be male; they identify with the other gender because they identify with the other gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear from the beginning. I think that anyone who is against fairness or equal chances should significantly rethink their life philosophy. Being discriminated based on gender / race / etc is horrible and we should do everything in our power to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, from what I notice, the number one initiative to tackles this issue is to impose a diversity quota. You all see this : we commit to have 50% of our board members females, or x% of our workforce latino, etc (depends on the geography as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My assumption is that this strategy is to “force” change, by setting these targets. In essence, any organization with such a target needs to do everything in their power to change the way they recruit and promote talent to reach that target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also assume this kind of initiatives happen mostly in highly skilled white collar workforce organizations. I don’t see anyone advocating we increase the % of men as hairdressers, % of women as bricklayers, % of blacks in sports, or even ridiculous things like a quotas for prisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, I think that these type of policies have the opposite effect than intended. What happens is that companies blindly promote and recruit based on diversity rather than best talent. This leads to more conflict as we are creating environments where employees feel treated unfair since whatever population is underrepresented is privileged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are we not rather focusing on creating equal chances? Blind CVs, better maternity/paternity rules, inclusion trainings, etc. If we treat the process fair, why care if the result is 70%women- 30%men , or whatever you want to measure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very curious what you have to say!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Really interesting conversations! Thanks for the people who took their time to answer. While I do think a lot of the comments are going off topic, I definitely learned more about this issue. In reading more about the topic, I came across some interesting materials. Have a look if you are interested:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/business/2018/02/17/ten-years-on-from-norways-quota-for-women-on-corporate-boards&quot;&gt;https://www.economist.com/business/2018/02/17/ten-years-on-from-norways-quota-for-women-on-corporate-boards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still not convinced that gender quotas is the right way to go forward, and do believe that there are unintended consequences. However, I am optimistic for the future and hope all of us who feel under represented will see better days. &lt;/p&gt;
