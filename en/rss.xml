In my opinion it should be illegal for an insurance provider to have access to &amp;#39;plan discounts&amp;#39; that the average consumer cannot have access to. An example, I have needed some blood work and imaging recently. Quest diagnostics billed nearly $800 total for 2 round of blood work. The insurance company paid approximately $80 of it, due to the plan discount. This is the case across the board. Needed an MRI, cost was $2200, the plan discount brought it down to $950. To be clear, they reduced the total amount to those values via plan discounts, I&amp;#39;m not complaining that they didn&amp;#39;t cover the remainder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has a major issue with their cost of Healthcare. Can someone change my view and explain to me what the benefit of allowing this is, versus the MRI just costing $950 and the blood work just costing $40 and forcing the insurance company to pay the 100% (assuming the plan states they need to cover 100%).&lt;/p&gt;

Its cute thats all that matters!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People may say I’m over exaggerating the fact of calling it animal cruelty but thats honestly my view of the issue, effecting the animals health or body structure for the worse to make the animal seem cuter isn’t good for anyone but the owners view on the dog.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list goes on and on of dog breeds with health issues due to breeding: Basset hound, Lhasa Apso, Chihuahua, Bulldogs, Shih tzu, Boston Terriers. And thats just some of the dogs with high chances of breathing issues, ear/eye infections and joint issues, whats the point of continuing to breed animals like this? The demand? Money? Doesn’t matter, why should these come before the welfare of a living thing?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly just don’t get it so if you guys could try and change my view on this issue it would be an interesting topic to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

And yes, I am from the US if that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure if I was exposed to either language on a regular basis, I could probably tell you the difference between them because they seem to be fairly dissimilar despite both being tonal languages, but I don&amp;#39;t. I don&amp;#39;t live in an area with a lot of mandarin or Thai speakers that I know of and I don&amp;#39;t have any of those heritages in my immediate family. So, if I heard it in passing, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d know the difference off the top of my head. Does that make me racist? I don&amp;#39;t think so. I think it&amp;#39;s simply a difference of what I&amp;#39;ve been exposed to in my everyday life, but I&amp;#39;d love to hear everyone&amp;#39;s thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

If a male celebrity came out and said he has sex with women we all wouldnt care and say that&amp;#39;s not news, in my opinion that&amp;#39;s how we should treat people coming out as gay. If the whole point of putting it in the news is the get more people to be accepting of it then it&amp;#39;s not gonna work. If someone doesn&amp;#39;t like people for being gay, putting it in their face that someone is gay isn&amp;#39;t gonna change how they see gay people.&lt;/p&gt;

Narcissistic, stubborn, narrow minded and self righteous, and all the other terms you can think about to describe horrible parents. Toxic parents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should any kid stay to take care of their parents if they were toxic to them? In fact, &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; parents have children because they’re afraid of dying alone and expects their children to take care of them. (a good number of old asian parents do that btw, source: am Asian) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By these type of parents I mean, parents who can’t accept their children’s sexuality or religion. Like when religious parents find out their kid is gay or is atheist and they completely lose their shit. Like as if being gay is wrong or a crime, or if not believing in god is a sin. Clearly some parents live in the Stone Age when it’s fucking 2021 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parents constantly trying to control them / controlling them when they were young, constantly arguing with them and manipulate them. Gaslighting them and guilt tripping them.  Or having insane expectations that their kids need to get all A’s or they are a disgarce to the family, or that their kids need to do a high end job / prestigious job like a doctor, etc (asian parent mindset) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t owe shit to our parents, they decided to bring us to the world. If they were good parents, then in return, they deserve to be taken care of. If you had a shitty childhood / majority of your life was shit when you lived with them, then they deserve to die alone and deserve to be abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;

I think they should be legalized, taxed and regularized as it looks to me that the pros of doing that clearly outweight the cons. I am a &lt;em&gt;clean&lt;/em&gt; guy, I don&amp;#39;t drink and I don&amp;#39;t smoke. I am curious of weed and psychedelics, but at the moment I have no intention of experimenting with that because I don&amp;#39;t want to finance organized crime (all drugs are illegal where I live): there&amp;#39;s people who are literally enslaved, abused and extorted to get the traffic going, and I don&amp;#39;t really think a transient moment of hedonism warrants feeding into this cycle. I don&amp;#39;t have alternative access. And even if I had, I can&amp;#39;t trust the way it&amp;#39;s produced and the substances it is mixed with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided that I want to be more informed about drugs in general, so I started reading more on the topic. I&amp;#39;m getting more confused and lowkey furious as the only kinds of opinion I find are 2: drugs are immoral and dangerous and you should NEVER use them, or drugs do no harm at all and you should just be a little cautious. Bear in mind that I&amp;#39;m generalizing a big deal. What I&amp;#39;m saying is that I can&amp;#39;t seem to find balanced opinions on the matter, and each position has its degree of conspiratorial thinking backed into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate the position that all drugs are harmful under any circumstances because it&amp;#39;s a stance that has never produced the desired effects. People won&amp;#39;t stop using drugs, and if they don&amp;#39;t abuse illegal ones they will very likely abuse legal ones. Alcohol is one of the most dangerous drugs legally available on the market and it can have devastating effects on its users. Although rare, people can use paint and glue as means to get high, you simply can&amp;#39;t stop it. Weed, among all illegal drugs, is probably one of the most harmless to exist in nature, definitely less dangerous than alcohol for both the consumers and those around them. Psychedelics have also been shown to help both in the treatment and rehab of most psychological conditions and of addiction itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So... why the title you may ask? Well... because drugs ARE fucking dangerous, that&amp;#39;s why!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m growing increasingly impatient with scientists, activists and fake-gurus who talk about how everyone should take psychedelics, that there&amp;#39;s no such a thing as &amp;quot;too much weed&amp;quot;, and that using heavy drugs just every now and then doesn&amp;#39;t hurt. That&amp;#39;s irresponsible, misguided and dangerous, particularly for minors. In my experience, and that of the people I&amp;#39;m most intimate with, that&amp;#39;s a load of bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s been a steep increase in drug use in recent years. Every social circle I&amp;#39;ve been in has loads of people smoking weed. There&amp;#39;s basically no socialization if weed is missing.. And inevitably those who consume the most of it also consume other drugs and are involved in questionable pursuits. The more I see drugs circulating in a certain group, the more I see a great acceptance of antisocial behavior and a seriously impaired sense of judgment. Pure collectivized denial. Some of them are in an extremely sad state, clearly dissociated and incapable of thinking straight, but nobody seems to notice or care rationalizing with &amp;quot;but that&amp;#39;s just the way they are&amp;quot;. My brother is diagnosed with BD type 1 and his psychotic episodes were most likely triggered by his consistent weed use. He cut the weed, and while the psychosis was less intense his mood remained impaired until he found the right medication. You might argue that he only had adverse reactions because he was already prone to it, but does that change anything at all? Do you think that the widespread message that weed doesn&amp;#39;t really hurt helps anyone with the knowledge that adverse reactions aren&amp;#39;t at all uncommon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I encounter an otherwise interesting source speaking about drugs there&amp;#39;s always a moment in which they will say something cospiratorial in nature, such as the idea that all the drugs being banned are the ones that make you question the government and stuff like that. You literally CAN&amp;#39;T PROVE THAT. There&amp;#39;s never real meat behind that, but even if that was the case then I think you need to talk to those who say that the 60s activist movements were deliberately dismantled by the CIA by introducing drugs in the picture. Like... get the story straight, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s as if it wasn&amp;#39;t blatant how there&amp;#39;s a whole circus of enterpreneurs that are just waiting to capitalize on the weed market and use all the bullshit spewed by these activists for their marketing campaigns. The speculation is already blatant. I keep seeing bullshit like &amp;quot;cannabis smoke doesn&amp;#39;t cause cancer&amp;quot;, as if it wasn&amp;#39;t known that consistent inhalation of hot smoke is detrimental to anyone&amp;#39;s health. Anyway, most people I know mix weed with tobacco so that&amp;#39;s a pointless objection really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we really want to politicize things, we should also remember that when 19th century China tried to become independent from colonizers Britain and other countries actively worked to hook the chinese population on opium in an attempt to make them become more compliant and less willing to rebel against european influences, sparking an addiction epidemic that lasted decades. Look that up: the opium wars. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/37G0JmU6NwM?t=1134&quot;&gt;I find this interview with John McAfee and his opinions on weed quite interesting.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rant is incomplete, but I guess you got the gist of it. I&amp;#39;m for the legalization of drugs for the possible applications in healthcare and to starve off organized crime, and why not, for occasional recreational use (meaning not every day, possibly not even every week). But I still think it&amp;#39;s dangerous and can very easily become a pernicious vice that can destroy your life.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a few very basic flaws that are obvious to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devaluation of fiat. Fiat is already not in a great spot in many places due to the absurd money printing for COVID relief spending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following that, a government is not going to allow something that further devalues their currency and then cuts into tax revenue on top of that, since Bitcoin is untaxable. I&amp;#39;m fiscally conservative, but tax revenue is certainly necessary. Governments could fine companies who take Bitcoin, essentially taxing them and removing the incentive to use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fragmentation of the economy. You can&amp;#39;t run a modern economy with multiple currencies, all holding different values that fluctuate wildly. If I go to the store with one dollar, I can be confident that the purchasing power of that dollar will be the same next week. Yes, inflation happens, but it is usually gradual and measured. My dollar will be able to buy me a candy bar next month the same as it can this month. Bitcoin (and other currencies that follow its lead) has wild swings of 10% within days, sometimes hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elon Musk has singlehandedly sent Bitcoin crashing with one tweet. You can&amp;#39;t do that to fiat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t seen any good rebuttals to these very simple arguments. I see crypto as a gamble, not an investment. There is no thesis required, and the vast majority of crypto fans seem to do their DD by reading tweets from big holders that want to pump the price. There aren&amp;#39;t earnings, balance sheets, SEC filings to look at for Bitcoin. The stock market can be irrational, yes, but crypto seems like it&amp;#39;s very obviously doomed to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in the United States is a privilege and denying it is, is ridiculous. I work in a warehouse with many people who immigrated to the United States and through asking them what they think about the US, 100% of them could not be more happy with how their lives have improved after moving here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, one of the arguments I have heard is that our Founding Fathers were slave owners and did atrocious things in the past, so why would I want to celebrate that. Yes they were, and there is no denying that, but why is this alone a justification for not celebrating our freedom and ideas that were created by the same Founding Fathers.&lt;/p&gt;

On occasion, they would reveal some valuable insight, engaging interviews, or impressive journalism. Normally, though, most of the enjoyment came from watching them lambast conservative hypocrisies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However... Are they actually doing more harm than good to society?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thinking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans often hold beliefs that they don&amp;#39;t really identify with and don&amp;#39;t hold strongly. However, once they&amp;#39;re mocked for those beliefs, they&amp;#39;ll dig their heels in and believe it 10x as strongly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s my understanding that many conservatives feel they are constantly being mocked by elitist, privileged, Leftists very often for superficial reasons or insulting stereotypes (e.g., &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re dumb because you have a country accent.&amp;quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Daily Show is a constant source of mockery, which could trigger (2) above, and by extension (1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, it&amp;#39;s rare to see The Daily Show use in-depth arguments to defend liberal stances. Usually, it just goes for the simple arguments (which sometimes don&amp;#39;t stand up to scrutiny, even when I agree with the conclusion!) and easy jokes. So there&amp;#39;s not much good being done here to balance out the potential harm of (3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Some more background: I went from seldom watching Trevor Noah to never watching him again after Trump was elected president; the jokes just didn&amp;#39;t seem funny anymore. The stakes were too high, the situation too severe with someone like Trump in office. What&amp;#39;s the point of laughing at Trump&amp;#39;s tiny hands when his actions have such terribly large effect?)&lt;/p&gt;

My partner believes smoking weed everyday is okay but I think marijuana and alcohol are similar in that, you shouldn&amp;#39;t over use any substance, because at some point you begin using it to cope with life&amp;#39;s daily challenges instead of learning to face your issues. I think if you&amp;#39;re healthy and have no medical reason to smoke every day, that it&amp;#39;s probably not a good habit.

&lt;p&gt;A teachers ability isn&amp;#39;t diminished because they once was a can girl. 
I know people will say that a teachers job is also about interacting with parents. 
But I think patents are in the wrong. It isn&amp;#39;t reasonable in the first place to care if the teacher was once a stripper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this is a complex issue with multiple layers but I think the entire process and the view that its OK to fire is all wrong. If its about how the kids will react if they find out their teacher is a sex worker, I think keeping the teacher and fostering a society that is sex positive will change exactly the problem people think will happen. Obviously its easier said then done. I would like to live in a world where kids just shrug and say, oh my teacher was a sex worker? Whatever. Children shouldn&amp;#39;t be watching porn anyways so if they do find out that&amp;#39;s on the parents who gave them access. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, my view is a world where teachers aren&amp;#39;t fired for their sex work is better than a world where they do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have wanted to get a motorcycle since I was a teenager but I didn&amp;#39;t have the money. Now I can afford one but I am married with two kids and I cannot help but think that it is an unnecessary risk that will make me much more likely to leave my children fatherless.  If I didn&amp;#39;t have a wife and kids I would definitely have one at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the source, I have seen estimates that you are 27 to 35 times more likely to die per mile traveled on a motorcycle than in a car.  To me this seems unacceptably risky. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do realize that this is probably a self fulfilling issue to some degree. Motorcycles are seen as risky, therefore people who take more risks ride them, therefore more risks are taken on motorcycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do believe that as a risk adverse person with a lot to live for I could probably be safer than the average would suggest, but how much?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be swayed by statistics showing, for example, how much less likely you are to die if you wear all the gear all the time, or showing that the vast majority of fatalities are during specific road conditions that could be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately an anecdote that you have rode for 40 years and never had an accident will not change my view, though I would be happy to hear what habits you think have lead to your excellent record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be happy to hear from other parents about how they justify the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mainly see and hear this coming from people in the USA, but I see it in Canada too: I can&amp;#39;t wrap my head around thanking someone for a service/job that they signed up for. Most of the military will never see combat in their life, and if they do it is because they signed up knowing that they could die on the job due to the position they signed up for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pay and perks are generally pretty good if you are in combat, and this reflects the danger that you are signing up for. It&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s a surprise! So why do we still do this seemingly mandatory congratulatory back rub in North America? Especially when all the combative wars we are currently involved in are unnecessary for the safety of our continent and countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open to discussion why this is still an important thing to do. To me it seems grandfathered in from wars gone by and doesn&amp;#39;t truly reflect what is going in modern North America&lt;/p&gt;

Here are my reasons for believing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One - Instagram is losing its niche&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram had a successful niche as a photo-sharing platform, and that is still ultimately what most creators and users use it for. Users use it because they want to see photos and engage with them. However, Instagram is now moving to attempt to compete with YouTube and TikTok, which will ultimately fail because those platforms are already occupying their respective niches, and doing a good job at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two - Instagram isn&amp;#39;t showing people what they want to see&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that most casual users of Instagram are like myself - we follow pages that we want to use, which usually includes our friends and pages of interest that we are interested in. Instagram&amp;#39;s attempt to push people to look at pages that they don&amp;#39;t even follow at the expense of pages that they do is driving users away and lowering users&amp;#39; interest in the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I think that Instagram will eventually die out, and pretty soon at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also undercover cops, vans, cruisers being used for routine traffic enforcement seem blatantly unconstitutional because they amount to a search of the public without warrant or probable cause. Crime can happen anywhere, behind closed doors or on the streets and nothing is preventing police from enforcing traffic laws in plainly marked vehicles. Using unmarked vehicles is the same thing as policing an area without a warrant to search &amp;#39;looking for probable cause&amp;#39;. The warrant is already there, police have some function to protect the public, but hiding that warrant, which is the police presence, goes beyond legal limits placed on government by the bill of rights. Police in an area already amounts to a search, you cant hide the fact you are there and still call yourself law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for undercover police infiltrating freely associated groups, as they have no probable cause and the state cannot sanction the search of a group of people. People also cannot &amp;#39;surrender&amp;#39; that right or any other right, depending on which platform is used. I believe that act is also unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;

Equal pay in other stuff is reasonable like doing the same office job. But in the context of sports, I dont see equal pay in women&amp;#39;s football being realistic in the current women&amp;#39;s market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my general knowledge of sports. Salary for players are usually determined by the total revenue of the league divided between the player&amp;#39;s salary, the owners, and the league&amp;#39;s administration. As an example, the NFL distributes is revenue by giving 49% to the profits for player&amp;#39;s salary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I believe the real reason women don&amp;#39;t get equally paid in football is mainly due to the lack of revenue in women&amp;#39;s soccer. The best women&amp;#39;s soccer player wants to be paid the same as Messi or ronaldo. But the question is do they generate as much money as those two soccer giants? I believe the lack of revenue generated in women&amp;#39;s football leagues will limit their salaries. They need more demand where people want to pay just as much as mens league to watch and of course have the same amount of people willing to pay the same price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the whole movement seems weak because by paying the same wage as men they are bankrupting their own league. Where is the money coming from? Because they don&amp;#39;t generate enough revenue for equal pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, women&amp;#39;s tennis generates high revenue. There is a reason they are the highest paid female athletes. They bring in fans and money. Not quite equal to the male tennis wage, but the gap is much smaller compared to other sports. Hence, revenue generated = higher salaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this entire movement was based on unfair percentage split then I am supporting them. But the issue is the absolute revenue is just so low compared to men. Sports is essentially entertainment. You get paid by the demand of people wanting to spend to watch you. Women&amp;#39;s football league just doesn&amp;#39;t have the demand comparable to the men&amp;#39;s league. They should focus on increasing that demand and revenue rather than asking for something that is not even available. Cause there is not enough money available to pay all the women football players the same as men.&lt;/p&gt;

However I do not like that an officer with no training gets to decide to actually charge you with the crime, I believe at most a driver should be taken to the drunk tank and then released (WITH vehicle) and if the blood tests come back negative, then they can charge them and set up a court date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw this because years ago I was pulled over and apparently failed a field sobriety test. I was not on anything, my car was impounded for 30 days, and I had to miss work sometimes due to lack of ride, as well as going to multiple court dates because they kept scheduling them before they had the results, so I would wait all day in court only to be called up and rescheduled because they don&amp;#39;t have the blood work back. Finally I go and they say &amp;quot;oh your blood work was negative, you&amp;#39;re free to leave&amp;quot; but of course no refund for paying close to $2000 to get my car out of impound or anything. I&amp;#39;m not sure what should be the exact solution to this, but I do know that something needs to change&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was watching a YouTube video of a European women showing how to do a Nordic/Viking style braid. She braided two cornrows (she called them cornrows but I think they were really Dutch braids) on both sides of her head, and then did a big braid on top, gathered all the braids together into a pony in the back. Some people were upset in the comments though, saying that she is appropriating black culture by doing these small Dutch braids, even though this hairstyle was done by vikings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example, I saw a tiktok of these white girls at a pool, and they all were wearing a silk scarf on their head. People in the comments were upset by this, and claimed they were appropriating black culture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just dont understand how a culture can own a certain style of braid or a certain way to tie a scarf to your head. If someone is wearing their hair like that, and they aren&amp;#39;t doing it to be racist, I dont see the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone please explain this to me. I hope this doesn&amp;#39;t come off as racist or ignorant, I&amp;#39;m not trying to be I just dont understand.&lt;/p&gt;

He realized that he had had too much to drink, so he called a ride.  It was mid August and super hot outside, so while he was waiting on his ride he sat in in his truck and ran the A/C.  A police officer saw him and took him in for a DWI and he was convicted.  It effected his employment and schooling for the next couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never liked the guy much, but I always thought he got a raw deal. He was doing the right thing and got the same penalty as if he decided to drive home.  You should be able to sleep it off in your car without fear of consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard the argument that if the officer saw a drunk sitting in their car and just walked away from it, the person could start driving at any moment.  I argue that it would be just as easy to take the person home as it would be to take them to jail, and it doesnt ruin their life. The police could even take them to the jail to dry out for the night just to be sure, but there is no reason to suspend their license, fine, and imprison a person for simply sitting in their car with the keys in their possession, or even sitting in a running vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To head off the first argument I see coming, this doesn&amp;#39;t apply to a vehicle in a lane of traffic, obviously if you are passed out at a stop sign or something you deserve a DWI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A.) He mean $40 a pound.  For all the risk they are taking to make Meth, that seems like too small of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B.) Me meant $40,000 a pound.  This sounds like astronomically too high.  How could Meth junkies ever afford their meth if 1 pound sells for 1 years minimum wage salary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C.) He mis-poke, and meant $40 an ounce.  This sounds most plausible to me, as it means they are making some decent money from their risk and Meth junkies can still afford to buy their meth.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.) There are 16 ounces in a pound. (Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;amp;q=ounces+in+a+pound&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.) They are working for 13 weeks.  (Source:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming ~31 days in a month, ~31 x 3 = ~93 days in 3 months.  ~93/7 = ~13 weeks in 3 months)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.)  Conclusion: The meth they make for Gus during the 3 months can sell for ~1.5 million dollars.  (Source:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$40 (per ounce) x 16 (ounces per pound) x 200 (pounds per week) x 13 (weeks in the job) = $1,664,000, or ~1.5 million dollars)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets get down to the problems here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gus is losing money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gus is paying 3 million dollars for these two guys to make product that he will sell for 1.5 million dollars.  That&amp;#39;s 1.5 million dollars down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walter and Jessie are bad at Math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie and Walter both come to the conclusion that Gus is making 93 million off their 3 month job.  Given all the information we have, they should have come to 1.5 million.  Jessie I could understand making a mistake somewhere in this math.  But Walter is supposed to be the smart guy.  How could he also make this mistake?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would change my view&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Show me a way to interpret the information in the show in such a way that the job is profitable for Gus while still being based in reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Explain why both Walter and Jessie made such bad math mistakes in their calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus points if you can do both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What wouldn&amp;#39;t change my view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was a mistake the show-writers made.&lt;/em&gt;  If this is the case I apologize since it means there isn&amp;#39;t really a view to be changed here.  However, I have hope that there is something I am missing that explains this mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edits/deltas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gus is doing this venture as a long term plan.  Once he has Walt&amp;#39;s formula, he can start making money again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The math at $40k a pound checks out for Walter and Jessie&amp;#39;s calculation if you assume 12 weeks instead of 13 weeks.  12 instead of 13 weeks seems like a simple enough mistake if you assume the 4 weeks per month as many people do.  $40k a pound for meth seems unrealistic to me, but at least that is a flaw in the world building rather than Walter or Jessie&amp;#39;s character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junkies buy in teenths (1/16 of an ounce), which makes selling Meth at $40k a pound more reasonable.  Also, $40k a pound checks out with how much money Walter and Jessie were making when they cooked in their RV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real Meth sells at about the $40k per pound value.  Looks like the show was actually being very realistic after all!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Why not simply parent your child and make sure they aren&amp;#39;t consuming content you don&amp;#39;t see fit for your child?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also ruins songs and programs for us adults. There have been parts that are so heavily censored that the joke is basically how censored it is cause you&amp;#39;ll never hear the actual words. You just hear bleep bleep bleeeep bleep bleep bleep and some bleep bleep and then everyone around the character is just shocked and I&amp;#39;m just pissed. Why can I see a character get brutally killed in the most horrific way possible but not hear fuck? Why can I watch a character get sexually assaulted or even raped but as long as I don&amp;#39;t see a dick or a nipple then I&amp;#39;m good? I can watch mass genocide or listen to hate speech but can&amp;#39;t hear cunt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dumbest part of all of this is 99% of us know exactly what is being censored. It doesn&amp;#39;t actually work as censoring if your mind fills in the blanks. Sure if the screen went completely black whenever nudity or sexual content came on or you censored the whole sentence instead of just the &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; word then yeah it&amp;#39;d work but we don&amp;#39;t do that. It feels like we simply do the level of censoring we do to make the 0.001% of the population who would be lose their shit happy but why the fuck do we care what they think? They aren&amp;#39;t watching the fucking shows! No way you are a stick up the butt prude and like watching South Park and rick and morty and you draw the line at nipples and fucks. Why do we pander to the extreme minority? We could uncensore every adult program and nothing would happen and everyone who watches these programs or listens to these songs would still listen and watch and the only mad ones would be people who don&amp;#39;t even consume that media&lt;/p&gt;

What I mean is the man asking the woman out , having to plan the date, pay for it and any further other(since she will hold it againts him if he dosnt) and generally having to ,, woo her,, while she stays passive. The main reason for this post is a coment I read on one of the dating subs(looking trought the controversial section on them is a guilty pleasure when I&amp;#39;m bored). It was a woman comenthing how when a guy dosnt pay for the date he shows that he is cheap and lazy and yet saying that she never pays for a date. This really annoyed me because it really reminds me of ,, modern day femenist,,. I belive that if a woman want equality ( which everyone should want) then she must accept both the benefits and the responsibility that come with it. You cant just say well I reject the gender norms in this and this area since they hinder me but I want to keep them in this and this are since I benefit from them. If you want to be intellectually honest you either chose equality,  both the good and the bad, or choose old school. Meaning that you demand that the guys is the archetype of the old school gentleman, but you also have to be the archetype of the old school woman(staying in the house, cooking, cleaning and taking care of his sexual needs whenever he wants). Now there isnt anything wrong with either of the options( different tastes for different people) but anything in between and your just a hypocrite who wants to have their cake and eat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/SHLHkmWoYDU&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/SHLHkmWoYDU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America pretty much lost the Iraq war. Sure they got rid of Saddam, but they didnt subdue the militant Islamists and ex-Iraqi army militias at all. Once they left Isis had the strength to not only conquer large swathes of Iraq, but the middle east proper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America has 7x the population of Iraq and something like 10x the guns, plus a populace with a ludicrously high rate of firearm profficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add to that the radically different levels of desertion, and more importantly sabotage. You think fragging was bad in Nam, see what happens when you invade Texas lmfao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add to that the logistical nightmare that is protecting US infrastructure, literally 10s of millions of unguardable targets, and the whole thing starts looking unwinnable for the government very fucking fast.  US geography is also an extremely daunting challenge with regards to suppressing rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the foreign actor concern. Allies would put pressure on to stop the killing of civilians (which would be a necessary collateral outcome of fighting your own people). Enemies would gleefully support the rebels in any way they could as hard as they could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government would never fucking glass its own territory and people with nukes, its fucking ridiculous to suggest such a thing. Even conventional bombing would be asking to feed into desertion and further rebellion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to invade due to a rifle behind every blade of grass isnt just something for foreign armies to ponder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American citizens should be sickened by his words here, they are deeply unAmerican and downright terrifying to be coming from the top executive in the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus CMV:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden is straight up lying about the &amp;#39;types of weapons&amp;#39; claim, you could absolutely own cannons as a private citizen. Privateers used them all the time and 2A allowed for their legal ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tl:dr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2A practically ensures the US populace a reasonable if not favored chance against their own government. Not many countries can say that, and none of them have a military as daunting as the yanks. Biden&amp;#39;s cute little comment was pure unadulterated bluff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 1:&lt;/strong&gt; gee whiz its hard to run so many arguments at once. I should have done this with access to my pc instead of just my shitty phone with a cracked screen. I apologise to anybody left waiting, im trying to answer as quickly as possible, im literally sweating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2:&lt;/strong&gt; use of the Iraq war as example was just that. Whether that war counted as victory or defeat is not all that relevant to my opinion here, my point was just that the insurgent population was never subdued despite the overwhelming technological advantage wielded by the US military. The Taliban or viet kong might have been better to go with, but thats not exactly comparable because they are militaries themselves at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 3:&lt;/strong&gt; I will add one argument. The top US military brass have said on many occassions that they are beholden to the constitution first and foremost. I tend to take them at their word, they generally seem like very principled and proud individuals willing to do anything necessary to uphold their oath. That means the President cant just decide to glass entire cities or States that contain innocent civilians in amongst an insurgency or guerilla network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 4:&lt;/strong&gt; I think many here are failing to appreciate the ticking clock the government would be put under during a popular uprising, especially if many people stopped working and paying taxes. The US military is insanely expensive, an insurgency is very cheap. As the Taliban say: &amp;#39;you have the watches, we have the time&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

Correcting people doing an economics PhD on &amp;quot;you can&amp;#39;t say free because nothing is free&amp;quot;. A physicist on the usage of &amp;quot;weight&amp;quot;, and so on.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My view is that we should strive, in the context of a normal conversation or discussion, to be understandable by the lay public&lt;/strong&gt;, as experts in their fields should strive for us to understand. But to just &amp;quot;nitpick&amp;quot; on the fact that an expert or trained professional uses a more understandable, not perfectly accurate term, is pointless. The chances they know what they are saying are high, and that they know more than whoever is commenting even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think there is a point in such a context to do this? As it&amp;#39;s something I hear almost daily about many fields and with many colleagues from various backgrounds complaining about this, I figured I should ask myself if maybe it actually could be useful.

&lt;p&gt;First of all, if a person has the money to legally pay for a service (movies, animes, games etc) and they don&amp;#39;t do it because they think entertainment should be free, yes, then piracy can&amp;#39;t be justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also i think pirating services such as games that are made by indie companies and are available to buy for a cheap price, also can&amp;#39;t be justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, let me tell you my reasons :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reston number one: some people are poor. I have heard people say &amp;quot; WeLl iF yOu ArE pOor ThAT doEsNt jUStify sTeAling&amp;quot;, and i consider that bullshit cause, being really poor can also justify stealing in some conditions, if a homeless child steals one apple to steal alive, that isn&amp;#39;t wrong, human life values a lot more than an apple, if a person steals a loaf of bread to feed his family, it&amp;#39;s not something wrong, because again, human life values a lot more than a loaf of bread. So yes, i think stealing can be justified if the person they&amp;#39;re stealing from isn&amp;#39;t poor himself, also don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, i don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a good thing to steal but if someone&amp;#39;s life depends on it, it can be justified. And for piracy, of course someone&amp;#39;s life doesn&amp;#39;t depend on watching movies, but i think if a poor person pirates some movie, it can lead to that person support the industry when he&amp;#39;s able to, that can also lead to free marketing some people are not able to pay for entertainment and i think it&amp;#39;s OK to pirate as long as it&amp;#39;s not possible to pay, of course as long as they choose to pay when they have the ability to. And also I&amp;#39;ve heard people say &amp;quot; eNtertAinMEnt iS a LuXurY&amp;quot;, and my answer to that is, what does a rich kid do to deserve to have that luxury that a poor broke kid doesn&amp;#39;t? The answer is, nothing, it just depended on their luck. So yes i think pirating can be justified as long as the person pays for it when they can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2- legally paying for entertainment doesn&amp;#39;t always support the creators. Half the time that you buy something, the money doesn&amp;#39;t actually really go to the actual creators, usually the big company receives the money and not the actual creators. And that happens a lot especially in the Anime/manga industry. The industry has been growing, and that growth leads to more money for the creators, so why are animators still underpaid af? I think when a big company doesn&amp;#39;t pay their employees enough, they deserve their products pirated, at least until they decide to change&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3- it may be impossible to pay for entertainment. You might be confused, this is more of a personal reason but it&amp;#39;s literally impossible for people such as me to pay for entertainment legally. So let me explain, i live in Iran, and in Iran, international banking doesn&amp;#39;t exist, it&amp;#39;s not possible for an iranian person to pay for any service that&amp;#39;s outside of iran, and there&amp;#39;s no service that legally sells entertainment products like movies and animes, even the big streaming services pirate their stuff, so yeah it&amp;#39;s impossible for me to pay for something like Netflix. Also most of the entertainment services have banned iran, so doesn&amp;#39;t that mean they don&amp;#39;t want our money? And also it is possible to buy games, but they are so expensive that it&amp;#39;s possible to pay the rent with the money &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m going to say, i might be a bit biased, keep in mind that these are my opinions and i don&amp;#39;t count them as objective facts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, social media has been a horrific accelerator of humankind&amp;#39;s worst tendecies, and is toxifying our society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic judgments, superficial lies, and echo chambers of misinformation have amplified our negativity, as well as distracted many Americans and other members of industrial societies from real crises like Climate Change, World Hunger, Global Peace, or Social Justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean is, people online are nasty &amp;amp; carry that nastiness into real life. If you aren&amp;#39;t pretty, funny, or witty, no one values you in the digital world &amp;amp; the culture of people who learn this way likewise treat you cruelly in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more scary, actual life-or-death needs are tragically ignored by bad info on FaceBook, InstaGram, Twitter, or even Reddit etc. We see vaccine lies lead to people dying ; we also see violent white supremacists organize domestic terror ; and we see junk science like alternate &amp;quot;climate&amp;quot; hypotheses spread as though they&amp;#39;re scientific theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with so much global ugliness emanating from online, what good is there to the tech of social media?&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not saying it ‘should’ be socially acceptable, I’m saying that I believe it is currently (subconsciously) accepted, and it shouldn’t be. I’m asking you to convince me that it is not socially accepted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before anyone misinterprets this, this does not mean that other races and nationalities do not face racism and discrimination. I know that they face it much worse than whites and Americans, and I understand systematic racism and white privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is that if you were to make a negative remark about a white person, it is not socially frowned upon. And that same remark made by a white person towards any person who isn’t white would have you labeled a racist. I’ll give an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White person recommends going to a bar that is predominantly white. Response is “I don’t really want to be around that many white people haha”. Socially acceptable, even possibly a joke. No outrage. If it’s reversed and the comment is “I don’t really want to be around that many black people haha”. You are a racist, and a comment like that would destroy relationships. Replace black with literally any other race, and the comment is equally as racist, but made towards a white it’s like whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen the term “wypipo” for white people. No one says it’s racist, it just is what it is. If white people had a nickname for black people that black people did not like, you would be shunned for using it. Something like “they don’t like being called that, so stop”. But if white people don’t like being called wypipo? Doesn’t seem like it matters…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example about Americans. (Living as an American in another country has made me realise this over and over again, it never ends). A comment overheard in public “Americans are so annoying”. Everyone supports it (except for Americans of course), but the response is not “Wow that was actually racist”. Everyone openly agrees, it’s socially acceptable. Even if they don’t agree, you aren’t shunned for it. Same comment but replace Americans with literally any other nationality. “Japanese people are so annoying”, heads would turn and you’d be labeled a racist instantly, and rightfully so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: previous examples are xenophobic , not racist, but same idea of the discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been afraid to discuss this sentiment among peers, so before you change my view, can you please also let me know if I’m way out of line, or if it has some merit of truth, but the discussion itself may not even be socially acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: also to be clear, I don’t think that people are ‘intentionally’ accepting of this, it seems like more of a subconscious thing, not realising that there is anything wrong with being said&lt;/p&gt;

While I can understand this reasoning for many of the existing cultures that had their artifacts taken in recent memory, my primary contention with this for Egypt specifically is that they&amp;#39;re incredibly old. The Egyptians that created these artifacts and all their ancestors are long dead, and the people and government that currently live in Egypt are just the conquerors of the conquerors of the conquerors of the people who did create this artifacts. The British and others took these artifacts from the people who took them from the people who took them from the people who lived there thousands of years ago, their claim doesn&amp;#39;t really seem any less reasonable than those of the current Egyptian people or government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I don&amp;#39;t really believe these artifacts should sit concentrated at a few European museums either, I believe when it comes to things this old they should be considered to be part of our shared heritage as a species and should be equally distributed around the world to all stable countries that could reasonable house them (I could make another argument about how Egypt is not the best place for these artifacts on the basis of the instability of the government alone), so that as many people as possible could see them.&lt;/p&gt;

And any political viewpoint will look insane when taken to its logical extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At it&amp;#39;s most basic form, a libertarian believes that a person or group of people in government are not capable of knowing what&amp;#39;s best for me as an individual, or you as an individual. This is at it&amp;#39;s worse at the federal level, and gets slightly better as government gets more local.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a libertarian wants to reduce the power of government to &lt;strong&gt;only what&amp;#39;s necessary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is where individual libertarians would have discussions and debate, around what is necessary and what is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a libertarian could absolutely be for universal healthcare. They might compare what we pay right now on average to the NHS, and see that we actually pay more than they do. Then there could be a discussion that the free market isn&amp;#39;t working right with healthcare because people don&amp;#39;t know what they will pay for the service, and the service is often times non-optional. Thus, it is necessary for the government to fund healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think where leftists and libertarians most often disagree is actually around the framing of the discussion. If the subject is social safety nets for example, the leftist will enter the conversation on the assumption that government is the one and only option for providing help to those that need it. The libertarian does not enter the conversation with this assumption. So the conversation is doomed from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They aren&amp;#39;t disagreeing about helping people, they are disagreeing about the method of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my view is that libertarianism isn&amp;#39;t any more or less crazy than conservatism or liberalism. Both of the latter philosophies wish to use the government to enforce their views, while libertarianism does not. I don&amp;#39;t find that to be an unreasonable political philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

That said, I have a pretty privileged background and none of these issues have impacted my life directly, so I will definitely have pretty big gaps in my understanding. I have made what I think is an honest effort to understand both sides of this debate (which seems to have been set off by a couple recent reddit/twitter posts and the Oli London video), and I feel like I&amp;#39;m reaching a completely different conclusion to the people close to me (and online) that I tend to agree with, so I want to challenge my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general I am 100% fine with people being cisgender, transgender, non-binary, gender-fluid, transsexual, or whatever else as long as they are doing it in good faith.* Not everybody thinks this way, obviously, so we have this big cultural change underway as people come to grips with gender identity.  Big cultural shifts tend to create really challenging social/cultural knock-on effects. In my mind, this question about racial identity and being transracial is one of them. I don&amp;#39;t think there are easy answers for a lot of these questions, but I think we owe it to eachother to listen, explore, communicate, and compromise. The conversations that I&amp;#39;ve seen so far on the topic of racial identity are far from honest, with arguments like: &amp;quot;Gender dysphoria is a part of psychology [and racial dysphoria isn&amp;#39;t]&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called_it/h3daui1?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3&quot;&gt;0&lt;/a&gt; (Gender dysphoria wasn&amp;#39;t either, 50 years ago); &amp;quot;Culture and heritage however is lived through communities. It can be  appropriated and abused. A white British person claiming to be  trans-Korean diminishes the experiences and burdens of actual Korean people and communities.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called_it/h3dc4wt?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; (Gender has a massive cultural component), &amp;quot;Race and Ethnicity is Rooted in Ancestry… You Can’t Just Pick and Choose&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/verve-up/transracial-is-not-the-new-transgender-why-race-and-gender-are-not-synonymous-b2c688ef0fae&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; (sounds a lot like the &amp;#39;gender is rooted in biology&amp;#39; argument to me) and &amp;quot;We also think that, as a result of this asymmetry, transgender identities deserve social uptake and so-called “transracial”  identifications as Black almost always do not. (We leave space for  unique circumstances in which someone who has deeply invested in a Black community and been forthcoming about their racial history is nevertheless accepted within that community as Black.)&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bostonreview.net/race-philosophy-religion-gender-sexuality/robin-dembroff-dee-payton-why-we-shouldnt-compare&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/16/transracial-definition-destructive-rachel-dolezal-spokane-naacp&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; (there&amp;#39;s obviously massive differences, but this argument isn&amp;#39;t fundamentally different to arguing that trans women aren&amp;#39;t women because they haven&amp;#39;t grown up having periods, experiencing sexism, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting aside (for now) the existing use of &amp;#39;transracial&amp;#39; used in the context of adopted children raised outside of their biological parents&amp;#39; ethnic/racial cultures, I think that being transracial is similar in a lot of ways to being transgender or transexual, and I don&amp;#39;t see how that de-legitimizes either of those things. I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of fear on the left that this comparison makes the transgender/transsexual struggle look somehow ridiculous or absurd by association &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called_it/&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; and I guess I can see why people might think that, but it feels like either an unhelpful gut reaction, or (being a bit pessimistic) an overly political/strategic reaction which looks a lot like &lt;a href=&quot;https://thomasnastcartoons.com/2015/01/06/throwing-down-the-ladder-by-which-they-rose-23-july-1870/&quot;&gt;throwing the ladder down&lt;/a&gt;. Every new cultural idea is uncomfortable at first, but we don&amp;#39;t know if it has any merit if we don&amp;#39;t explore it in good faith. I think it&amp;#39;s also a missed opportunity to better understand trans/identity in general&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the other (original) definition of transracial -- adopted children raised outside their biological parents&amp;#39; culture/race -- I think it&amp;#39;s a really interesting bridge between transsexual identity politics and transracial (the other/new definition) identity politics, because there are hundreds of thousands of cases of transracial adoption, and I&amp;#39;m sure we could learn a lot about culture and identity if we asked them about it.  I expect some of these children experience very real, very complicated dysphoria [citation needed, obviously].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if the likes of Rachel Dolezal, Oli London, Ja Du, Ekundayo, etc are charlatans or people in genuine turmoil deserving of, if not our sympathy, at least our patience. What I do know is that this kind of tectonic cultural shift has happened enough times throughout history that I think I want to hedge my bets and at least be kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Quick aside:  I don&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;as long as it isn&amp;#39;t hurting anyone&amp;quot; because I&amp;#39;ve observed that change hurts, and a lot of people are experiencing real pain caused by this big cultural shift in favor of trans rights and that&amp;#39;s unavoidable. However, I think there will always be charlatans out there who take advantage of the opportunity that any big disruption creates, so that&amp;#39;s why I say &amp;#39;in good faith&amp;#39;. You can pick your example of this, from people &amp;#39;playing the race card&amp;#39; to children setting their screen names to &amp;#39;Connecting...&amp;#39; to get out of zoom/skype classes during a pandemic. Big changes create opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then the question becomes what IS the maximum duration of lockdown that is justified even if scientifically established to save lives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a meaningful difference between &amp;quot;permanent&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;indefinite&amp;quot;? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that some maximal threshold should be debated and agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;

Politicians are throwing numbers around left and right. After the debate is over you have another 30-45 minutes of programming dedicated to fact-checking what they said, again without any sources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a political debate, politicians should be allowed to prepare a presentation for each of the big questions that are released beforehand. These should be backed up by easily accessible sources, so that the viewers can verify the claims if they want to, while they are watching the debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it goes into the shorter rapid-fire debates between two candidates this obviously isn&amp;#39;t feasible. Instead, I feel like the respective campaigns should be forced to put out a statement afterward citing sources for as many of the points their candidate made as is possible. If they said something that can&amp;#39;t be backed up, then they issue an apology and a clarification. This would preferably be done at the next debate or some other televised event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that this is far from perfect and that it&amp;#39;s possible to find sources supporting most opinions. However, politicians have been known to just spout random &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; that are later proven false. I think this would go a small way to deter this type of behavior, without decreasing the viewability or essence of a political debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT… I do strongly believe that the connection between how you feel (your energy, outlook, emotions, cognition, decision making abilities) is not brought to the forefront of solving issues like depression, unproductiveness, and aggression like it should. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody is willing to acknowledge that diet and sleep have profound effects on health but very few seem to actually realise it and apply it to themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often than not I feel as though that ‘tiring job’ or ‘draining relationship’ is more a result of a poor diet and sleep regime than it is actual social interactions having an effect. No, you are not tired on Saturday because you ‘just finished an exhausting work week’, you are tired because you eat and sleep like shit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, hormones can be influenced by social interactions, but over a long period of time I see their effects as minimal in comparison to a good regime. (I’m saying this to attribute more of the effect to diet and sleep, I’m not saying that severe events like a loved one’s passing can’t sometimes overpower the effects of diet and sleep). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind you, I’m in the prime of my life physically and I don’t expect the entire population to have my level of energy or sharpness so I realise my bias, but I don’t think people without prexisting conditions are doomed to things like midday lethargy and morning grogginess. On a good day of eating and sleeping I have energy throughout and feel cognitively present at all times, regardless of my social context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, also, what is with normalising things like lethargy, headaches, and brain fog?? I constantly see people accept things like post-meal lethargy as concrete and unchangeable. People literally plan their days around when they’ll be lethargic instead of actually trying to fix the problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me started on the neurodepressive effects of eating and sleeping like garbage. Not saying all cases of depression can be solved with those two things alone, but they can certainly be greatly ameliorated by them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realisation translates into action. 2/3rds of the American popular is overweight, if that doesn’t show that this isn’t an unpopular sentiment I don’t know what does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think? Kick me down a peg I’ve been lurking pubmed and NCBI for too long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also this isn’t intended to invalidate other aspects of self care)&lt;/p&gt;
