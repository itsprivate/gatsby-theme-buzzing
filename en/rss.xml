&lt;li&gt;My main problem is not with the purpose of the income tax, but rather &lt;strong&gt;how overwhelming the tax burden lies on the middle and upper middle class relative to that of corporations.&lt;/strong&gt; Effective tax rates as of right now in the United States would have typical corporations paying around the low 20&amp;#39;s%; loopholes in the accounting system for depreciating assets and stock options permit their actual payment to be well under their &amp;quot;fair worth&amp;quot;. Meanwhile, an employed American who has an income somewhere around the middle class can expect 30% or more of their paycheck to be gone. Corporations, who only exist to feed investors, are paying lower effective rates than typical employees who have kids to feed or people to guard. &lt;strong&gt;After being so responsible for the tax burden already, why raise income tax even more?&lt;/strong&gt; I could be missing something in this picture but, to me, it looks like a simple case of flipping the tax burden onto corporations instead of raising income tax even further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second issue; &lt;strong&gt;raising the income tax&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;even further&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;as a way of fighting income inequality perpetuates the economic fallacy that high salary = wealth.&lt;/strong&gt; The signifier for wealth is &lt;strong&gt;net worth, NOT how much you make today.&lt;/strong&gt; The young new lawyer, doctor, or pharmacist who has 6 figure loan balances and is only their first year out making big bucks is far poorer than the engineer whose been working since college. Several traditional  professions with those sweet salaries are incredibly misleading for the actual entry cost they demanded, and just because you command a mid 6 figure income after many years doesn&amp;#39;t mean &lt;em&gt;poof, a Lamborghini and mansion appears and you&amp;#39;re not paying your fair dues to society&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#39;m not saying we should base the tax system on asset allocation, but I&amp;#39;m just asking people to get this false equation of high salary = wealth out of their head. &lt;strong&gt;This way any politician who campaigns for a movement on behalf of the economic &amp;quot;common man&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t come for your paychecks and understands that one&amp;#39;s salary doesn&amp;#39;t imply they&amp;#39;re rich and hoarding from society.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Politicians know this is the case but they&amp;#39;re so in bed with corporations anyway; we as voters need a way to fight this by knowing more about how dumb the income tax is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The villains of wealth inequality and abysmal tax allocation in the US are equity owners in corporations. Come for their necks, not the broke pharmacist who works at your CVS. Go for the corporations and I guarantee you, even the slightest percentage point enforced properly (without those loopholes) will lead to millions in tax revenue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Now... to get the feds to properly &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; the money? That&amp;#39;s a whole other thing.&lt;/p&gt;

For example normal store fronts would have you purchase a product, take if home, find out it’s defective and rather than offering an exchange, they would ask you to deal remotely with the manufacturer resulting in 3 hour+ hold times and numerous months for replacement which still had to be shipped to store fronts. This is just a common example I’ve seen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covid is coming to a close and companies are still practicing this level of laziness. I think the new normal is going to be garbage customer service and sky high prices. We have nobody to blame but ourselves and we should have driven the offending businesses out of business for such practices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you yourself have any examples of this please speak up because I’m struggling to recall every example I’ve seen since March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

This belief has been mounting for a while, but I&amp;#39;ll admit that the impetus for this post is somewhat reactive. I just saw a NYT article summary that read, &amp;quot;I Am Always Out of My Lane: The debate on reopening schools was toxic. Just ask Emily Oster, an economist who . . .&amp;quot; I think this sucks, for numerous reasons. First, I don&amp;#39;t like seeing journalistic language cheapen itself at the same pace as low-value Twitter discourse. But more importantly, to me, a term like &amp;quot;toxic&amp;quot; generally insinuates a lot about systemic and cultural malfeasance within an organization or group, but is just as often lazily used as a synonym for &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; that allows people to draw &lt;em&gt;inferences&lt;/em&gt; about bigotry, sexism, or some other systemic malfeasance without any offer of proof. In this headline, it&amp;#39;s basically just meaningless and annoying to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we do see it all the time with more harmful consequences. &amp;quot;The office culture there is toxic&amp;quot; is a phrase someone might use when describing burnout, overtime, and other labor abuses in an industry. By using a term like &amp;quot;toxic&amp;quot; they allow listeners to think the worst of the worst about the culture--that it&amp;#39;s prejudiced, that the leaders are unrepentant bigots, etc.--with plausible deniability, because no slanderous accusations about bigotry were &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; made. This is dangerous, because we see more and more that people are ready and eager to out each other as nonspecifically &amp;quot;problematic&amp;quot; in the never-ending game of mutually assured reputational destruction over nothing but vague allegations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this phenomenon is something that needs to be recognized so we can begin the disarmament process, and not allow people to get away with implying the worst about others while putting very little on the line, in terms of their own future trustworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;

However, if I decided I should change, then I would begin to beat myself up about it and start getting upset. Since this is something that you can’t change, it’s more of an intrinsic belief*, I don’t see a benefit to doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Ok, this was fun. I’m going to sleep now. My takeaways are that the person might not be able to always think through the situation in time, and the method might not be very good for practising in the real world. I’ll check back in the morning, but I would also like to apologise before I go. I think I formatted the post pretty badly, as well as getting sucked into a tangent argument, meaning that I didn’t get my point across very well, and then reinforced the wrong point in the comments. By this stage, it’s a bit late to fix, but I should have focused more on the hypothetical ethics rather than the actual feasibility of doing this. If you still want to reply whilst I’m asleep, please focus on the ethics. Should the person be penalised for holding the views if they don’t matter?&lt;/p&gt;

Of course it seems like a sale if an item is $800 instead of $1500, but the original price listed often not even what the item is really worth. And as with Black Friday plenty of products that are listed on sale are the cheaper version of something, or a model that will soon be discontinued to make way for the newer model of the product. Many TVs bought on Black Friday would often end up broken sooner rather than later because they were never instead to last unbeknownst to the consumer who just saw a huge screen size TV for a lower than usual price. And because so many companies decided to have &amp;quot;Black Friday&amp;quot; multiple times a year, it gives more of a unique advantage to Amazon since if something actually is just only a couple a days and you know you won&amp;#39;t see those &amp;quot;deals&amp;quot; again there is more of an urgency to the situation and more pressure for customers to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer scam is just a vague way to attempt to describe it, but if you don&amp;#39;t quite understand what I mean by it, refer to the way people say you should avoid going out to spend money on Black Friday and why they say that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, you can be homophobic and not-gay. That seems logical, for whatever reason, you don&amp;#39;t like gay people, doesn&amp;#39;t mean that I will agree with you or your view, but, if you don&amp;#39;t hurt anyone with your idea and principles or even reduce the rights of other people, I won&amp;#39;t have an issue with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if homophobic people are closeted gays that implies that they are worse than non-gay when it comes to tolerance of sexual preferences, since they hate themselves and people like them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thirdly, let&amp;#39;s say that you are homophobic and not gay. Do you think being called a closeted gay makes you feel better about the LGBT cause? Wouldn&amp;#39;t it make you feel even worse and hate them even more? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t see how you can portray this as something that should use to criticize others. I find it an extremely bad argument and doesn&amp;#39;t help absolutely anyone, it doesn&amp;#39;t help the cause for gay (LGBT) rights or helps others being more tolerant to each other preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to discuss this with you since I don&amp;#39;t see any point that makes this argument favourable to anybody.&lt;/p&gt;

Clearly using a costume to mock a certain culture, such as blackface or dressing up as an indigenous person as a Halloween costume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it promotes the kind of racial segregation so many have worked so hard to abolish. For example, saying a white person should not wear dreads, at the root of it, displays the same overall thinking pattern as when people wanted a pool drained because one black person swam in it. People try to act like they&amp;#39;re all woke when they whine about most instances of things they think are cultural appropriation by saying that they&amp;#39;re protecting marginalized communities by some rationale of righting past wrongs done by the ancestors of those in not so marginalized groups and somehow evening the playing field. The fact that white people are seen differently with dreads than black people, a common argument in favor of the modern paradigm of avoiding what some call cultural appropriation, is not going to be solved by saying white people should not have them. It&amp;#39;s just going to promote that black and white people are more different than they really are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all really comes down to a thought process along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This thing belongs to my group. You&amp;#39;re not in my group, so you can&amp;#39;t participate in this thing that is for my people and my people alone. If you try, I feel threatened and scared, because you&amp;#39;re different and foreign invaders into our traditions and property must be stopped.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically marginalized or not, left or right wing, most people have a tendency to try and think this way in some fashion or another, with the only difference a lot of the time being the way that thinking is packaged and worded, and it leads to a lot of unnecessary violence, stress, and strife.&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand he worked really hard and somehow he isnt broke, so i want to understand how you guys think about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 1) Since I got this reply a lot, you guys are right with the low cost per Kilogramm to Orbit. 
I decided to not take on this Argument since SpaceX later on got heavily funded by NASA (after they invented the falcon 1 , merlin, Kestrel, and Draco engines).
I must confess i dont know if they still get an extra amount of money per launch like they used to get( at least i think they did), so probably the cost per Kilogramm would be much higher if they had higher Research expenses.
 Also i know that getting funded is not unusal, in my opinion it just doesnt Match the whole &amp;quot; we /I did it also by myself&amp;quot; image&lt;/p&gt;

As soon as that happens, all bets are off, no one from that point on sees it as their responsibility for cleaning the seat or bothering to even lift it. So it just gets more and more disgusting and piss-covered until some poor sap who actually needs to take a shit get&amp;#39;s to play janitor for the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire history of the public toilet has taught us that we can&amp;#39;t rely on people to treat the utilities with any sort of respect. It only takes one person to throw the entire system into a disgusting chaos. So why do we continue to trust the system to the personal responsibility of the masses? It would be very easy to have a spring loaded toilet seat that physically required someone to be sitting on it in order to remain in the seated position. Anyone using the toilet to urinate would always enter a stall with the seat already up and out of the splash zone. The only time the seat would be exposed would be when someone intended to use it in the seated position.  &lt;/p&gt;

Aside from occasionally seeing it in a few public restrooms, as relayed by some users in the comments below, I&amp;#39;m including this YouTube video that should more clearly demonstrate what I&amp;#39;m talking about.

And this comes from days before the current pandemic, so its not the cause either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, putting aside very narrow ultraspecialized fields or very small/closed countries, I think that&amp;#39;s just a whole lot of bollocks. I&amp;#39;ll give two examples I know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Friend of mine applied to work to stack the shelves at a supermarket. She was 100% happy to earn any wage at all, and willing to work any schedule as she lived close-by. She was turned down (nothing bad there, of course, it&amp;#39;s life). However couple days down the road I got wind through contacts that this manager was complaining &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t hire anyone anymore, young people just don&amp;#39;t want to work&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the thing, during the crisis years, 2010-2017, young people got shafted hard, and instances of unpaid wage, paid below agreed upon value, unpaid work-time, and so on, became extremely common, with traditional legal solution proving almost ineffective. As a result, nowadays anyone with some education, basic knowledge of the law and a few contacts and favors (which are cheap enough) can defend themselves. And if that doesn&amp;#39;t work... well, other ways do. So what hiring managers target for unqualified position are people that will not know HOW to defend themselves, that don&amp;#39;t have contacts and friends to pull from, and so on. Essentially people that will just shrug and say &amp;quot;well, I got shafted a month wage, it&amp;#39;s life&amp;quot; if at some point that don&amp;#39;t pay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- I worked construction for a few years, a few month here, a week there, in between classes, etc. Earned about 2000-4000€/y doing that. Recently got many calls to come back, and they were offering about 5k-6k/y. Comparatively sweet. However, I finished my degree and got a more regular job, earning about 75k/y at the moment. Well, most of the companies manager I talked to were downright rude when I said &amp;quot;I earn X atm, can you do better?&amp;quot;. In fact one company I talked with went on the local news and complained that people just &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t want to work anymore&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;young people are freeloader, can&amp;#39;t hire anyone&amp;quot;. Nah mate, you&amp;#39;re just paying shit wage. This worked 5-10y ago. But nowadays the economy is better, unemployment is way down and so on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s not that there aren&amp;#39;t people to hire. Even very specific experts, you can almost always pay extra and they&amp;#39;ll come from further in the region. It&amp;#39;s that people got wise to the crisis-era tricks, and that you want to pay 2013 wages in a 2019 economy. You can&amp;#39;t hire or retain people because you give shitty conditions and nowadays people have alternatives. Simple as. And yeah, brain-drain is a thing, because you pay poorly. Pay more, retain the brains. It&amp;#39;s not rocket-science.&lt;/p&gt;

The first type is just cancelling someone from the platform where they committed egregious behavior on. If you act like a piece of shit at a bar, the bar can cancel you from stepping foot in their business in the future. If you are harassing people and being racist on Twitter, Twitter can ban you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second type of cancel culture is advocating for the person&amp;#39;s cancellation outside of just the platform where they committed egregious behavior. I&amp;#39;ve seen people go as far as getting people fired from their jobs, getting people kicked out of college, getting people evicted, etc. This is the type of cancel culture that I am focusing on in my CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I would consider myself on the left politically. However, I am against the left&amp;#39;s embrace of this second type of cancel culture because I find it very hypocritical. How can you on the one hand laugh at someone for losing their job for saying something racist or insensitive online, then on the other hand advocate for a more rehabilitative justice system where even murderers should have a path towards redemption and a normal life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see this all the time where the same people that ridicule a white person for getting fired from their job or kicked out of college will go around saying that a black guy involved in gang violence should be offered rehabilitation. Either both should be extended a path to redeem themselves, or both should be subject to retributive justice. Having one position for one type of person and another position for another shows that you are ideologically motivated, have no principles, and are hypocritical. CMV&lt;/p&gt;

Like--it&amp;#39;s not substantially more work for the server to bring you a sixty dollar bottle of wine than a five dollar shot, so why would the former substantially increase how much they get paid and the latter have a negligible impact? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What i&amp;#39;m proposing is that you should work out an amount of money that you typically tip that more-or-less equals the average dollar amount you&amp;#39;d be tipping on meals, and use that as the baseline rather than 15%. Like if your meals on average cost around 30$, you should have a baseline tip of 5$ whether you&amp;#39;re getting a 15$ meal or a 45$ meal. (That&amp;#39;s if we accept that 15% is an appropriate baseline tip--i know there&amp;#39;s a push in some areas for that to be higher. i don&amp;#39;t have a strong opinion either way but am probably vaguely supportive of people tipping more if they can afford it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might still have reasons to adjust that tip up or down. I don&amp;#39;t necessarily think you should always pay servers the same--if you&amp;#39;re staying for a long time, or having multiple courses, or have a large/disruptive party, or are going to a place with very good service or strict regulations about how the servers can act, i think those factors should increase how much you tip. And some of them are loosely correlated with expense--but I don&amp;#39;t think that correlation is strong enough to really justify using expense as a proxy instead of tipping more specifically when those factors apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages of this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-increased income stability for waiters. it&amp;#39;s still contingent on how many tables you get and whether they&amp;#39;re generous tippers or not, so hardly ideal, but now at least it&amp;#39;s not about whether the table ordered a 100$ bottle of wine or a 20$ round of shots&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-more equal for waiters at cheap places. it doesn&amp;#39;t seem right that waiting at a place with high prices is a way better-paying job than waiting at a place with low prices, all else being equal. it&amp;#39;s possible that the place with high prices is a more demanding job, but it&amp;#39;s also totally possible that it isn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-doesn&amp;#39;t require constant recalculation. You&amp;#39;ll probably only need to work out how much you should be tipping every few years as your income changes and you start being able to spend more--the rest of the time you can just give a steady dollar amount, with more for good service. Obviously I don&amp;#39;t expect you to exactly calculate the average, just give a good enough estimate that you probably aren&amp;#39;t paying less than you otherwise would overall. This is a comparatively minor issue but, well, rule of threes y&amp;#39;know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real problem with this that I&amp;#39;ve been able to see is that it bucks social convention so you&amp;#39;d seem like a dick whenever you get an expensive meal and leave a comparatively small tip, even if you&amp;#39;re actually being more fair overall. But it doesn&amp;#39;t seem right to continue tipping unfairly just to look good/fit with social norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, i&amp;#39;m also down for abolishing tipping as a practice, but what I&amp;#39;m proposing here is more of a best-practices when you go to a restaurant--I think it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious that the way to get rid of tipping is to put pressure on the restaurant owners, not to screw over the wait staff. (Not very interested in debating this part of the post though)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start off by saying I do not think the girl with down syndrome should be excluded from the yearbook photo for her perspective squad. If she didn&amp;#39;t make varsity and was on the backup squad then her photo should be on the squad that her skills allowed her to participate at. Which it seems is what happened from the article. But if she couldn&amp;#39;t do the moves required to be varsity or on any squad then they gave her a nice photo to keep for memories and published the varsity only photo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the author goes on to describe his special needs son and how he was &amp;quot;discriminated&amp;quot; against. Like being in choir but he likes to dance and move around while the choir that practiced hard to create a show for their families has the spotlight stolen by a distraction. He says they allowed him on stage for a couple of songs but then he was told to come off stage. Which seems completely reasonable. At some point the show should be about the kids that have practiced for months and not the disabled kid dancing with a choir in the background. When are the able bodied kid&amp;#39;s parents allowed to snap their photos for their memories if your son is not participating in line with everyone else? He even goes on to say his son is a non speaking autistic boy so he literally could not participate correctly and they still included him in a program about singing. He also states his sons dancing is a delight to all the audience members and only the teacher saw a problem with it. What a big assumption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also implies disabled children should be allowed to compete in competitive sports. So how does that go? Hey we are putting in our disabled kid as defensive line can you tell everyone not to try their best so we can give him some feel good memories? Hey we are putting our disabled kid in as pitcher because he really likes throwing the ball can you not smash a homer on him? At what point is hindering 60 other people&amp;#39;s time so that your child can be in the spotlight enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter currently has 3 disabled children in her 8th grade classes. She says you can tell right away because they have a helper with them at all times and her classes are being constantly disrupted by the special needs kid&amp;#39;s. She has had her hair pulled by a disabled kid. Saw two disabled kids stabbing each other with pencils to the point a resource officer had to be stationed in her math class the remainder of the year. And even has one disabled kid who soils himself and doesn&amp;#39;t shower in 3 of her classes which heavily disrupts her ability to learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe inclusion ends where other kids progress and hard work is being undermined. The people with disabled children seem not to care about the disruptions as long as their child gets to pretend they are normal; while my daughter has to compete in the real world where her grades and extracurriculars matter for her future. Does hurting 26 other kids future outweigh helping one disabled kid do slightly better in class? I do not believe so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom, aunt and cousin have been teaching for 20 years or more each and all of them say that teaching with 29 kids and 1 or 2 disabled kids is damn near impossible. The normal class was already challenging. Now tell kids that they have one period  to take a test while one kid screams every couple of minutes and is actively fighting his para. Tell the kids they have to get over the unrelenting smell of teenage bo and poop in their pants and just focus on taking their itbs test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its not ableist to exclude disruptive kids from what an entire group is doing if they cannot participate properly. Its disableist to believe that your special needs child trumps everyone else&amp;#39;s experiences and hardwork because you think they deserve it regardless of those other children and their parents feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the “arguments” against this that I’ve heard are “But (country) has problems with &lt;strong&gt;x, y, and z.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can love your country but still dislike parts of it, just the same way you can love people and dislike things they do. Nothing is perfect. Something doesn’t have to be near-perfect for it to be enjoyed or loved, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take America for example. This is where many more people will disagree with me: I love America. I love living here. I hate many aspects about it, but I love many aspects about it. I hate that for the longest time there’s been problems &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;that I can’t say due to this sub’s filters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I like that we’ve gotten &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; in the sense of abolishing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ownership of others&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, legalizing same-sex marriage, getting closer and closer to equal rights for all. There’s still lots of room for improvement, but I won’t hatefully undermine the positive changes over time due to some anti-American bias lots of people seem to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no problem with others hating countries for legitimate reasons, don’t get me wrong. I dislike countries that behead women for standing against inequality, or slaughter their people for having opinions, and other insane reasons. That being said if you hate people for loving their country, even if they are relatively quiet about it/keep it to themself, you’re an asshole. You’re allowed to, but you’re still an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berating/silencing people for having different opinions is exactly what we’ve been trying to move away from. At least I thought for years that was the goal. I’m seeing the very people who fought for a voice, silencing others. Most of the time when someone mentions anything positive about certain countries, like America again, someone will just show up with “yeah sure, but what about (bad thing)?” and insult the person simply for implying there was anything good about the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly want to know why it’s considered so bad to enjoy, like, or love your country, even if you recognize it’s faults. I don’t understand this. If someone wants to help me understand, please, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People of reddit were correct, the title needed a rehash&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the era of polarizing politics, and the ability to more thoroughly vet your colleagues before allowing them into your &amp;#39;inner circle of friends,&amp;#39; I&amp;#39;ve come to notice that cliques of people will almost always politically lean in the same direction and with similar intensity. This is on top of liking the same foods, activities, games, and lifestyles. I personally find these interactions un-enriching, and as an echo-chamber just affirming one&amp;#39;s lifestyle and thoughts, be them good or bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my most central friend&amp;#39;s group: the common denominator is that we like cars, except no two of us drive the same manufacturer. Also, no one holds any disparaging views towards any one demographic, so it isn&amp;#39;t like any of the &amp;quot;-isms&amp;quot; are at play here. That aside, our political leanings and affiliations are different and we value differing public policies, drug usage varies from straight edge to daily, we all preside at different economic levels, and our religious identities are all different as well. As a result we talk about these different attributes to varying degrees but there&amp;#39;s always respect so a discussion never devolves into argument. I&amp;#39;m not only critical of their beliefs but I&amp;#39;m forced to be critical of my own. In all, I prefer friends I don&amp;#39;t necessarily agree with because &lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; my own beliefs are better thought out, &lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; hearing differing thoughts and foreign facts keeps conversation fresh, and &lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; the interaction feels more genuine than ass-kissing and there&amp;#39;s no fear of being marginalized with a fringe opinion. In all, 1-3 are cause for a quality friendship which stems from disagreement without conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCP has articulated their vision in a 100 year plan for decades now, and part of it is global supremacy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen it with Hong Kong, Tibet, Taiwan and Uyghars it’s all part of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, they’ve been colonizing Africa to mine for rare earth metals. This global chip shortage is forcing the entire world to be reliant on China because almost no countries are self-reliant when it comes to sourcing and manufacturing hardware technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads me to the scariest point: impunity. Whether or not you believe that the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus Lab was the source of COVID-19, you would be silly to believe it wasn’t fishy. Scientists were silenced, borders were closed. One would believe it was intentional, which means they know they’re immune to critique. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in conclusion, CCP is the biggest threat worldwide to freedom, safety, and even health of the earth (largest contributor to CO2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any reasonably controllable variables that we should fear more than the CCP?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s imperative, now more than ever to be extremely skeptical of any ad that finds its way to your online experience.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And something else that&amp;#39;s been on the rise is the &amp;quot;badass&amp;quot; female protaganist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;badass&amp;quot; introduction has always been quite problematic, and I&amp;#39;ll get into a specific example soon enough, it&amp;#39;s usually a small clip or monologue where a character tries to get the audience in awe of them. Typically, it goes overboard and sounds edgy as hell, and the audience loses all respect for the character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thankfully, we&amp;#39;ve seen a decrease of it, until recently, where we&amp;#39;re trying to get female protaganists to seem more badass, and as a result, making them seem shallow, insecure and unlikeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a specific example from a show on Netflix called Ragnarok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Badass&amp;quot; woman who has god-like powers comes to a martial arts gym, finds a man who&amp;#39;s practicing his wrestling, challenges him unprovoked. He looks at how small she is, and asks if she&amp;#39;s sure about it. They start to spar and the man doesn&amp;#39;t throw any hard punches until she yells at him to &amp;quot;show some respect&amp;quot; and proceeds to use her god-like powers to completely humiliate the guy, while blasting some &amp;quot;badass&amp;quot; music, and wearing a massive grin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, completely disastrous to audience in terms of respecting her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Why is a literal god wasting her time challenging random mortals that she knows she can beat without breaking a sweat within a fraction of a second?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from being pointless, it comes across as extremely insecure. What is she trying to prove?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A literal god came in the form of a petite woman just to kick some poor random mortal&amp;#39;s ass?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s like me, a fully grown man, going to a toddler who&amp;#39;s practicing karate at age 3, and beating the kid onto the ground.  Then strutting around like I was an &amp;quot;Alpha Male&amp;quot; for doing so, and being like &amp;quot;Hah! I didn&amp;#39;t even need to learn Karate to beat this kid! I&amp;#39;m so good!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this has pretty much become a universal thing in &amp;quot;badass women&amp;quot; films. It manages to be cringier than watching those &amp;quot;alpha men&amp;quot; somehow takeout an entire battalion of enemy soldiers who apparently don&amp;#39;t know how to shoot their weapon or attack at the same time instead of one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally the only message I can even concieve for these &amp;quot;badass intros&amp;quot; are &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t Judge a Book by it&amp;#39;s Cover&amp;quot;. In other words, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t assume this petite small woman with no visible muscle mass or weight could suffer serious injury if you (a trained wrestler) use all your brute force because she could secretly be an almighty god of nordic origin&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow Audiences don&amp;#39;t relate to that message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be a farfetched theory, but I think these attempts, are a result of a misunderstanding of how males organize themselves in hierarchies. Forceful Subjagation (Bullying) isn&amp;#39;t an effective means of rising in the hierarchy or getting respect, no man goes to another man, beats him into a pulp, and then earns the total respect and loyalty of the beaten and now submissive man. In fact, that&amp;#39;s a sure fire way of making enemies, losing friends, and being knocked down to the bottom of the hierarchy by a better man. Such is a dumbed-down child-like comprehension of complex human behavior. If you want to know the main factor for a male&amp;#39;s (or female&amp;#39;s) position in their respective hierarchy, it&amp;#39;s reliabilty. The more people rely on you, the higher you go. And if the people that others rely on, rely on you, then you&amp;#39;re probably at the very top of the pecking order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bit of a tangent, but does anyone else feel like that could be the case for this behavior?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw for the purposes of discussion, here are some examples of what I consider to be well-made &amp;quot;badass&amp;quot; female characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashoka Tano - Star Wars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alita - Battle Angel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scarlet Witch - Marvel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katniss Everdeen - Hunger Games&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only issue is how someone can get an ID, but we should get legislators to build more DMVs and get them to open for longer, and provide free access to an ID for people who have a verified address of residence (homeless shelter should count). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only voter suppression if a country is so poorly run the citizens can&amp;#39;t even verify themselves when they vote. It&amp;#39;s a cheat-able system. There have been times where a few tens of votes made states win. If done on a large enough scale, they can turn ties into wins for a party, which is not exactly fair. Saying because we haven’t seen people cheating we shouldn’t do it is appealing to ignorance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason the country can’t have it is because it uses its tax money so poorly it can’t ensure basic election integrity and uses “trust” as an excuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also believe that everyone is gender non-conforming in their daily lives, therefore everyone is functionally &amp;quot;non-binary.&amp;quot; No one conforms to gender norms 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender identity is based upon cultural concepts of how men and women should behave. How is this not inherently a sexist outlook? When someone says &amp;quot;I just feel like a woman,&amp;quot; it invariably means that they like culturally based (and usually sexist) views of what being a woman means to them. Liking pink or wearing dresses for example has nothing to do with being a woman. I am a woman, I don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; like one, and an itemized list of everything I do that is traditionally feminine also does not make me a woman. And the reverse is true, any masculine thing I do does not make me trans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view is called bigoted, but I think the gender identity believers are the truly bigoted ones. The only thing that matters is biological sex, everything else is culture nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

On Reddit&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;reddiquette&amp;quot; page, it says that &amp;quot;if you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it. &amp;quot;  This makes complete sense to me, and I think this is the way that we should handle ourselves on this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just as a word with an originally intended meaning can come to mean something else over time, the downvote button is not just for when a post doesn&amp;#39;t contribute to a subreddit.  It is specifically for when you dislike or don&amp;#39;t agree with something that someone has posted, despite the original intent of the button.  Here are some thoughts as to why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The upvote button, though originally intended to be for rewarding posts that &amp;quot;contribute to conversation,&amp;quot; is widely accepted as the &amp;quot;I like this&amp;quot; button.  Though it too has deviated from its original purpose, the upvote button&amp;#39;s new purpose is accepted because it&amp;#39;s not problematic.  It&amp;#39;s a reward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The upvote button was intended to be the opposite of the downvote button, and in all ways, it appears to still be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as I can tell, the vast majority of people who use the downvote button at all use it on posts they dislike.  If people use something a certain way, then that is what it is for.  The birth control pill was not originally intended as a contraceptive, but now, it is absolutely a contraceptive.  The company that makes Q-tips specifically doesn&amp;#39;t want you putting them in your ears, but Q-tips are absolutely ear-cleaners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;#39;ll say that I absolutely believe that the downvote button should be used for its originally intended purpose.  It&amp;#39;s important to be exposed to ideas that we&amp;#39;re not comfortable with, and downvoting valid posts hides valid opinions, stopping others from learning from them.  My view here is simply that the downvote button has a very distinct purpose at this time: it is for punishing a post that you dislike or disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;

Grass in general can be very difficult upkeep, on the grass on courses especially so. I imagine more than any other Sport since the quality of the grass really determines the quality of the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average golf course is 150 acres, with roughly 2 million acres. This is all land that is cultivated with the aforementioned watering plus the mowing and fertilizing. All of that land could be used for other resources that are more efficient (yes that can be said about any sport as it’s not technically a necessity, but still that is so much land dedicated to relatively few people). Even if that were turf instead of grass that is still in an enormous area dedicated to the single sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think most sporting events are wasteful as far as their usage of space, so referencing that other sports waste resources too isn’t the point, unless any other sport is more wasteful, especially considering per person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not certain if this view is particularly controversial, or if people does argue against it for the sake of arguing. But I am curious of people genuinely disagree with this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that should be the case in the US (and the world, ideally).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are antivax, I believe that shows an unacceptable level of ignorance, inability to critically think and disregard for the actual science of medical treatment, if you still want to be a physician or nurse (or NP or PA or RT etc.)  (And I believe this also should include mandatory compliance with all vaccines currently recommended by the medical science at the time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just by merit of having a license, you are in the position to be able to influence others, especially young families who are looking for an authority to tell them how to be good parents.  Being antivax is in direct contraction to everything we are taught in school (and practice) about how the human body works.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a new mother I was &amp;quot;vaccine hesitant&amp;quot;.  I was not a nurse or have any medical education at the time, I was a younger mother at 23 with a premature child and not a lot of peers for support.  I was online a lot from when I was on bedrest and I got a lot of support there. And a lot of misinformation. I had a BA, with basic science stuff, but nothing more My children received most vaccines (I didn&amp;#39;t do hep B then I don&amp;#39;t think) but I spread them out over a long period.  I didn&amp;#39;t think vaccines caused autism exactly, but maybe they triggered something, or that the risks were higher for complications and just not sure these were really in his best interest - and I thought &amp;quot;natural immunity&amp;quot; was better.  There were nurses who seemed hesitant too, and Dr. Sears even had an alternate schedule and it seemed like &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; something wasn&amp;#39;t perfect with vaccines then. My doctor just went along with it, probably thinking it was better than me not vaccinating at all and if she pushed, I would go that way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went back to school after I had my second. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I learned more in-depth about how the body and immune system worked, as I got better at critically thinking and learned how to evaluate research papers, I realized just how dumb my views were.  I made sure my kids got caught up with &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; they hadn&amp;#39;t had yet (hep B and chicken pox) Once I understood it well, everything I was reading that made me hesitant now made me realize how flimsy all those justifications were. They are like the dihydrogen monoxide type pages extolling the dangers of water. Or a three year old trying to explain how the body works.  It&amp;#39;s laughable wrong and at some level also hard to know where to start to contradict - there&amp;#39;s just so much that is bad, how far back in disordered thinking do you really need to go? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m all about the vaccinations - with covid, I was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unsure whether they&amp;#39;d be able to make a safe one, but once the research came out, evaluated by other experts, then I&amp;#39;m on board 1000000%.  I got my pfizer three days after it came out in the US.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say all this to demonstrate the potential influence of medical professionals on parents (which is when &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; people become antivax) and they have a professional duty to do no harm, and ignoring science about vaccines does harm.  There are lots of hesitant parents that might be like I was, still reachable in reality, and having medical professionals say any of it gives it a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of weight.  If you don&amp;#39;t want to believe in medicine, that&amp;#39;s fine, you don&amp;#39;t get a license to practice it.  (or associated licenses)  People are not entitled to their professional licenses.  I think it should include quackery too while we&amp;#39;re at it, but antivax is a good place to start.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tldr:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals with licenses should lose them if they openly promote antivax views. It shows either a grotesque lack of critical thinking, lack of understanding of the body, lack of ability to evaluate research, which is not compatible with a license, or they are having mental health issues and have fallen into conspiracy land from there.  Either way, those are not people who should be able to speak to patients from a position of authority.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t find holes in my logic, but I&amp;#39;m biased as a licensed professional, so I open it to reddit to find the flaws I couldn&amp;#39;t  :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the name doesn&amp;#39;t even specify a particular day. Every June day from the thirteenth to nineteenth would form the same portmanteau (June + *teenth). If the name only specified the month (e.g. June Day, similar to May Day) it wouldn&amp;#39;t be as bad, but as it stands there is a certain kind of fake precision implied.&lt;/p&gt;

There are however two sides to this coin, the guys on the other end don&amp;#39;t seem to understand this issue and often seem like assholes about it and lack communication from what I&amp;#39;ve read.  For example, the gf would ask the bf to unfollow seomgirls because it made them feel uncomfortable, but the guy will make countless excuses about the issue like how the girl is being insecure and invaildate the girls feelings.  This is not okay and not my point, my point is to recognize the underlying issue, which I haven&amp;#39;t heard talked about at all and try to fix it.  This issue of insecurity and jealousy and how it arises is another topic of discussion.  Can someone explain to me why I&amp;#39;m wrong or provide another perspective.  As a guy myself, I dont really feel this insecurity and jealousy and this post isn&amp;#39;t suppose to be a generalization of all women, but I&amp;#39;ve primarily just seen women bring up this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

He has already gone to prison three times since then and escaped every time. Recently he killed a whole family in Brasília, and the police is still looking for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no death penalty in Brazil and I’m very convinced that this “extreme” measure would end with all the panic it’s been going on in the last weeks here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably some would argue that “everyone deserves a second chance”, or (that’s very popular actually) “he is a society’s victim” or “let’s rehabilitate instead of punishing”; but, seriously, the authorities even lost the count of the amount of crimes this guy has made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lázaro should’ve already been killed before and should EVEN MORE be killed now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just an example to illustrate my point of what the lack of this penalty can cause. Brazilian goverment yet hasn’t applied the penalty and that’s very upsetting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to convince me that death penalty is not necessary or justified. CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Sorry for not specifying earlier. Given the situation, I’m specifically talking about the penalty in Brazil, so please have in mind the country’s situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direct military action against the PRC is suicidal because they have nuclear weapons. Even if they didn&amp;#39;t, who would be willing to sacrifice millions (if not tens of millions) of their countrymen to liberate the Uyghurs? Also, in the last 20 years, military actions by Western nations have resulted in horrific failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who say &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;we need to set an example that genocide isn&amp;#39;t OK&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, the PRC constantly brings up Western nations&amp;#39; atrocities to claim that we have no right to criticize them, and imply that genocides are OK because we did genocides too. This not only makes the PRC look heroic to its populace, it also makes Westerners question if we do have any right to criticize the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCP has a strong grip on power. Many of its citizens remember poverty within their own lifetimes, and are grateful to the CCP for uplifting them out of poverty (regardless of whether or not the CCP deserves such credit). Plus, as mentioned in point #2, they take advantage of endless opportunities to deflect blame. If it didn&amp;#39;t have a strong grip on power, then it&amp;#39;s not long before another Chinese Civil War begins, which would not necessarily be good for Uyghurs, and would cause suffering all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racism and apathy against minorities exists everywhere, including in liberal democracies. There is no reason to believe that these problems don&amp;#39;t exist in the PRC too. What hope is there in fixing a racism problem if there is no will to fix it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My country, Australia, has a severe economic dependence on exporting to the PRC. Most other countries have the PRC among their top 3 trading partners. We have reached a point where it is economic suicide to boycott or sanction the PRC. And before you tell me &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;why not boycott or sanction the USA for its atrocities&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, the same deal applies there (and that&amp;#39;s not even getting into Australia&amp;#39;s own shameful history). The most powerful countries can get away with almost everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PRC has managed economic growth despite the ongoing pandemic. Aside from Australia and New Zealand, most Western countries have been hit very hard by the pandemic, both in terms of GDP decline and deaths. Even if the PRC is covering up the truth about its pandemic deaths, the pandemic has accelerated the decline of Western nations in terms of economic, cultural, diplomatic and military power. Even if the PRC were lying about its economic growth, it doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that all other nations have been weakened by the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this very sub, we get a lot of people claiming &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;the PRC will hit a brick wall because of a housing bubble / middle income trap / aging population / corruption&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. Yet this crash never comes. It makes me believe that the CCP has found a way to somehow dodge the consequences of these problems, a way that none of us westerners have figured out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a member of &lt;a href=&quot;/r/EnoughCommieSpam&quot;&gt;r/EnoughCommieSpam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/r/EnoughWumaoSpam&quot;&gt;r/EnoughWumaoSpam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/r/Shitwehraboossay&quot;&gt;r/Shitwehraboossay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/r/Shitracistssay&quot;&gt;r/Shitracistssay&lt;/a&gt; because I oppose totalitarianism, racism and genocide. I would love to have hope, but deep down, I know that there is no hope, so I try to pretend there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: In case someone tells me &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;concern about the Uyghurs is virtue signalling&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;people only care about the Uyghurs because it&amp;#39;s trendy to do so&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s irrelevant. Whether or not these accusations are true doesn&amp;#39;t affect my opinion that there is no hope about the situation of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand that in the U.S. the servers are paid $2 an hour and they need to make up their pay in tips but let’s talk about where tipping culture has taken us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you get coffee or a cookie from a bakery, the credit card machine asks for a tip. The cashier stares at you, and you have to manually click “other” and select 0. The pressure and looks you receive, simply because you don’t want to pay someone for DOING THEIR JOB. I should not feel pressured to pay extra so the cashier can grab a pre-made cookie and put it in a bag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen the argument “you are paying for a service”, does that mean we should tip the person helping us find a pair of pants in the store? Should we tip the customer service workers in grocery stores for bagging our milk? Should anyone other than an employer be paying the worker? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked in fast food and clothing retail and never once expected to get paid by the customer FOR DOING MY JOB THAT I CHOSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back to the low pay, in Canada they used to pay servers $2 less than minimum wage, now they are paying them the same as minimum wage, yet tipping is still expected. There is no reason for tipping culture here since servers are being paid enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. I have seen people say that your employer will make up what you don’t get in tips. So that means everyone is still getting paid a fair wage right? So what’s the point? Why is tipping now becoming mandatory for other services as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a tendency to speak my mind on social media and I engage into discussions with people on both sides.  I have come to the conclusion that while the left has its issues, every person that I speak to that is right wing in my personal opinion seems to be misled.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point 1:
     It recently popped into my head that there is no reputable news source that posts conservative content, I listen to NPR, BBC, Al Jazeera and I watch David Pakman and Secular talk on youtube.  There is no mainstream conservative outlet aside from fox, which is just not factual content, it is only fear mongering and propaganda.  I have watched the daily wire and louder with crowder and while they are well spoken and not necessarily propaganda, it seems to me that they only seek to disprove liberals and that is their only agenda.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point 2:
     My closing statement in the last point brings me to this thought, when Trump was president what legislation were they pushing forward, i guess that you could say things like tax cuts and deregulation are a part of the conservative agenda, but i don’t see conservatives advocating for anything or making calls to action.  To put simply, there is no platform for conservatism and they have no goals aside from opposing liberals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point 3:
     My conclusion is that those that are republican legislators truly only have the interest of generating wealth inequality and those that support them only do because they either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;do not actually get informed, they only use social media platforms and segments or their family members/community to form their opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;they watch fox news, which is truly only propaganda and a tool for persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Like the practice of tipping, guys paying for the girl isn’t inherently required but there are currently strong social norms pressuring for it. Up until now I’ve been footing the bill on the first date, but I’m recently becoming of the opinion that first dates should always be split. Here are my reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) In this time and age, men and women are equal and so it’s only fair that both are contributing to the dating experience, including the financial cost of it. Any argument for why the guy should pay for the first date, why can it not equally apply to women?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) If I, as a guy, pay for first dates, that’s essentially indirect prostitution. I may not be buying sex outright and no one is entitled to sex just because they paid for the other person, but sex is something many guys have in the back of the minds when offering to pay. Otherwise why pay for the first date because after all no one consistent foots the entire bill when they hang out with another friend for the first time? The closest analogy I have to this point is buying escorts. Although escorting is illegal and is legally considered prostitution, you’re technically not buying sex directly even though the intent is there. “Technically” you’re just buying the girl’s time and if sex happens then it happens but an escort doesn’t inherently owe you sex because you paid only for her time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Most dates, in my experience, don’t progress past the first date even if I think the first date went great from my perspective. For a random first date, if I pay for that date I have a decent likelihood of not getting a return on that investment. I’m not referring to sex here, but rather a second date&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Not paying on the first date helps weed out gold diggers so I’m not wasting time/money on several dates before realizing the girl is a gold digger&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only instances a guy should pay for the girl on the first date are if 1) he suggests an upscale or otherwise expensive date or 2) the guy genuinely wants to treat the girl (for ex, maybe if they were friends before)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common argument I’m expecting to hear is that whoever asks the other person out should pay for the date. I strongly disagree with this for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The vast majority of women do not ask men out for a first date. Yes, some women do but most of them will not. Even if the woman wants a date, the typical women will likely just wait for the man to make the first move in asking her out rather than directly asking the man out herself. So I’m practice this argument essentially automatically becomes the guy almost always paying for the first date&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) When you invite another friend to hang out with you, it’s typically expected that each person will pay for themselves. Why is it any different for dating regardless of who asks out who as long as the date is not overly expensive? If the guy suggests a date that the girl cannot afford, the girl should either directly state that it’s out of her budget, offer an alternative suggestion that is within budget, or decline the date altogether. The girl should not automatically assume the date will be paid for by the guy.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve worked in the restaurant industry and make sure to always tip well. However, I don&amp;#39;t like the common idea of tipping 15-20%  of your bill. For instance, one would tip their waiter $10 if they get a  $50 plate (going with 20% tip here). But tip the same waiter, in the same restaurant,  $4 if they ordered a $20 plate instead . In both instances, you are getting the same quality of food, same service, and the waiter is doing the same amount of work. It doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me to have to give such a larger tip for the same amount of work only because I decided to get a more expensive dish/drink.&lt;/p&gt;

They’re people who slipped through the net. Dropped out of school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nah I don’t buy it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In developed countries, everyone gets access to an education. The people coming out of the woodwork as anti-vaxxers aren’t those from working class families. Those with working class upbringings are far too busy making a living and enjoying their lives than to find time peddling conspiracies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly antivaxxers are from middle class white upbringings. They had simple upbringings and limited life experiences. With everything handed to them on a plate, they never struggled for anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardship for them growing up was having their Nintendo taken away from them, or having no pocket money for a week because they didn’t go to church. The same kids who later on spent too much of their student loan on crack and had to ring home to mummy and daddy so they had enough money for an Uber home from the club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this endless life of nothing, of mediocrity, of underachieving because you had no reason to strive for better ultimately leads to very unhappy people. No meaning to life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pandemic gave these privileged losers the illusion of hardship, of oppression. Who else would see a mask as oppressive? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not the Holocaust survivor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not the domestic abuse survivor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not the refuge, homeless and stateless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This illusion of hardship has done something very strange to their brains. It’s given their life meaning. Not in the same way most people perceive “meaning” but a purpose of a sort still. When people feel oppressed they find ways of resisting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly they feel unique and special as they find other people online who feel the same. They can send each other their “research” - various opinion pieces disguised as peer reviewed research or even referencing real research taken out of context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep down many of them know they’re living a fantasy, but they don’t care because they’re part of a unique underground resistance. They’re not mediocre like their parents - they’re doing something really special with their lives. They never believed in something bigger than themselves before which is the reason why they’re so difficult to reason with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The solution?&lt;/strong&gt; isn’t better education. We all have access to education it just depends whether you choose to ignore what you learnt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never give your kids a ride, an easy life: A passionless existence. Because they will find something truly fucked up to fill that void. Drug addiction, alcoholism or the absolute worst: A passion for Anti-Vax or other truth denialism.&lt;/p&gt;

From my knowledge, most government initiatives for reducing obesity and improving nutrition/exercise knowledge have focused on children in schools. I definitely believe that health/nutrition is important and should be taught in schools as well, but I think that workplace interventions would be more effective for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children are not responsible for dietary decisions. Even if they share what they learn about healthy eating with their parents, it does not mean that they will buy or cook healthier food. By the time the children become adults, they will have likely forgotten a lot of what they have learned and will need to brush up on health information anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children have less executive functioning ability and are more likely to give in to immediate gratification than adults. Of course children are capable of making healthy decisions, but to be realistic, most children will eat junk food if it is available to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workplaces are the ideal place to have interventions because most adults in North America work, so they are there anyway. Even if community programs are available, adults need to find the time, transportation, money, etc. to be able to attend. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a built-in social support network because you can attend meetings with your coworkers and engage in workplace events like healthy potlucks or group exercises. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I support grants to restaurants that serve healthy food etc., but nutrition education is important to help people make decisions about what/where to eat in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of nutrition misinformation among adults. Fad diets and unsustainable weight loss plans are common. A lot of nutrition research is behind paywalls or written in a way that is difficult for people that aren&amp;#39;t experts to understand, and evidence about best practices has changed over time as research methods have improved. Therefore, I believe it is important to have professionals &amp;quot;translate&amp;quot; nutrition/exercise information into resources that are easily understood by the lay person and provide clear ways to take action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I believe that government resources designated to fight obesity should be largely allocated to offering interventions at workplaces. I believe the hardest part would be getting employers on board. However, for a lot of businesses, a one hour session every week or two is unlikely to have a dramatic effect on output. Even sessions offered immediately after work would be more accessible than community programs. It might help to get employers on board if they take the perspective that improved health in their employers would reduce sick days, money used for benefits, physical injuries, and even improve mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

The action in the film is not just to have mindless action, it serves a purpose based on what the characters are trying to do. It makes sense based on their characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The small and tight cast allows them to each have a significant amount of screen time, and we get a good understanding for who they are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The villain is an unstoppable force with a singular understandable motivation, and while not having an incredible amount of character is still one of the most iconic villains ever created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film balance is practical effects and CGI to quite near perfection. It was done so well that it still holds up to today’s standards. On top of all of this the film is complemented by a great score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may not be controversial enough of an opinion, but I was mainly curious to see what other films people consider to be good contenders. I’m not trying to be too technical people consider this more of a sci-fi thriller or sci-fi action or whatever a sub genre, if we can consider this in a general sense in action film I would say it is one of the greatest&lt;/p&gt;

The reason for this, I understand, is historical. Eye doctors/optometrists aren&amp;#39;t educated at the same facilities as ophthalmologists and the professions were historically considered separate. However, I don&amp;#39;t think it makes sense that traditional health insurance plans in the USA don&amp;#39;t cover vision care. Arguments I have heard for why this makes sense:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people don&amp;#39;t use vision insurance, so adding it in would drive up premiums unnecessarily. I don&amp;#39;t think this makes sense at all. Most people won&amp;#39;t require *most* services that their health insurance plans cover. I have never needed a cardiologist, a radiologist, or a dermatologist, but if I did, my health insurance plan would cover it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vision insurance isn&amp;#39;t medically necessary; you won&amp;#39;t die just because you can&amp;#39;t see well. I think this argument is made primarily by people who don&amp;#39;t have poor vision. I do have poor vision, and my glasses/contact lenses allow me to live a normal life. It&amp;#39;s just as medically necessary for my health and happiness as a hearing aid or prosthetic. I could not function independently without my glasses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vision care is relatively cheap, so most people can afford it on their own, so it isn&amp;#39;t an injustice that it isn&amp;#39;t covered. Perhaps, but it&amp;#39;s still a huge hassle to have to shell out a couple hundred dollars every year for something I need to function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only argument I&amp;#39;ve ever heard that even remotely makes sense to me is that eye care is usually a very predictable, fixed cost every year, so it wouldn&amp;#39;t make economic sense to cover it. For example, insurance companies know that it will cost them about $100 per person with vision deficiencies per year, so they will try to get each of those people to pay in about $100 each for the benefits, which then defeats the purpose of the insurance policy for the customer, as they will be just as well off paying for the services directly themselves. The thing I don&amp;#39;t understand is why this argument is applied to vision insurance and nothing else. For example, I could see it being quite predictable that women of child-bearing age will each cost an insurance company $500 every three years for pap smears--thus insurance companies would try to raise prices to recoup those costs--and then the insurance plan would no longer really be a viable option for the customer. But it only seems to happen for optometry and other services considered medically unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually am generally extremely pleased with my health insurance, but this one baffles me. Other than for historical reasons, why can&amp;#39;t I get vision care through my insurance? Why can I get so many services for free but when I need glasses, I&amp;#39;m left scouring weird websites hunting for deals? Why does this system make sense at all? Someone please CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

The article might say something like &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; posted several tweets from 2012-14&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; has apologised for their comments&amp;#39;, and may include comments from other people in response to the original offending posts, but the posts themselves are typically not included. In my opinion, this is extremely unhelpful and failing to fulfil a pretty basic requirement of being a news outlet. If the focus of the article is what the person has said, then surely including what they actually said is pretty essential. And how are readers supposed to know how to feel about the comments or the commenter if they don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;ve actually said?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be an argument in favour of omitting the comments on the grounds that the media outlets do not want to provide a &amp;#39;platform&amp;#39; or be otherwise associated with crude or offensive language. But this standard only seems to really apply to archaic social media posts. If, for example, a famous person made crude/offensive comments today in an interview or press conference, most media outlets would report what they said verbatim. Indeed, even &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; social media posts by famous people don&amp;#39;t get this treatment. For example, here&amp;#39;s a BBC article from 2019 about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/48306223&quot;&gt;the rugby player Israel Folau&amp;#39;s homophobic post on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. The article quotes the post verbatim. Meanwhile, here is a recent article from the BBC about cricketer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/57379184&quot;&gt;Ollie Robinson being suspended for historical racist and sexist tweets&lt;/a&gt;. This article does not make any mention of the exact content of Robinson&amp;#39;s tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing IMO would be for the media to include the original posts in their reports. If necessary, they can add some kind of warning that the content may be upsetting, or a disclaimer that these views do not represent the views of the outlet in question (although I sort of assumed all quotes in news reports came with that implication anyway), but reporting in as much detail and with as much accuracy as possible seems like a pretty basic part of publishing any form of news.&lt;/p&gt;

My fingers have been married to a keyboard since my early teens, and as I make the climb through my late 20s, I am starting to feel the effects of constantly sitting down. Earlier this week, I came to the decision that I needed to make some changes for the sake of my health, and I started researching to find the best standing desk options. I parsed through dozens of written reviews and a equal measure of video reviews on sites like YouTube and I found one common thread among many of them. The person or persons reviewing the product did not actually purchase it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They either had it sent after they requested a &lt;em&gt;review copy&lt;/em&gt; (which is a whole other conversation), and were propositioned by the company to review their product in exchange for a free model. Some of the sites that featured these sponsored reviews were fairly popular, as were the videos, so it was obvious these so called opinion pieces were getting plenty of attention. But how genuine can an opinion on a product be, when you got the product for free? Under no circumstance should anyone be allowed to post reviews of free products, and especially when they don&amp;#39;t even disclose the product was free outright. During my foray into the office supply side of YouTube I encountered many reviewers using semantic sleight of hand to get around just saying they &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;did not purchase the item&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;[Company] reached out to me&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I collaborated with [company] to&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks to [Company] for being a part of this video&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course all is revealed in the description of the video where they, likely due to fear of legal or platform trouble, place a disclaimer stating they did not purchase the product. If they were honest they would start of the video by stating clearly, &amp;quot;This item was sent to me for free by [company]&amp;quot;, but they know this would degrade the usefulness of their review, and for good reason. The main thing that brought me to my current conclusion is how these sponsored reviews poison the well of information a consumer has to shift through in order to make an informed choice. You might say: &amp;quot;Just ignore them&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Take it with a grain of salt&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t think that is enough. There is a real harm that comes from having so many reviews on sites like YouTube with millions of hits that are essentially paid testimonials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me provide a scenario.: I am a YouTuber with a growing channel centered around tech reviews, news, gaming, etc. I decide I want to upgrade my setup and get more desk space, so I research around and decide to by a standing desk. It cost around $500 and 30 minutes of my time in assembly. When I decide to review this desk, I will have in my mind the amount I spent, and will be making near constant comparisons between it and the value it does or does not provide. &amp;quot;For $500, I really expected better stability&amp;quot;, or similar statements. I am not just reviewing a product. I am in real time justifying or lamenting over my purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for completion, let&amp;#39;s imagine what the other side my might look like: I am a popular YouTuber with hundreds of thousands of subscribers. I am routinely asked by major and minor companies to review their products in my videos, often at no cost to me. I receive &lt;em&gt;review copies&lt;/em&gt; which unbeknownst to me, may be quality controlled especially carefully and maybe even tweaked to an extent that they do not represent the product a regular consumer will receive. Sometimes I am the one doing the requesting, but in either case, I pay nothing. When I review a desk, there is no careful consideration regarding whether the money I spent was worth it, because I didn&amp;#39;t spend any. My comparisons are cold and unfeeling because the entire thing was one big transaction, and my review is being compensated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not get honesty from the latter scenario. There may be some paid reviewers who try to be truthful in there reviews but the conflict of interest is far too great to ignore, and if you ask me, is criminal in a lot of ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, while it was the standing desk research that brought this issue to the forefront of my mind, most of what I discussed in this post is directly, if not perfectly applicable to other consumer products. Tech, clothing, art supplies, shoelaces, the little plastic tips you put on shoelaces, shoes, lace, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;

You can&amp;#39;t simultaneously teach the most extreme forms of trans acceptance and that gender roles are harmful social constructs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically, we&amp;#39;re trying to open up our society to all of these different ways that people can and do identify. That is a good thing. I&amp;#39;m down for radical tolerance. However, we&amp;#39;re also trying to instill the fact that gender expression is a societal phenomena, which can be restrictive and harmful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this creates a paradox. It&amp;#39;s like this &amp;quot;gender roles are a social construct, you don&amp;#39;t have to base your behavior or identity on them. But, if you don&amp;#39;t identify with society&amp;#39;s portrayal of this gender, you&amp;#39;re probably some other gender.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this presents a huge problem. Are we attempting so hard to be accepting to non-traditional genders, that we&amp;#39;re failing at destroying gender roles? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I care because my daughter might come to me some day, questioning her assigned gender. Do I tell her that identifying with &amp;quot;boy&amp;quot; things doesn&amp;#39;t make her a boy, or do I tell her it&amp;#39;s okay if she feels more like a boy than a girl?? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind could be changed if someone presented me with a fairly concrete definition, which explains the differences between these things. Thanks for your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: thank you, everyone, for the civility and understanding. I was really worried I might come off as transphobic, and y&amp;#39;all have showed me a lot of patience. I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I am lazy and lack confidence. If I was being myself, I would avoid social situations altogether. If I can&amp;#39;t avoid them, I would either not say a word, or I would talk about nerdy (i.e. video games) or controversial (i.e. economics or politics) topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This advice is too vague and general, and it accomplishes nothing. If someone is struggling with a math problem, you wouldn&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;just apply the math you learned in class&amp;quot;. You would understand what specific shortcoming is causing them to have issues solving the problem, and target that shortcoming with your advice. So better advice would be structured like &amp;quot;I think you should brush up on U-substitution. That should help you with these types of integration problems.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

So, please forgive me if this does not make much sense and please know that I&amp;#39;m more than ready to change my view, or at least have it adjusted.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it seems to me that a lot of American media has no idea what &amp;quot;far-left&amp;quot; means.  Here&amp;#39;s an article from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/real-radicals-arent-washington-opinion-1591769&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (since when is &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; like &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;, by the way?) talking about &amp;quot;far-left&amp;quot; billionaire George Soros.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far-left billionaire?  That&amp;#39;s like having a Nazi rabbi.  You can&amp;#39;t be far-left and a billionaire.  If you are truly &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt;-left, then you oppose private property and seek the overthrow of existing systems of power.  There cannot be a &amp;quot;far-left&amp;quot; billionaire.  Billionaires are by definition members of the exploiting class.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there cannot be a &amp;quot;far-left&amp;quot; Hollywood or Silicon Valley agenda.  Hollywood and Silicon Valley exist to cash-in on on vanity and narcissism.  They are the antithesis of far-leftism.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would admit that Hollywood writers, Silicon Valley moguls and certain billionaire financiers are &lt;em&gt;liberals,&lt;/em&gt; and that they use their considerable power and influence to oppose traditional interpretations of sexuality, gender and race.  I would also concede that this probably infuriates a lot of religious and nationalist conservatives but this does not make them &amp;quot;far-left&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, true &amp;quot;radical leftists&amp;quot; would oppose identity politics outright and would see it as something conjured up by elites to distract the working classes from their blatant exploitation by profit-driven capitalists.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I have this right.  I&amp;#39;m not saying where I stand on any of these issues but can anyone honestly say that a true &amp;quot;far-leftist&amp;quot; would support anything produced by media conglomerates, tech magnates and billionaire financiers?  Am I missing something?&lt;/p&gt;

Nevertheless my curiosity has overtaken my fear, which is why I&amp;#39;m here. I don&amp;#39;t mean to be disrespectful in any way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is relevant to my stance in any way, I belong to a minority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone asks that people support a business, simply because that business is owned by someone of a certain race, they&amp;#39;re doing a number of things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active acknowledgment that the owner belongs to a certain race. This within itself is not necessarily racist (depending on how narrow the definition of &amp;quot;racism&amp;quot; is), but the distinction has been made. They are singling out certain businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a suggestion being made that these businesses aren&amp;#39;t doing as well because they are owned by people of a certain race. Am I wrong if I think this suggestion within itself is a form of racist stereotyping, unless it&amp;#39;s coupled with cited evidence of some form of economical analysis/statistical measure? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preference to support certain businesses over other businesses simply because of the owner&amp;#39;s race is inherently a choice made based on race, and is therefore racist. (For instance, if you choose to support a minority business instead of a white-owned business because of the minority factor, that can be construed as racist. And vice versa would be true as well.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always thought of racism as special treatment or consideration (either positive or negative) of one particular race over another. Is there a definition that fits better which would explain the thinking behind supporting businesses because they are owned by a specific race as a move away from racism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:
The majority of responses I have received touch upon 3 main points. I will generally respond to them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Being colourblind is not the answer to racism&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a generous amount of research which suggests that it is literally impossible to escape implicit racial bias. Psychologically speaking the human brain subconsciously registers differences. For those of you speaking about the importance of diversity, I don&amp;#39;t disagree, but I will remind everyone that I am cautious to make this the centre of our discussion because I do not feel that race and culture are not the same thing, although they may be related and/or synonymous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a form of counterbalancing which we accept as a desirable and effective measure against racism&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m reluctant to give in to this argument because I think it&amp;#39;s sticky. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s obviously not the exact same thing, but it&amp;#39;s remniscient of the discussions we have had in the past about the appropriateness of paying reparations to African Americans on the basis of the fact that some of their ancestors being slaves in the past may have set them back generationally in terms of success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I don&amp;#39;t deny that the cycle of poverty is real, it seems racially (or generally, idk) insensitive to say we can balance stuff out simply by doing x.  Such behaviour comes with good intentions but it attempts to quantify the magnitude of other people&amp;#39;s suffering, which is problematic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begets two further questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly: is it not racist to continually single the descendants of certain races out, and tell them that they aren&amp;#39;t doing as well because of their ancestors&amp;#39; past? Even if statistically this is true for a significant proportion of that population, applying the statement as a universal truth to all minority businesses seems like racial stereotyping to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second: when, if ever, can we say we&amp;#39;ve done enough to right the wrong? Who are we to decide? Is it racist to think we can? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is related to the support small/local businesses movement&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A follow-up question: Okay, why don&amp;#39;t we just say that? Why do we have to explicitly mention race?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also: does that mean the statement &amp;quot;support minority businesses&amp;quot; is really only about small/local minority-owned businesses? If a minority-owned business isn&amp;#39;t small or local then are they not topical?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being on reddit - a rather leftist space - I have noticed a lot of people decrying any policy that is right of centre as fascist. I also particularly notice this on things like supporting Trump - trump supporters are automatically labelled racist extremists and fascists when in reality most are just regular folk (though I must admit that I have only met a very small number of pro-trump people, as I am not American and in my country we generally disliked trump well before he came to political prominence - I am just skeptical to think that about half of the USA are actually the way they are portrayed on reddit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you have to be aware of, especially in the current political climate and if your views are fairly far from centre, is that assumptions, reasoning, and logical steps that you will take for granted just dont apply to a lot of other people. I know and have befriended lots of people who diametrically oppose my politics and there are a few I can have really interesting discussions with, and whilst I often very severely disagree with them, I can see how their particular situation brought them to their conclusions. And so the best thing you can do to actually have a constructive conversation about this is to empathise and appeal to that line of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What not to do is to just see that they have come to a conclusion that you don&amp;#39;t like and just assume that they are the worst version that they can possibly be. Sure, overt xenophobia is a lost cause and folks who practice that should be condemned because they aren&amp;#39;t reasonable. But to go back to the example of trump supporters, seeing only the crazies that invade the capitol building and tarring them all with the same brush is absolute nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me it is exactly the same as people on the right claiming that e.g. universal healthcare is communism, or that people who want better wealth equity or racial justice as communists. They&amp;#39;re not. Sure, there are some tankies in there, and from my point of view they should be ignored and condemned too, but when I see the entire left being tarred with that brush I just think it&amp;#39;s an absolutely nonsensical and bad faith put down to try to avoid any actual discourse and instead just try to say &amp;quot;other side bad&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember - the folks who say that are also getting algorithmically fed only the examples of the very worst of the left such as destruction left by BLM protests and the least intelligent amongst the community. That&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re fed of the left, and we know that we&amp;#39;re not actually like that. So don&amp;#39;t ignore that self-awareness and extend it to the folks on the right too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I realise that I am speaking to a primarily American crowd, but I used trump as a contemporary example and this point is not explicitly about him. Trump himself could ostensibly be labelled as fascist, but the point I am making is that being very slightly right of centre and voting a certain way because it&amp;#39;s your party and it aligns with your tax policy is not the same as being far right and voting trump because you hate black people and he will stop immigration. I know that the US electoral system bunches these people together, but that does not mean they&amp;#39;re all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
