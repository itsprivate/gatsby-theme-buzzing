Currently have been looking at stocks that I feel are currently undervalued that have great products/services that I am a fan of. Costco fits this description as I shop their frequently, love their free food samples, love that they pay their employees very well, love the membership money format Costco has set up, love the cheap hot dogs and $5 chickens you can buy. I haven’t seen anything scandalous like sexual assault allegations on the CEO or full closures of every location like other business due to the pandemic, yet their stock since around December of 2020 has been falling closer and closer to their March 2020 pandemic low. (I’ve been using the pandemic low number of each stock I evaluate as their true value indicator) Was curious with the stock being 52 week low of around $280 and 52 week high of $380 if $COST currently sits near $330 is this the time to jump in? Is there some metric or type of graph analysis that I can use to try and more accurately predict the “bottom value” before their stock begins climbing again?&lt;/p&gt;

I have most of money sitting in blue chip stocks like DIS &amp;amp; HSBC amongst many others with a small amount for playing, doing my own DD on and hoping for a 3x but settling for a small profit or loss in most cases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love reading other people’s DD, always have, and it’s great to have a community that helps you cut down a bit of the work (even though you must follow up with your own reading) in potentially spotting something that could be big. However, there has been a massive spike recently of people that finish they DD with ‘this could be the next GME’ or something similar and as soon as I read that, I am instantly out off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything they have said up to that point gets a little tainted for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is completely irrational and actually a bit stupid on my part but I equate it to a restaurant that has ‘The Best (insert food item)‘ or ‘World Famous blah blah’ on their menu. It puts me off instantly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone else feel like this? Or am I just being an snooty?&lt;/p&gt;

Please, be kind. I tried to summarise the feelings of users in this post, so we don&amp;#39;t need to continue griefing the mod team... You could say... I LIKE the mod team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did we not get transparency about how gæmstonk megathreads were going to be handled, ahead of time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the thread wasn&amp;#39;t made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the threads made by users were being manually deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we got a comment stickied to the top of the daily thread saying words to the effect of &amp;quot;no more gæmstonk daily threads, more news later.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That comment got deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we&amp;#39;re told &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s because interest in gæmstonk has died down&amp;quot; (???????? Do you people LOOK at your own subreddit?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then RKT gets a sticky. It gets MASS brigaded by the rightly fucked off gæmstonk pushers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we get told that the mods simply &amp;quot;forgot&amp;quot; to make the gæmstonk thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then finally, it was because Opinion forgot to set an alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What. The. Fuck. Is. Going. On?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t want people to believe in conspiracies? Act homogeneously and transparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t seen ANY good DD on gæmstonk for DAYS even though there is TONS of important movement going on with it. Somehow RKT is the ONLY majorly mentioned DD ticker on Monday? Somehow &lt;em&gt;that alone justifies a sticky?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That precedent is extremely dangerous. I hope you have highly competent tools that protect against vote manipulation and spam... because if all it takes is a single highly rated post and ticker the day before to earn a sticky the following day... you leave the entire subreddit vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note... Everyone believes 3/19 is the MOASS date... BUT OPEN INTEREST IN gæmstonk IS HIGHER THIS FRIDAY. THIS. FRIDAY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am extremely bullish on GME and in my opinion this is the second best time to buy. It can&amp;#39;t only go up. But if momentum is there... it can. I doubt MM&amp;#39;s have delta&amp;#39;d for 200. 250. 300. 350... for this Friday, because right now it&amp;#39;s limping at 115. And there are 24,000 calls at 800 for Friday. That is just ASTRONOMICAL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movement is best THIS WEEK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows it... because all the front page gæmstonk text posts are just straight dumpster garbage. Zero information. All fluff. And people wonder why they think it&amp;#39;s a dead play, a dumb play. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to believe asinine theories like top-down manipulation. So some clarity on this is going to deeply alleviate that poisonous sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: there is a mod reply, please don&amp;#39;t downvote it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: this is a really good time to remind retail that... we are a significant force. Decoherent, stupid, self destructive... but sometimes even a room full of monkeys all throw their shit in the same direction. So just be more conscious of what that direction is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 4: I censored the ticker to avoid spam from bots. Guess it worked. Had hardly any (like one?) Emoji/stupid comment.&lt;/p&gt;

5 THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE THE STOCK MARKET…]]></description><link>https://reddit.buzzing.cc/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lwu16p/33_wednesdays_premarket_stock_movers_news/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://reddit.buzzing.cc/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lwu16p/33_wednesdays_premarket_stock_movers_news/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 15:32:54 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=&quot;/r/stocks&quot;&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Wednesday, March 3rd, 2021-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-3-2021.html&quot;&gt;5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;1. Dow futures jump after Tuesday’s early gain fizzles and reverses&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday’s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street’s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government’s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for ‘every adult’ by end of May&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate “every adult in America” by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they’re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;4. America’s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for ‘Dreamers’&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;America’s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations — including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber — asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;5. Stocks to watch: Rocket Companies, Las Vegas Sands, Oscar Health&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rocket Companies fell 6% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after more than doubling over the past three sessions. On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket. Apollo fell nearly 1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oscar Health is set to debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The health insurance startup backed by Google-parent Alphabet priced its initial public offering Tuesday evening at $39 per share, above the already-raised expected range of $36 to $38. The IPO gives Oscar Health a market value of $7.7 billion ahead of trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyft (LYFT)&lt;/strong&gt; – The ride-hailing company said that last week saw the highest level of ride volume since the pandemic took hold last March. As a result, Lyft expects to report a smaller quarterly loss than it had previously projected. Lyft shares jumped 5.6% in premarket trading.&lt;/p&gt;

The sale includes The Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Apollo Global shares gained 2.1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wendy’s (WEN)&lt;/strong&gt; – The restaurant chain missed estimates by a penny a share, with quarterly earnings of 17 cents per share. Revenue came in short of forecasts as well. Global comparable sales rose 4.7%, shy of the FactSet consensus estimate of 5.7% due primarily to international weakness. Its shares fell 3.3% in the premarket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key detail that every new trader seems to miss is that volume ultimately controls price movements because the presence of adequate volume validates the price movement. If a price movement fails to be validated by adequate volume , then there is going to be an equal an opposite reaction. There exists a variable that satisfies both quantitative and fundamental analysts. That is the Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) and it is complemented by the Volume Weighted Moving Average ( VWMA ). When you do not consider the weight of volume in price movements, you are at the mercy of manipulative, high volume whales that seek to sink Simple Moving Averages ( SMAs ) during times of low volume in the interest of accumulation of the asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VWAPs can be treated as the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; price of an asset on any given resolution, but become less sensitive to change as you zoom out. These ever-shifting values can be treated as floors, in bullish times, and ceilings, during a bear market. You can always expect a &amp;quot;bounce&amp;quot; off of the VWAP in the opposite direction at least once as price attempts to cross over it. These resistance lines are useful to every audience, the soon-to-be long holders who would like to plan a decent entry, the short sellers trying to make a quick buck, and the swing traders who like to make money regardless of who controls the market. One should always keep in mind that price never strays too far from the VWAP before attempting to violently correct itself in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a measure of movement around the VWAP , which we&amp;#39;ll call volatility , and it masks the true price of the asset and its direction. By following the VWAP , you can see accurately whether the asset is going high or low. I&amp;#39;m using these customized bands to look for long entries (in the green or below) and short entries (in the red or above) to make short term profits to be accumulated in my spot balances. Ultimately, by building your position you can ensure a long-term profit but it doesn&amp;#39;t mean too much if one simply never takes profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longs can be slept on. Shorts must be monitored. Set a budget, craft a plan, and stick to it. Remember to remove your principal investment at some point to reduce your risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bull market, buy at the monthly VWAP (Purple Line) and in a bear market, sell there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of China&amp;#39;s most powerful financial officials is sounding the alarm over a bubble in global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guo Shuqing, the Communist Party boss at the People&amp;#39;s Bank of China, told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that confidence in Chinese markets could be hit by volatility around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are really afraid the bubble for foreign financial assets will burst someday,&amp;quot; said Guo, who is also chairman of China&amp;#39;s Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was inspired by the choppy market action to do a write up on losing control when you trade. It&amp;#39;s extracted from my blog (no self promote, no links or sneaky sheet), maybe it resonates with you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s about losing and regaining control on the holy grail of trading YOUR trading plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Happens When we Lose Control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted this in Daytrading but the exact same applies for investors or long term traders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many destructive emotions or situations stir up feelings associated with loss of control. &lt;strong&gt;Some examples of what&amp;#39;s happened to me in the past:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You buy a stock, it goes down, you sell it to avoid losing money and it literally goes back up the next second, so you jump back in and it goes down again!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, you are trying to control whether or not you make money. The obvious problem here - &lt;strong&gt;you don&amp;#39;t control price.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the most common root causes of over-trading. And comes down to a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not have a trading plan that you understand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotions are acted on instantly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear is in the passenger seat and you are trying to gain control of your emotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your current system doesn&amp;#39;t suit your personality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading is so full of paradoxes it would make you sick to your stomach, in fact, it does make some people literally sick to their stomach. The very need for control and our primitive brain  is basically wired to stop us from making money. Admitting we don&amp;#39;t know where a stock will go is the first step to recovery, and a long road it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2 (Based on the above):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holding onto losses in order to avoid the pain of &amp;quot;loss&amp;quot;. There are many terms for this, for more info you can look into the disposition effect. Here we have the metamorphosis of a &amp;quot;trader&amp;quot;, someone who always tells you when they are winning to an &amp;quot;investor&amp;quot;, someone who holds shit stocks while they tank.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this ties into control (and ego) which quite frankly are like peas in a pod and feed from one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By trying to control the outcome of a trade, we find all sorts of ways to really fuck up our trading strategy in all sorts of creative ways. The very things we try to avoid, which in &amp;quot;normal life can be easy&amp;quot;, in the stock market, are impossible. If your wife/husband asks you if you look fat, you can tell a white lie. If a stock goes down and you own it, no lie will bail you out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stock market doesn&amp;#39;t give a shit about how much money we make or lose, it&amp;#39;s totally objective. Therefore, saying it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;rigged&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;manipulated&amp;quot; is totally irrelevant because it is rigged for all of us with few exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we Can&amp;#39;t Control&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality of trading in terms of control is simple. It&amp;#39;s much better to avoid things we can&amp;#39;t control as the energy expended in this way removes focus from what we can control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very easy to say but the long term impact will be successful trading or mediocre trading. As it turns out, we can&amp;#39;t actually control the entire world - who would have thought! Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How much the central bank prints or doesn&amp;#39;t print&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How governments will react to certain situations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything to do with the news&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If country A decides to bomb country B&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People (long term)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the things outside of our control are what freak us out of positions, push us into making rash buying or selling decisions and trigger our fight or flight reactions and derail any half-decent trading plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will openly admit I spend too much time on what I can&amp;#39;t control. When it comes to people, stressful situations and even macro-economics. It is very hard to drown out the inputs from social media, friends, family and others. Even worse still is to avoid holding strong opinions on all of the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So What Can we Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All is not lost though. If we could not control any variables in our stock market endeavors it would be pretty damn pointless to trade. The ingredients for success are truly found in the decisions we make in relation to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we buy a stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we sell a stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What strategy we decide upon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much of whatever we buy or sell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The types of things we decide to watch, listen to and or read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The people we surround ourselves with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The daily habits we create around trading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping a trading journal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significant difference between what we can and can&amp;#39;t control is this little thing called &lt;strong&gt;effort&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes &lt;strong&gt;significant effort&lt;/strong&gt; to find, test, understand and lose money when we start trading, the learning curve really can&amp;#39;t be understated. Even worse, those who do well initially end up getting ruined because the precedent is set that &amp;quot;this is easy&amp;quot;. That lack of experience always catches up, be it in stocks or any other pursuit. This is the Dunning Kruger effect in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having logged my trades for a number of years, many patterns show up and repeat themselves most notably in times of duress. For me personally this included the following  - for which I now am 100% accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying too soon, usually due to FOMO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling too soon, usually due to fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying on tips from Twitter and friends - the worst of the worst, I still fall for this one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not taking trades out of fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few which were underpinned by one major theme: &lt;strong&gt;not following my trading plan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, I still have my days and even months where I have lost control of my process and am tired, sick of everything and slip up. Yes of course, it costs me money every time and if you think I have down days because of it - you are absolutely correct. The real difference now is I know where I am going wrong, that I can improve it and make serious money trading stocks in the long run. &lt;strong&gt;I know what I can and can not control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all starts with having a clear plan, a very understandable unambiguous trading system, tons of real trades and a meticulous journal to keep track of where you are winning and losing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, taking these lessons and reshaping habits, patterns and hang-ups to eventually become consistent and eventually have it down to a performance art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apex of these points is total control over what you do during the trading day, how you can manage your emotion and execute that trading plan. The ability to follow this plan and learn from will either create or destroy potential traders, especially in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very long post, sorry - I hope it helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$APPF - Good support down here but we have a few days to wait it out and watch though. Indicators all super low, and it is looking good but we need to see some type of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$AWR  - Falling due to earnings as well, but we are right near support. Very low risk play here, all indicators are super low, it is looking prime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$COR  - Again, crashing right into support - so let&amp;#39;s wait for some sign of life. Indicators are all low which is also good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$CTSO - Testing the 200EMA at old resistance, which is great. All indicators are all low as well which is good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$ERIE - This channel up is sexual. Earnings seems to have been survived, but 200EMA, support, and trend up here. Indicators all low looking good for a continuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$HRTX - Great value, support, and 200EMA right above it so we should wait. Looking real tasty. Indicators are all low here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$IAA  - Support, trend up, and 200EMA are all right here holding it up. Indicators are low which is good too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$NI   - Great value on this descending triangle but it has fairly low reward, but super low risk. Indicators are low, but RSI is just fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$RNG  - Bouncing off the 200EMA, support, and possible trend up here. Looking real good! Indicators are all low as well!&lt;/p&gt;

Needless to say, much like the rest of you, I have spent hours upon hours looking at the trends, shorts, and data since the day of reckoning last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And with the jump last week there has been a lot of paper hand BS/ Misinformation being spread&lt;/strong&gt; (especially with RKT)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: As someone rightfully pointed to RKT is not bad, just the bots and the public narrative is a bit suspect IMO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To simply put it,&lt;/strong&gt; in my opinion, &lt;strong&gt;we are on the verge of something big&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL:DR at the bottom for the most atuist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is why my fellow tards,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have proven the community strength&lt;/strong&gt;, A LOT I MEAN A LOT of us have held and held until we were finally seeing some &lt;strong&gt;green&lt;/strong&gt; for the first time in weeks. I mean serious green, despite the quote on quote &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Lackluster day&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; we are still up &lt;strong&gt;162.5%&lt;/strong&gt; the past WEEK!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A stock with relatively little discussion on this page (IN COMPARISON TO GME) (RKT) is suddenly piking 50,60,70% increase???&lt;/strong&gt; Not to knock any fellow apes who invested (hopefully we will see a dump in GME soon after) but &lt;strong&gt;it is so suspicious that a large movement into RKT aligns with the GME rise.&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;#39;t take my word on this, but we have seen in the past other &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;GAMMA SQUEEZE&amp;quot; for fill in the blank as soon as GME has spiked, and what happens after? They fall and fall hard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The HF are scared, bad. With news breaking about Melvin and Citadale breaking over the past week, we know &lt;strong&gt;that they have lost billions.&lt;/strong&gt; Not only that , they have continued to short the stock with heavy volume. Now with naked shorting, no one knows what the present of the float is exactly, but the estimate remains high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOURCE: Wall Street Journal, 5 days ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/v59kaj2xapk61.png?width=914&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2530b261ce274a75e989677eb7eb32a7e5fad028&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/v59kaj2xapk61.png?width=914&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2530b261ce274a75e989677eb7eb32a7e5fad028&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now why you might ask losing roughly 50% of your entire capital important? If you are an autist, and I know you are, let me explain.&lt;/strong&gt; I mentioned this in my last post, but essential without capital, &lt;strong&gt;how can HF run effective short latter attacks as we saw after the enormous initial spike? They can&amp;#39;t- or at least we hope- with what we have seen over the past few days, GME has not seen any significant short latter attacks, heck we have gone up $20 alone this week!!! (EVEN WITH THE MARKET SHITTING ITS PANTS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;With contracts being exercised last week at around $55 dollars, we saw a gamma squeeze occur.&lt;/strong&gt; Now I have seen 5+ people on here explain wildly differing theories ranging from, if we hit 130 it will trigger the next squeeze, or on 3/15 the squeeze will happen! Now we can all take this with a grain of salt, after all, we are apes. &lt;strong&gt;But what we can do is hold and continue to break resistance, yesterday was $113, today it was $120.&lt;/strong&gt; In my opinion, if we continue to rise steadily we can trigger another ITM call and see another squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/w55we4o6dpk61.png?width=933&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e211a49e42220b19f3998f6c764a4dbd428c5bb0&quot;&gt;F ROBINHOOD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;strong&gt;I know that to your paper hands this will kill you, but if the squeeze never happens GME is a great long-term hold. Here is why:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-They have landed a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; multi-year deal with micro soft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7dvfklepdpk61.png?width=993&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c5b6fb6667ffa99e41bb73b473f9ecb0f25e8f9d&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/7dvfklepdpk61.png?width=993&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c5b6fb6667ffa99e41bb73b473f9ecb0f25e8f9d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;They fired their insanely incompetent CFO Jim Bell,&lt;/strong&gt; seriously look him up dude was a douche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this shows seriously &lt;strong&gt;promising financial redevelopment for GME.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/q5m4zzdjepk61.png?width=939&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=44bddf0d683a160630575ae539c13438fff57204&quot;&gt;STILL F ROBINHOOD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;New wave of modernization in the gaming world. As a gamer myself, not to brag, I would love to see GME rise and take over as the ultimate streaming platform, and with the new push for the future and deals that just landed, I think that there is a pretty good chance this will happen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL:DR- IMO I think we have this. There is clear panic on the HF sides, we are up $20 from Monday with a shit ass entire market, there have been no outstanding short latter attacks, HF is down billions with high interest, there is a flood for a &amp;quot;NEW SQUEEZE RKT&amp;quot; (DISTRACTION), we have been stable and we are holding. IMO if we break resistance at 130, there will be some serious momentum.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN SORT HOLD THE MF LINES RETARDS- I am not an advisor we just like the stock.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Not sure how many people are familiar with the psychedelic space, but I’m here to tell you guys a bit about mindmed and the space as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic investment thesis is this: current available mental health treatments such as adderall, Xanax, suboxone, etc simply dull out, or put a temporary bandaid on the issue. After looking at the efficacy rates for issues such as smoking cessation, PTSD, treatment resistant depression, etc, it is clear that psychedelics could turn into a massive industry that disrupts the way we treat mental health. This could lead mind medicine and other similar companies to multi billion dollar buyouts from big pharma companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of fantastic companies in the space, but mindmed is by far my favourite. For full disclosure I’m currently long ~100k warrants, already up bigly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindmed has a diverse pipeline for a multitude of issues, plenty of cash for future R&amp;amp;D, and plenty of fantastic partnerships in academia/pharma. Additionally, this stock cannot be traded yet by anyone on robinhood due to it being on the OTC market. A nasdaq uplist (expected) would open the floodgates to a ton of new retail buyers. There is also EXTREMELY low institutional ownership, basically 0%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a market cap of 1.5 billion Canadian dollars, this can easily be a 10 bagger once there is more media attention surrounding it, and more progress is made regarding clinical trials. People are not talking about the psychedelic space yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last thing before I start seeing this in the comments, this does NOT at all compare to the weed industry. There are far more barriers to entry, addresses a totally different market (recreational vs medicinal), and has the added advantage of interest from big pharma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m aware this isn’t very detailed or anything, I don’t have the patience to put together a full DD post. I’m simply encouraging everyone in this group to do consider what this company has going for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we recently got NIO&amp;#39;s 2020 Q4 and full year financial results. Some highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) $2.5 billion reached for annual revenue &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Gross margins grew to 17.2%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Positive full year operating cash flow &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) $6.5 billion in the war chest as of 31st of December 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Q1 deliveries expected to be above 20,000 EVs &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, NIO has shown amazing improvements; they&amp;#39;ve definitely come a long way, and to anyone who can look at the results honestly, it&amp;#39;s evident that NIO will be much higher in the future. One of the reasons I say this is because of what we&amp;#39;re seeing from the media trying to spin this situation negatively; and while it is true that anxiety regarding semiconductors and batteries can limit NIO&amp;#39;s production, from the information we have, it doesn&amp;#39;t appear it will have much of an effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the earnings call, NIO&amp;#39;s CEO Willie Li Bin (NIOgang&amp;#39;s homeboy) said that NIO will be producing 7,500 EVs in the second quarter 2021 until July wherein the production capacity will increase to 12,500--meaning an annual 150,000 EV production; it&amp;#39;s also knows that this will potentially double again to 300,000 in 2022--meaning 25,000 NIO EVs produced a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also be knows that yes NIO&amp;#39;s deliveries were down in February, but this is due to the Lunar new year holiday; literally people were not at work. But interestingly, NIO delivered 5,578 in February, beatings Xpeng&amp;#39;s 2,223. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go to some of the forums like Stocktwits or Twitter, there&amp;#39;s bears/shorts deliberately trying to scare people to sell--as if what&amp;#39;s written above is bad news. Here&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/chinese-tesla-rival-nio-chip-shortage-will-hit-electric-car-production.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; for the &amp;#39;bad news&amp;#39; these fearmongers are dragging out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the supposed EPS miss by NIO: as the analyst Edison Yu points out, the EPS miss is misleading because it was actually due to the FX loss (the weak USD hurting NIO&amp;#39;s cash balance). Basically not NIO&amp;#39;s fault. Here&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/edison__yu/status/1366538414271660032&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to his statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that NIO is ramping up production (remember that even at 7,500 this is more than their monthly deliveries in 2020); the fact that NIO has openly said they&amp;#39;re entering Europe in H2 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/03/19912404/nio-to-begin-exporting-evs-to-europe-in-second-half-of-2021-report&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;); the fact they have $6.5 billion now; the fact that production will be 12,500 from July, and 25,000 in 2022--all of these show how much of a winner NIO is, and why NIOgang will stay strong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But watching all the negativity, it definitely reminds me of last year around this time, before NIO went up over 1,000%. I think it could happen again. I think about it while I&amp;#39;m at work; and I remember that it was Reddit where I first found NIO, and NIOgang&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve gotten fantastic news recently; don&amp;#39;t let the haters drag us down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

I had no idea what I was doing. Although, I did know a little about ETFs. So I decided to buy VTI and a couple of other ETFs at around the $120/$200mark. With some leftover cash, I pumped money into stocks that I read in news articles. That&amp;#39;s right, I would look up &amp;quot;the best stocks of march 2020&amp;quot; and basically buy the first thing on the list on some random article. I guess I got lucky and made about 4k - a 30% return overall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes GME, BB, AMC, etc. I basically lost about $2500 total because of FOMO. That chewed up a lot of my profits, but it was okay because it was money I could lose. I&amp;#39;m glad that it wasn&amp;#39;t worse. It was a huge eye-opener though because I realized that I had around 5-8k in certain stocks that I did absolutely 0 research on besides using the google search bar. Likely these investments could&amp;#39;ve dropped to 0 but thankfully didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment I lost that amount of money on the speculative stocks, I liquidated all my positions except for some ETFs. It didn&amp;#39;t matter if I was up or if the stock was likely to get gain xx%. I decided that as a DYI investor, I needed to understand fundamentals: reading and analyzing statements, industrial comparison, etc. I also needed to have a general understanding of the economy, and maybe even understand Technical Analysis. I needed to become a prudent investor and not invest unless I understood every aspect of the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I missed out on a lot of gains these past X months (besides my ETFs), but I have no regrets. I will continue learning each and every day until I&amp;#39;m confident enough to invest again. Even then I could lose money but at least I&amp;#39;ll know I tried my best. I would also like to encourage anyone else that doesn&amp;#39;t have a sense of what&amp;#39;s going on to take a step to the side and look at the situation. If you are reading someone&amp;#39;s DD and 1/2 of the terms don&amp;#39;t make sense, it&amp;#39;s probably a good idea to take a step to the side to learn about them before doing blind investing (gambling).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: MSFT wants what GOOL and AAPL have – Android and iOS. Windows is shit. Buying BB makes MSFT instant dominant car OS vender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Software defined vehicle&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like the evolution of cell phones. You used to buy new flip phones in order to get new features, now hardware and software on smart phones are updated separately. Vehicles are the next app platform. Vehicle software will be the next frontier for innovation. Every major player will want to sell you apps, services, and show you ads in your car. Unlike smart phones, Microsoft has not lost the battle in software defined vehicle space yet. The time for Microsoft to do something about it is now, and the fastest way to get a foot in the door is by acquiring BB. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much is each smart connected car worth to social media, ad platforms, cloud service platforms, etc.? A quick web search “social network value per user” says Facebook will generate $226 per user in the U.S. in 2021. Let’s say each U.S. driver is worth additional $50 to Facebook per year, $150 to all other social media and ad platforms combined. I’m being extremely conservative here; car users are captive audiences while phone users often are not. Users should worth more to social media companies when they’re in the car. The U.S. alone has over 270 million vehicles. That’s half a trillion total addressable market. That is just social media in the U.S., how about services and other apps we don’t know we need yet? All in, this can easily be a multi-trillion-dollar market. We haven’t even touched commercial vehicles and taxis yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Microsoft needs a secure real-time OS that’s not Windows.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Ford’s Sync is an embarrassment to both Ford and Microsoft – source I bought my first and last Ford about 10 years ago. Ford kicked Microsoft to the curb in favor of QNX sometime ago. Ford is replacing QNX with Android from Google. Microsoft needs to redeem itself with Azure Cloud connected infotainment system running on a secure real-time OS. A proven secure platform is going to pitch well against Android and Linux based systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has CarPlay and Google has Android Auto, and Microsoft is practically absent in infotainment space. CarPlay and most instances of Android Auto runs on QNX based systems. More specifically they rely on QNX’s Projection system. Basically, the apps run on your phone, and “project” the display via QNX and QNX sends control signals (touch screen, button press, etc.) to the phone app. If you’re huge company who wants a piece of the car software pie, but no one uses your Windows phone, what can you do? You can bundle your software with the car! Build it into the car’s OS, for free! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would love to pull another Internet Explorer vs Netscape Navigator if they can control the car OS. Only in this case Apple and Google are not the underdog Netscape was. Apple and Tesla will do their own thing, but for the majority of auto makers who already use QNX, the easy thing to do is keep using QNX if it is good enough and backed by MSFT’s engineering power. A MSFT own QNX can even be free or less than free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Monolithic Kernel vs Micro Kernel&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Windows is not suitable for cars, and it can’t be fixed. BlackBarry’s QNX Neutrino RTOS, based on microkernel architecture, is inherently more secure than monolithic kernel such as Linux. Microsoft Windows has hybrid kernel and by some measures has worse security track record. When your email, IM, and text can be shown on your car’s screen or read aloud via your car’s audio system. Security will be a major concern for consumers and government agencies. Microsoft owned QNX has a real chance of dominating Android and upcoming Apple Car OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see increasing chatter about MSFT may benefit from a BB acquisition so I did some DD before start buying BB stock. I believe after MSFT lost the smart phone battle, car software and OS are MSFT’s once in a generation second chance. BB enterprise value is about 6 billion. I can see MSFT spend 20+ billion in stock and cash to buy BB. I write code for a living and thinks he understands markets he has little to no knowledge of. I’m not a financial advisor. I spent a lot of my time on GitHub and various programming chatrooms. I may have read something on the web that give me this idea, or it may be all in my head. I honestly can’t tell. I do not have any direct or indirect knowledges pertinent to MSFT and BB’s technical or management decisions. Invest at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: 500 shares at 13.80 and some calls spread over 17 to 20 range.&lt;/p&gt;
