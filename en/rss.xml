&lt;p&gt;My grandfather is an old-school conservative meaning he values honesty, respect for the family, honor, respect for traditions, hard work, patriotism/racist nationalism type of nonsense, and believes in the traditional family model is better for society. Also, my grandfather states that society in the past was better mostly in terms of economics and culture. Like people were better back in the day and were more honest, and it&amp;#39;s said that more countries are throwing away their own cultures just to be more western.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started having a conservation with my grandfather about whether, or not, I should go back to college for a philosophy/creative writing degree. I explained to my grandfather that another option was to become a tradesman like an electrician. Of note his also a retired electrician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tried to explain by using logical examples in the real world, and used publish data with statistics. He said &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with liberal arts degrees if that&amp;#39;s your passion. However, it&amp;#39;s kinda different back in my day, where if you got a degree it actually met something to the employer and showed the employer that you either were above intelligence or were insanely hard-working. Now, everyone has a degree and it&amp;#39;s flooded the market more. So, unless you are going into engineering, or STEM what is a marketable skill. I think you should stay away from these degrees&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I love my grandfather. But, I just disagree with him on a lot of other issues. Another example is that he tells me that society was better back in his day in terms of economics and feels sorry for the younger generations like me Gen Z and how it&amp;#39;s going to be even harder for future generations to even own a house, and how societies are changing, but it&amp;#39;s in a bad way like losing your native culture, and automation becoming into play. Meaning people who built up careers and worked hard for are going to be out of employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He offered another suggestion like go into the skilled trades like being an electrician it&amp;#39;s well paid and very unlikely to be automated out of existence. And, suggested play to your strengths and weaknesses. If you are good at math either go into the electrical trade or engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I love my grandfather. But, I just disagree with him a lot like a more progressive thinking person. Additionally, what my grandfather said was this final piece of life advice he suggested. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Son, I love you dearly but be prepared for some of your views on things to change with experience and age. I used to be very idealistic and young as well. However, this is a very different world, I came into when I was your age. Now, you need to more cunning and adaptable to today&amp;#39;s society and work hard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, he&amp;#39;s right on some things, but that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean just being older you know better. He once stated to me that, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;You, know, I may be old, but I&amp;#39;m not stupid, I&amp;#39;ve done my research and just looking out for you son, you&amp;#39;ll get further in life with self-education like reading books on investing, and finance&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit shocked he even knew the names of current generations like millennial, gen z, and gen xer, and modern-day terms. Yes, I get it even in old age you can still be adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;

This evidently applies to their own citizens. However obtaining those documents generally has a cost. IMO such documents should always be free for a citizen. Lack of income should never make someone automatically illegal, nor complying with the law should have a non-income/asset based cost. Furthermore you should never be forced by law to buy a service; either you charge in the form of taxation (based on income, activity and/or assets), or you have it free. Forcing to buy goes against any logic of consumer choice, and should instead be done through a mandatory tax, or simply not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: exception can be made for consular services, as those are essentially a favor the country of origin does to its expats. So long as they can have it free in their homeland and are allowed to return (there exists adhoc traveling documents for undocumented people). Leaving was a choice, after all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note2: please don&amp;#39;t just reply &amp;quot;my country doesn&amp;#39;t require you to have an ID therefore you are wrong&amp;quot;. A few countries are like that, of course, but it&amp;#39;s not the point of this post. It&amp;#39;s a more general case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure at what age I would suggest the retest takes place, but I believe it should be done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main point behind this is that it would make the roadways a safer place, not just for other drivers, but for older folks driving as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I’d like to give &lt;del&gt;3&lt;/del&gt; 4 personal anecdotes which explain my position:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I had a neighbor (in his late 70s) who was killed in a car accident where he pulled out in front of an 18 wheeler. His physical health had been deteriorating for a while now and although this could happen to anyone at any age I believe it to be a result of his age and physical decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandma has Alzheimer’s and in the earliest stages of it she ran a stop sign and t-boned another vehicle. I find it unlikely this would have happened had she been retested, because she probably wouldn’t have been declared fit to drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was cut off while traveling 45MPH and tboned a car very violently. Both our cars were totaled and although I escaped with minor injuries, the driver (elderly) who cut me off suffered a few broken bones. Both the witnesses who pulled over and the police very quickly determined it was his fault. (Also he tried to sue me after wtf!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got cut of today by an older gentleman and was about 2 feet away from slamming into his bumper had I not been paying attention, it would’ve been a pretty bad accident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident is what reminded me about how I think we could make the roads safer for all by reevaluating who in our elderly population is still fit to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a cooking video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another time, I posted a video in which I talked about my past with self-harm issues. Again, more people telling me to put a trigger warning. I’m sorry, but no. You’re offended by me using a knife to cook? It’s a cooking utensil. Get over it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re set off by me talking about my past experiences with self harm? Get over it. It’s my story, and I’m going to tell it the way I wish. The world doesn’t have a trigger warning for you, and neither do I. Maybe I’m wrong though, who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m hoping to learn from people more informed than myself about corporate and criminal law in the USA.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My basic understanding is that one reason that corporations are able to spend extravagant funding on political campaigns in the USA is that (a) they have been ruled to legally count as &amp;#39;people&amp;#39; and (b) money has been ruled to be a form of speech - hence donating money to political campaigns is a constitutionally protected right. I personally am opposed to both of these ideas, but if we&amp;#39;re stuck with them, I don&amp;#39;t see why we  shouldn&amp;#39;t come up with some additional ways of criminally punishing corporations beyond fines small enough to just be a cost of doing business. For example, instead of just fining companies, why not prohibit them from doing any business for some amount of time (ie &amp;#39;imprison&amp;#39; them)? They might be prohibited from selling, transporting, purchasing, or manufacturing products, purchasing labor, and a freeze could be placed on trading their stock. This seems like it might actually provide corporations with good reasons to avoid criminal behaviour, instead of just pulling some extra money out of them as compensation for their continued sociopathy.&lt;/p&gt;

They are deadly but not overly supernatural. They should embody the typical bite and bodily fluid types of infection, with &lt;del&gt;instantaneous&lt;/del&gt; 1 hour incubation times. (Sad to change such a vital piece of info, but a user made a brilliant point on how it would be self-contained if it was instantaneous) Edit: 100% infection rate. All of them should have dull intelligence. Their speed, however, is fast. *as in they can run. In the end, they are still vulnerable to wearing down after a year or so. To kill these monsters, it would need a shot to the brain. Under the assumption that it starts with patient zero in a random place across the world, and does not take down a significant part of our population all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all considering that they do not have help from the dragons or other supernatural phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why I believe the world would reign victorious:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our media is saturated with zombie apocalypse films. It has been an idea so heavily fancied, large portions of the population would already be mentally prepared and know what to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if whole countries are torn to the bones by zombies, even if a single country survives it will be able to launch a worthy counterattack. Taking superpowers like the US and Russia, for example, as long as either of them are able to semi-effectively repel the zombies and adapt, the zombies would be fcked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of my pet peeves is the portrayal of many militaries in zombie films. From movies that originated from all across the world, the military is somewhat useless. At the end of the day, the main character is usually shown to be even more capable than the military. This is far from the truth. I doubt any zombies could truly wipe out any decent military.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are already contingency plans. This one relates to topic 1 and 3. At this point in time, many people and even governments already know how to deal with the apocalypse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that doesn’t look like it will happen any time soon, I think think more requirements should happen in order for a positive outcome of the prisoners. The system as is does nothing to really keep people out. Recidivism rates are upwards of 40%+ in some states. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think… if an individual has continued to work and help make a profit for a company for years, that company should have no issue with the individuals output. Yes, it can be said not having much of a choice and fewer distractions lead to something the person may not do on their own time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I think it should be required if good work and behavior are put in, that person is should take precedence and be hired on. The company would also be responsible for halfway housing for up to a set amount of time until their new employee pays rent on their own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a way that could help lower the recidivism rate and crime. You put someone’s hands to work and they are no longer idle. Then hopefully they relocate the person from people they know. I know some people might want to be around family and friends… but those are probably some of the first people to get you back into the life of crime. Not going back home to them is probably the best and having an easy way elsewhere would be positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it is very natural for agreeing groups of people to stick together, so just because a couple of thousand people have your back on a subject doesn’t mean the majority of an entire country would agree. Even if a million people were on your side that’s still well under 1% of the US. Stay kind, keep learning, and be open minded, different viewpoints are what drive free countries forward.

&lt;p&gt;There is a popular book by a prominent neuroscientist (the title is escaping me at this point, possibly I will edit it in later), that starts off with him describing what he would like to do to Hitler. He talks about wanting to be able to have him alone in a room, tied to a chair, and all the painful things he would be inspired to do to him. And therein lies a big problem, he suggests, because the same mental processes that allow him to justify that cruel treatment of another human being, are the same ones that allowed Nazis to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this will be a point of contention for some, but it is clear to me as a traveler of social media, that often those with radical and passionate ideology on the liberal side of the spectrum, who might be the strongest advocates for hate speech laws, are themselves frequently &lt;em&gt;very hateful people&lt;/em&gt;. And it makes sense: In order to hate, something has to matter to you in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychopaths, unless given reasons connected to personal harm, are frequently indifferent to people, and might both not understand why you care so much in a certain situation, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; why you hate so much. A psychopath would not understand why I watch a documentary about conditions in North Korea, and get inspired to march an army in there tomorrow and personally punch Kim Jong-Un in the dick. It is extraordinarily difficult to recognize and overcome these thought processes, which are primally ingrained in us, and it is also not clear and obvious that it is never ever good to have them. Certainly, history shows us that those prone to strict pious notions about such things frequently fail to live up to it, and wind up being hypocrites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, people gonna hate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem is this: Speech and dialogue are how we figure things out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speech is how we play with and explore ideas. Frequently we have to be wrong first, and bounce our ideas off of other sources, before we can be right (gee, I wonder if there&amp;#39;s a subreddit devoted to that notion somewhere...). Sometimes we have to go down a path of thought and see where it takes us. Sometimes we have to play devil&amp;#39;s advocate. Sometimes we have to posit open questions to understand how difficult getting clear answers truly is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, it&amp;#39;s only the deepest of fools who thinks, &amp;quot;Nope, no need for that anymore, we&amp;#39;ve got &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; answers, and so it is totally appropriate for us just to stop and correct and censor all who don&amp;#39;t concur,&amp;quot; right? Of course humanity is nowhere close to &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; answers, and perhaps those who think they have them are the ones who most need to be challenged through open speech and expression in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this doesn&amp;#39;t even start to venture into creative and artistic processes. One approach in great literary works in history have taken, is to start with an indefensible idea, and then proceed to do their utmost to defend it. And we certainly all know that literature has to be free to contain immoral or hateful characters, and be free to explore the truth of things without tying it all up in a bow. The novel &lt;em&gt;American Psycho&lt;/em&gt; does not preach to you about what a horrible person Patrick Bateman is, it just describes his thoughts and actions, and leaves it to you what to think about it. Vladimir Nabokov does not end &lt;em&gt;Lolita&lt;/em&gt; with a diatribe about the need to fight child abuse, he simply gives you characters, and let&amp;#39;s you alone to parse the truth in their situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapper Eminem wrote a song about the process of kidnapping and murdering his ex-wife. And that&amp;#39;s hardly only a recent thing - Johnny Cash wrote about killing a man in Reno just to watch him die. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/wutPsl41saE&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; track has an old blues singer talking about his intent to cut the letters of the alphabet into his girlfriend&amp;#39;s skin for going out at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even recently thought of how an old Gilbert and Sullivan song could be loosely construed as hate speech. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve Got a Little List&amp;quot; is a song about collections of people in society who &lt;em&gt;no one would miss if they died&lt;/em&gt;. Is that saying it&amp;#39;s good to kill those people? Is it violent in nature, or advocating of violence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, myself, have done some exploring of the dark corners of my brain, and come up with some really dark creative ideas involving hate. The lyrics I come up with are, on their surface, deeply racist, sexist, and maybe just plain insane at times. I very much would love to share these ideas with people on social media, with the intent of what most artistic expression hopes to do: Figure out who we are. If there is honest truth in what I create, then it teaches us something about ourselves, and in doing so, gives us tools for better understanding, and subsequently equips to form a better society. Sounds good, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, but if we allow you to do stuff like that, and all you have to say is that your intent is good, then everyone else can just claim good intent and say whatever they want!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, yes. But the alternative is to use a standard other than intent, and how do we do that? Subjective offense? Banning certain words? Banning certain ideas from being talked about at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, what about venting? I&amp;#39;ve often thought about the weird fact that there are subreddits that claim to exist for the primary purpose of venting, like &lt;a href=&quot;/r/offmychest&quot;&gt;r/offmychest&lt;/a&gt;, and yet those subreddits are highly censoring. I don&amp;#39;t know about you, but I really wish someone could go on that subreddit and say &amp;quot;I feel like going into a crowd and shooting a bunch of people today&amp;quot; as a way to express their pain and discontentment, get it out of themselves and feel better for it, and maybe even receive compassion and understanding that helps defuse their anti-social thoughts and plug them back into humanity. As opposed to, you know, &lt;em&gt;actually shooting people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, but our hate speech guidelines only include certain things as hate speech, so that makes it okay.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it doesn&amp;#39;t at all. First of all, it reflects a biased opinion not just about ideas, but which people with which ideas are allowed to be hateful to other people. Second of all, as I suggested, people speak out of emotion sometimes, and need to, and surely we as fellow humans understand that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;But if we don&amp;#39;t have these rules, the evil people we disagree with will take over and chaos will reign!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, I indeed think that&amp;#39;s what the people who most advocate for these rules are most afraid of. And I think it&amp;#39;s a less rational fear than they perceive. I do not agree with the right wing in the USA, but I do believe that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of them are not bad people. I think sometimes people say things to get a rise out of people, or out of anger, or to troll and make the people who annoy them have a conniption. I think the actual number of sinister evil plotters is actually quite tiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, the idea that we have to enact extreme measures to protect society is 1. Shared by those on the Right, who are doing their own inappropriate things to counteract the Left, and 2. A common trope of moral panic through history that almost always turns out to be wrong and damaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as I have already written more than I bet most people will wind up reading, I will digress at this point, and leave it open to counterargument. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also just want to note that while I indeed think I have a very solid argument here, I know some people strongly disagree, and I am, as always, open to nuance and things I am not considering. So, CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to understand and see reasons why this might be true but nobody that accused him of being killed by someone else, either refused to answer or was just rude &amp;quot;just google it&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did, but google only reinforced my view, drugs,sex slaves,murder, slowly losing his mind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at his tweet he seemed like a madman. The videos he released. Its all just an old,sad and crazy man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,regarding some alleged assasination attempts i couldnt find anything, i doubt a old crazy man could survive multiple attempts at his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the biggest reason why im sure that he killed himself, is the fact that he was about to be moved back to the USA for his crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would someone want him dead a few weeks before being faced with his crimes, possibly getting a huge prison sentence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im curious for the opinions and arguments that think he got killed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that making decisions to share your naked body with strangers is going to bite you in the ass at some point in your life. whether its psychologically going to mess you up, or physically. as in, folks you don&amp;#39;t want to see those photos may get access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like it takes a special type of person to feel powerful in sex work, and power to those who make it work without it destroying their inner psyche. but normalizing this for people who have no idea what the true consequences of this behavior can&amp;#39;t be good. im thinking young people who just turn 18, thinking that its an ok thing to do, because a lot of people are doing it so &amp;quot;why not make some extra cash? I mean its not like im doing &lt;em&gt;porn&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and im not at all trying to say &amp;quot;we shouldn&amp;#39;t be sexual&amp;quot; but what we are doing is being grotesquely sexual. sex is a very powerful, beautiful thing. but we are treating it like its this fleeting, unimportant thing. or that&amp;#39;s how im assuming others are treating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyways I think that&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m aware that people are against the death penalty for things like false convictions and the cost of appeals. But what if they were given the option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits would include: Less money spent on housing and feeding inmates, Violent offenders that choose this route would not be able to harm others who have a chance of life on the outside, and while the death penalty would technically still exist, it would be a much more affordable means compared to the current system with it where there are appeals after appeals for every death penalty given out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside that some might mention would be it being inhumane to sentence someone to death. But if that&amp;#39;s what the person wants, why let them live with no hope. If you&amp;#39;re stuck in prison for decades, with no hope of getting out, what&amp;#39;s there to look forward to? What is there to make yourself a better person for? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s no reason for someone to rehabilitate and reform in prison, and they dont want to live in miserable conditions that have been noted in US prisons, with no hope of ever getting out, why not let them take the death penalty instead of possibly suffering a painful death at the hands of themselves or another inmate?

In response to this ruling, there has been social media backlash (in particular on Instagram) saying that these puberty blockers are &amp;quot;completely reversible&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;trans youth should be able to make these decisions over their own body&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without mentioning that one can present as the opposite gender WITHOUT hormonal treatment and puberty blockers, these medications are far from as benign as people say they are. Although the idea that they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;completely reversible&amp;quot; holds SOME water, there&amp;#39;s not enough evidence to support that there&amp;#39;s not profound changes in their mental development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, these medications (such as Lupron) were never designed or properly tested for this use. They have immense side effects and should not be taken lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do believe SOME transgender people under 16 know for sure and this could benefit them, but at the end of the day most kids under the age of 16 have no idea what they&amp;#39;re getting themselves into. Puberty blockers may help transition however at the end of the day they&amp;#39;re not a strict requirement, and i personally would rather be safe than sorry with something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;My main problem is not with the purpose of the income tax, but rather &lt;strong&gt;how overwhelming the tax burden lies on the middle and upper middle class relative to that of corporations.&lt;/strong&gt; Effective tax rates as of right now in the United States would have typical corporations paying around the low 20&amp;#39;s%; loopholes in the accounting system for depreciating assets and stock options permit their actual payment to be well under their &amp;quot;fair worth&amp;quot;. Meanwhile, an employed American who has an income somewhere around the middle class can expect 30% or more of their paycheck to be gone. Corporations, who only exist to feed investors, are paying lower effective rates than typical employees who have kids to feed or people to guard. &lt;strong&gt;After being so responsible for the tax burden already, why raise income tax even more?&lt;/strong&gt; I could be missing something in this picture but, to me, it looks like a simple case of flipping the tax burden onto corporations instead of raising income tax even further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second issue; &lt;strong&gt;raising the income tax&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;even further&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;as a way of fighting income inequality perpetuates the economic fallacy that high salary = wealth.&lt;/strong&gt; The signifier for wealth is &lt;strong&gt;net worth, NOT how much you make today.&lt;/strong&gt; The young new lawyer, doctor, or pharmacist who has 6 figure loan balances and is only their first year out making big bucks is far poorer than the engineer whose been working since college. Several traditional  professions with those sweet salaries are incredibly misleading for the actual entry cost they demanded, and just because you command a mid 6 figure income after many years doesn&amp;#39;t mean &lt;em&gt;poof, a Lamborghini and mansion appears and you&amp;#39;re not paying your fair dues to society&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#39;m not saying we should base the tax system on asset allocation, but I&amp;#39;m just asking people to get this false equation of high salary = wealth out of their head. &lt;strong&gt;This way any politician who campaigns for a movement on behalf of the economic &amp;quot;common man&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t come for your paychecks and understands that one&amp;#39;s salary doesn&amp;#39;t imply they&amp;#39;re rich and hoarding from society.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Politicians know this is the case but they&amp;#39;re so in bed with corporations anyway; we as voters need a way to fight this by knowing more about how dumb the income tax is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The villains of wealth inequality and abysmal tax allocation in the US are equity owners in corporations. Come for their necks, not the broke pharmacist who works at your CVS. Go for the corporations and I guarantee you, even the slightest percentage point enforced properly (without those loopholes) will lead to millions in tax revenue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Now... to get the feds to properly &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; the money? That&amp;#39;s a whole other thing.&lt;/p&gt;

For example normal store fronts would have you purchase a product, take if home, find out it’s defective and rather than offering an exchange, they would ask you to deal remotely with the manufacturer resulting in 3 hour+ hold times and numerous months for replacement which still had to be shipped to store fronts. This is just a common example I’ve seen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covid is coming to a close and companies are still practicing this level of laziness. I think the new normal is going to be garbage customer service and sky high prices. We have nobody to blame but ourselves and we should have driven the offending businesses out of business for such practices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you yourself have any examples of this please speak up because I’m struggling to recall every example I’ve seen since March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

This belief has been mounting for a while, but I&amp;#39;ll admit that the impetus for this post is somewhat reactive. I just saw a NYT article summary that read, &amp;quot;I Am Always Out of My Lane: The debate on reopening schools was toxic. Just ask Emily Oster, an economist who . . .&amp;quot; I think this sucks, for numerous reasons. First, I don&amp;#39;t like seeing journalistic language cheapen itself at the same pace as low-value Twitter discourse. But more importantly, to me, a term like &amp;quot;toxic&amp;quot; generally insinuates a lot about systemic and cultural malfeasance within an organization or group, but is just as often lazily used as a synonym for &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; that allows people to draw &lt;em&gt;inferences&lt;/em&gt; about bigotry, sexism, or some other systemic malfeasance without any offer of proof. In this headline, it&amp;#39;s basically just meaningless and annoying to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we do see it all the time with more harmful consequences. &amp;quot;The office culture there is toxic&amp;quot; is a phrase someone might use when describing burnout, overtime, and other labor abuses in an industry. By using a term like &amp;quot;toxic&amp;quot; they allow listeners to think the worst of the worst about the culture--that it&amp;#39;s prejudiced, that the leaders are unrepentant bigots, etc.--with plausible deniability, because no slanderous accusations about bigotry were &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; made. This is dangerous, because we see more and more that people are ready and eager to out each other as nonspecifically &amp;quot;problematic&amp;quot; in the never-ending game of mutually assured reputational destruction over nothing but vague allegations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this phenomenon is something that needs to be recognized so we can begin the disarmament process, and not allow people to get away with implying the worst about others while putting very little on the line, in terms of their own future trustworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll check back in the morning, but I would also like to apologise before I go. I think I formatted the post pretty badly, as well as getting sucked into a tangent argument, meaning that I didn’t get my point across very well, and then reinforced the wrong point in the comments. By this stage, it’s a bit late to fix, but I should have focused more on the hypothetical ethics rather than the actual feasibility of doing this. If you still want to reply whilst I’m asleep, please focus on the ethics. Should the person be penalised for holding the views if they don’t matter?&lt;/p&gt;

Of course it seems like a sale if an item is $800 instead of $1500, but the original price listed often not even what the item is really worth. And as with Black Friday plenty of products that are listed on sale are the cheaper version of something, or a model that will soon be discontinued to make way for the newer model of the product. Many TVs bought on Black Friday would often end up broken sooner rather than later because they were never instead to last unbeknownst to the consumer who just saw a huge screen size TV for a lower than usual price. And because so many companies decided to have &amp;quot;Black Friday&amp;quot; multiple times a year, it gives more of a unique advantage to Amazon since if something actually is just only a couple a days and you know you won&amp;#39;t see those &amp;quot;deals&amp;quot; again there is more of an urgency to the situation and more pressure for customers to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer scam is just a vague way to attempt to describe it, but if you don&amp;#39;t quite understand what I mean by it, refer to the way people say you should avoid going out to spend money on Black Friday and why they say that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, you can be homophobic and not-gay. That seems logical, for whatever reason, you don&amp;#39;t like gay people, doesn&amp;#39;t mean that I will agree with you or your view, but, if you don&amp;#39;t hurt anyone with your idea and principles or even reduce the rights of other people, I won&amp;#39;t have an issue with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if homophobic people are closeted gays that implies that they are worse than non-gay when it comes to tolerance of sexual preferences, since they hate themselves and people like them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thirdly, let&amp;#39;s say that you are homophobic and not gay. Do you think being called a closeted gay makes you feel better about the LGBT cause? Wouldn&amp;#39;t it make you feel even worse and hate them even more? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t see how you can portray this as something that should use to criticize others. I find it an extremely bad argument and doesn&amp;#39;t help absolutely anyone, it doesn&amp;#39;t help the cause for gay (LGBT) rights or helps others being more tolerant to each other preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to discuss this with you since I don&amp;#39;t see any point that makes this argument favourable to anybody.&lt;/p&gt;

Clearly using a costume to mock a certain culture, such as blackface or dressing up as an indigenous person as a Halloween costume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it promotes the kind of racial segregation so many have worked so hard to abolish. For example, saying a white person should not wear dreads, at the root of it, displays the same overall thinking pattern as when people wanted a pool drained because one black person swam in it. People try to act like they&amp;#39;re all woke when they whine about most instances of things they think are cultural appropriation by saying that they&amp;#39;re protecting marginalized communities by some rationale of righting past wrongs done by the ancestors of those in not so marginalized groups and somehow evening the playing field. The fact that white people are seen differently with dreads than black people, a common argument in favor of the modern paradigm of avoiding what some call cultural appropriation, is not going to be solved by saying white people should not have them. It&amp;#39;s just going to promote that black and white people are more different than they really are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all really comes down to a thought process along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This thing belongs to my group. You&amp;#39;re not in my group, so you can&amp;#39;t participate in this thing that is for my people and my people alone. If you try, I feel threatened and scared, because you&amp;#39;re different and foreign invaders into our traditions and property must be stopped.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically marginalized or not, left or right wing, most people have a tendency to try and think this way in some fashion or another, with the only difference a lot of the time being the way that thinking is packaged and worded, and it leads to a lot of unnecessary violence, stress, and strife.&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to not take on this Argument since SpaceX later on got heavily funded by NASA (after they invented the falcon 1 , merlin, Kestrel, and Draco engines).
I must confess i dont know if they still get an extra amount of money per launch like they used to get( at least i think they did), so probably the cost per Kilogramm would be much higher if they had higher Research expenses.
 Also i know that getting funded is not unusal, in my opinion it just doesnt Match the whole &amp;quot; we /I did it also by myself&amp;quot; image&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire history of the public toilet has taught us that we can&amp;#39;t rely on people to treat the utilities with any sort of respect. It only takes one person to throw the entire system into a disgusting chaos. So why do we continue to trust the system to the personal responsibility of the masses? It would be very easy to have a spring loaded toilet seat that physically required someone to be sitting on it in order to remain in the seated position. Anyone using the toilet to urinate would always enter a stall with the seat already up and out of the splash zone. The only time the seat would be exposed would be when someone intended to use it in the seated position.  &lt;/p&gt;

And this comes from days before the current pandemic, so its not the cause either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, putting aside very narrow ultraspecialized fields or very small/closed countries, I think that&amp;#39;s just a whole lot of bollocks. I&amp;#39;ll give two examples I know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Friend of mine applied to work to stack the shelves at a supermarket. She was 100% happy to earn any wage at all, and willing to work any schedule as she lived close-by. She was turned down (nothing bad there, of course, it&amp;#39;s life). However couple days down the road I got wind through contacts that this manager was complaining &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t hire anyone anymore, young people just don&amp;#39;t want to work&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the thing, during the crisis years, 2010-2017, young people got shafted hard, and instances of unpaid wage, paid below agreed upon value, unpaid work-time, and so on, became extremely common, with traditional legal solution proving almost ineffective. As a result, nowadays anyone with some education, basic knowledge of the law and a few contacts and favors (which are cheap enough) can defend themselves. And if that doesn&amp;#39;t work... well, other ways do. So what hiring managers target for unqualified position are people that will not know HOW to defend themselves, that don&amp;#39;t have contacts and friends to pull from, and so on. Essentially people that will just shrug and say &amp;quot;well, I got shafted a month wage, it&amp;#39;s life&amp;quot; if at some point that don&amp;#39;t pay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- I worked construction for a few years, a few month here, a week there, in between classes, etc. Earned about 2000-4000€/y doing that. Recently got many calls to come back, and they were offering about 5k-6k/y. Comparatively sweet. However, I finished my degree and got a more regular job, earning about 75k/y at the moment. Well, most of the companies manager I talked to were downright rude when I said &amp;quot;I earn X atm, can you do better?&amp;quot;. In fact one company I talked with went on the local news and complained that people just &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t want to work anymore&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;young people are freeloader, can&amp;#39;t hire anyone&amp;quot;. Nah mate, you&amp;#39;re just paying shit wage. This worked 5-10y ago. But nowadays the economy is better, unemployment is way down and so on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s not that there aren&amp;#39;t people to hire. Even very specific experts, you can almost always pay extra and they&amp;#39;ll come from further in the region. It&amp;#39;s that people got wise to the crisis-era tricks, and that you want to pay 2013 wages in a 2019 economy. You can&amp;#39;t hire or retain people because you give shitty conditions and nowadays people have alternatives. Simple as. And yeah, brain-drain is a thing, because you pay poorly. Pay more, retain the brains. It&amp;#39;s not rocket-science.&lt;/p&gt;

The first type is just cancelling someone from the platform where they committed egregious behavior on. If you act like a piece of shit at a bar, the bar can cancel you from stepping foot in their business in the future. If you are harassing people and being racist on Twitter, Twitter can ban you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second type of cancel culture is advocating for the person&amp;#39;s cancellation outside of just the platform where they committed egregious behavior. I&amp;#39;ve seen people go as far as getting people fired from their jobs, getting people kicked out of college, getting people evicted, etc. This is the type of cancel culture that I am focusing on in my CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I would consider myself on the left politically. However, I am against the left&amp;#39;s embrace of this second type of cancel culture because I find it very hypocritical. How can you on the one hand laugh at someone for losing their job for saying something racist or insensitive online, then on the other hand advocate for a more rehabilitative justice system where even murderers should have a path towards redemption and a normal life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see this all the time where the same people that ridicule a white person for getting fired from their job or kicked out of college will go around saying that a black guy involved in gang violence should be offered rehabilitation. Either both should be extended a path to redeem themselves, or both should be subject to retributive justice. Having one position for one type of person and another position for another shows that you are ideologically motivated, have no principles, and are hypocritical. CMV&lt;/p&gt;

Like--it&amp;#39;s not substantially more work for the server to bring you a sixty dollar bottle of wine than a five dollar shot, so why would the former substantially increase how much they get paid and the latter have a negligible impact? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What i&amp;#39;m proposing is that you should work out an amount of money that you typically tip that more-or-less equals the average dollar amount you&amp;#39;d be tipping on meals, and use that as the baseline rather than 15%. Like if your meals on average cost around 30$, you should have a baseline tip of 5$ whether you&amp;#39;re getting a 15$ meal or a 45$ meal. (That&amp;#39;s if we accept that 15% is an appropriate baseline tip--i know there&amp;#39;s a push in some areas for that to be higher. i don&amp;#39;t have a strong opinion either way but am probably vaguely supportive of people tipping more if they can afford it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might still have reasons to adjust that tip up or down. I don&amp;#39;t necessarily think you should always pay servers the same--if you&amp;#39;re staying for a long time, or having multiple courses, or have a large/disruptive party, or are going to a place with very good service or strict regulations about how the servers can act, i think those factors should increase how much you tip. And some of them are loosely correlated with expense--but I don&amp;#39;t think that correlation is strong enough to really justify using expense as a proxy instead of tipping more specifically when those factors apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages of this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-increased income stability for waiters. it&amp;#39;s still contingent on how many tables you get and whether they&amp;#39;re generous tippers or not, so hardly ideal, but now at least it&amp;#39;s not about whether the table ordered a 100$ bottle of wine or a 20$ round of shots&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-more equal for waiters at cheap places. it doesn&amp;#39;t seem right that waiting at a place with high prices is a way better-paying job than waiting at a place with low prices, all else being equal. it&amp;#39;s possible that the place with high prices is a more demanding job, but it&amp;#39;s also totally possible that it isn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-doesn&amp;#39;t require constant recalculation. You&amp;#39;ll probably only need to work out how much you should be tipping every few years as your income changes and you start being able to spend more--the rest of the time you can just give a steady dollar amount, with more for good service. Obviously I don&amp;#39;t expect you to exactly calculate the average, just give a good enough estimate that you probably aren&amp;#39;t paying less than you otherwise would overall. This is a comparatively minor issue but, well, rule of threes y&amp;#39;know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real problem with this that I&amp;#39;ve been able to see is that it bucks social convention so you&amp;#39;d seem like a dick whenever you get an expensive meal and leave a comparatively small tip, even if you&amp;#39;re actually being more fair overall. But it doesn&amp;#39;t seem right to continue tipping unfairly just to look good/fit with social norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, i&amp;#39;m also down for abolishing tipping as a practice, but what I&amp;#39;m proposing here is more of a best-practices when you go to a restaurant--I think it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious that the way to get rid of tipping is to put pressure on the restaurant owners, not to screw over the wait staff. (Not very interested in debating this part of the post though)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start off by saying I do not think the girl with down syndrome should be excluded from the yearbook photo for her perspective squad. If she didn&amp;#39;t make varsity and was on the backup squad then her photo should be on the squad that her skills allowed her to participate at. Which it seems is what happened from the article. But if she couldn&amp;#39;t do the moves required to be varsity or on any squad then they gave her a nice photo to keep for memories and published the varsity only photo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the author goes on to describe his special needs son and how he was &amp;quot;discriminated&amp;quot; against. Like being in choir but he likes to dance and move around while the choir that practiced hard to create a show for their families has the spotlight stolen by a distraction. He says they allowed him on stage for a couple of songs but then he was told to come off stage. Which seems completely reasonable. At some point the show should be about the kids that have practiced for months and not the disabled kid dancing with a choir in the background. When are the able bodied kid&amp;#39;s parents allowed to snap their photos for their memories if your son is not participating in line with everyone else? He even goes on to say his son is a non speaking autistic boy so he literally could not participate correctly and they still included him in a program about singing. He also states his sons dancing is a delight to all the audience members and only the teacher saw a problem with it. What a big assumption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also implies disabled children should be allowed to compete in competitive sports. So how does that go? Hey we are putting in our disabled kid as defensive line can you tell everyone not to try their best so we can give him some feel good memories? Hey we are putting our disabled kid in as pitcher because he really likes throwing the ball can you not smash a homer on him? At what point is hindering 60 other people&amp;#39;s time so that your child can be in the spotlight enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter currently has 3 disabled children in her 8th grade classes. She says you can tell right away because they have a helper with them at all times and her classes are being constantly disrupted by the special needs kid&amp;#39;s. She has had her hair pulled by a disabled kid. Saw two disabled kids stabbing each other with pencils to the point a resource officer had to be stationed in her math class the remainder of the year. And even has one disabled kid who soils himself and doesn&amp;#39;t shower in 3 of her classes which heavily disrupts her ability to learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe inclusion ends where other kids progress and hard work is being undermined. The people with disabled children seem not to care about the disruptions as long as their child gets to pretend they are normal; while my daughter has to compete in the real world where her grades and extracurriculars matter for her future. Does hurting 26 other kids future outweigh helping one disabled kid do slightly better in class? I do not believe so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom, aunt and cousin have been teaching for 20 years or more each and all of them say that teaching with 29 kids and 1 or 2 disabled kids is damn near impossible. The normal class was already challenging. Now tell kids that they have one period  to take a test while one kid screams every couple of minutes and is actively fighting his para. Tell the kids they have to get over the unrelenting smell of teenage bo and poop in their pants and just focus on taking their itbs test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its not ableist to exclude disruptive kids from what an entire group is doing if they cannot participate properly. Its disableist to believe that your special needs child trumps everyone else&amp;#39;s experiences and hardwork because you think they deserve it regardless of those other children and their parents feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the “arguments” against this that I’ve heard are “But (country) has problems with &lt;strong&gt;x, y, and z.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can love your country but still dislike parts of it, just the same way you can love people and dislike things they do. Nothing is perfect. Something doesn’t have to be near-perfect for it to be enjoyed or loved, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take America for example. This is where many more people will disagree with me: I love America. I love living here. I hate many aspects about it, but I love many aspects about it. I hate that for the longest time there’s been problems &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;that I can’t say due to this sub’s filters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I like that we’ve gotten &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; in the sense of abolishing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ownership of others&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, legalizing same-sex marriage, getting closer and closer to equal rights for all. There’s still lots of room for improvement, but I won’t hatefully undermine the positive changes over time due to some anti-American bias lots of people seem to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no problem with others hating countries for legitimate reasons, don’t get me wrong. I dislike countries that behead women for standing against inequality, or slaughter their people for having opinions, and other insane reasons. That being said if you hate people for loving their country, even if they are relatively quiet about it/keep it to themself, you’re an asshole. You’re allowed to, but you’re still an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berating/silencing people for having different opinions is exactly what we’ve been trying to move away from. At least I thought for years that was the goal. I’m seeing the very people who fought for a voice, silencing others. Most of the time when someone mentions anything positive about certain countries, like America again, someone will just show up with “yeah sure, but what about (bad thing)?” and insult the person simply for implying there was anything good about the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly want to know why it’s considered so bad to enjoy, like, or love your country, even if you recognize it’s faults. I don’t understand this. If someone wants to help me understand, please, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I used bold-italic in this post, it’s me censoring certain words so the automod doesn’t remove the post, thinking it’s about something else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People of reddit were correct, the title needed a rehash&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the era of polarizing politics, and the ability to more thoroughly vet your colleagues before allowing them into your &amp;#39;inner circle of friends,&amp;#39; I&amp;#39;ve come to notice that cliques of people will almost always politically lean in the same direction and with similar intensity. This is on top of liking the same foods, activities, games, and lifestyles. I personally find these interactions un-enriching, and as an echo-chamber just affirming one&amp;#39;s lifestyle and thoughts, be them good or bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my most central friend&amp;#39;s group: the common denominator is that we like cars, except no two of us drive the same manufacturer. Also, no one holds any disparaging views towards any one demographic, so it isn&amp;#39;t like any of the &amp;quot;-isms&amp;quot; are at play here. That aside, our political leanings and affiliations are different and we value differing public policies, drug usage varies from straight edge to daily, we all preside at different economic levels, and our religious identities are all different as well. As a result we talk about these different attributes to varying degrees but there&amp;#39;s always respect so a discussion never devolves into argument. I&amp;#39;m not only critical of their beliefs but I&amp;#39;m forced to be critical of my own. In all, I prefer friends I don&amp;#39;t necessarily agree with because &lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; my own beliefs are better thought out, &lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; hearing differing thoughts and foreign facts keeps conversation fresh, and &lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; the interaction feels more genuine than ass-kissing and there&amp;#39;s no fear of being marginalized with a fringe opinion. In all, 1-3 are cause for a quality friendship which stems from disagreement without conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCP has articulated their vision in a 100 year plan for decades now, and part of it is global supremacy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen it with Hong Kong, Tibet, Taiwan and Uyghars it’s all part of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, they’ve been colonizing Africa to mine for rare earth metals. This global chip shortage is forcing the entire world to be reliant on China because almost no countries are self-reliant when it comes to sourcing and manufacturing hardware technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads me to the scariest point: impunity. Whether or not you believe that the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus Lab was the source of COVID-19, you would be silly to believe it wasn’t fishy. Scientists were silenced, borders were closed. One would believe it was intentional, which means they know they’re immune to critique. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in conclusion, CCP is the biggest threat worldwide to freedom, safety, and even health of the earth (largest contributor to CO2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any reasonably controllable variables that we should fear more than the CCP?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And something else that&amp;#39;s been on the rise is the &amp;quot;badass&amp;quot; female protaganist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;badass&amp;quot; introduction has always been quite problematic, and I&amp;#39;ll get into a specific example soon enough, it&amp;#39;s usually a small clip or monologue where a character tries to get the audience in awe of them. Typically, it goes overboard and sounds edgy as hell, and the audience loses all respect for the character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thankfully, we&amp;#39;ve seen a decrease of it, until recently, where we&amp;#39;re trying to get female protaganists to seem more badass, and as a result, making them seem shallow, insecure and unlikeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a specific example from a show on Netflix called Ragnarok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Badass&amp;quot; woman who has god-like powers comes to a martial arts gym, finds a man who&amp;#39;s practicing his wrestling, challenges him unprovoked. He looks at how small she is, and asks if she&amp;#39;s sure about it. They start to spar and the man doesn&amp;#39;t throw any hard punches until she yells at him to &amp;quot;show some respect&amp;quot; and proceeds to use her god-like powers to completely humiliate the guy, while blasting some &amp;quot;badass&amp;quot; music, and wearing a massive grin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, completely disastrous to audience in terms of respecting her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Why is a literal god wasting her time challenging random mortals that she knows she can beat without breaking a sweat within a fraction of a second?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from being pointless, it comes across as extremely insecure. What is she trying to prove?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A literal god came in the form of a petite woman just to kick some poor random mortal&amp;#39;s ass?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s like me, a fully grown man, going to a toddler who&amp;#39;s practicing karate at age 3, and beating the kid onto the ground.  Then strutting around like I was an &amp;quot;Alpha Male&amp;quot; for doing so, and being like &amp;quot;Hah! I didn&amp;#39;t even need to learn Karate to beat this kid! I&amp;#39;m so good!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this has pretty much become a universal thing in &amp;quot;badass women&amp;quot; films. It manages to be cringier than watching those &amp;quot;alpha men&amp;quot; somehow takeout an entire battalion of enemy soldiers who apparently don&amp;#39;t know how to shoot their weapon or attack at the same time instead of one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally the only message I can even concieve for these &amp;quot;badass intros&amp;quot; are &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t Judge a Book by it&amp;#39;s Cover&amp;quot;. In other words, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t assume this petite small woman with no visible muscle mass or weight could suffer serious injury if you (a trained wrestler) use all your brute force because she could secretly be an almighty god of nordic origin&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow Audiences don&amp;#39;t relate to that message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be a farfetched theory, but I think these attempts, are a result of a misunderstanding of how males organize themselves in hierarchies. Forceful Subjagation (Bullying) isn&amp;#39;t an effective means of rising in the hierarchy or getting respect, no man goes to another man, beats him into a pulp, and then earns the total respect and loyalty of the beaten and now submissive man. In fact, that&amp;#39;s a sure fire way of making enemies, losing friends, and being knocked down to the bottom of the hierarchy by a better man. Such is a dumbed-down child-like comprehension of complex human behavior. If you want to know the main factor for a male&amp;#39;s (or female&amp;#39;s) position in their respective hierarchy, it&amp;#39;s reliabilty. The more people rely on you, the higher you go. And if the people that others rely on, rely on you, then you&amp;#39;re probably at the very top of the pecking order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bit of a tangent, but does anyone else feel like that could be the case for this behavior?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw for the purposes of discussion, here are some examples of what I consider to be well-made &amp;quot;badass&amp;quot; female characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashoka Tano - Star Wars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alita - Battle Angel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scarlet Witch - Marvel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katniss Everdeen - Hunger Games&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only issue is how someone can get an ID, but we should get legislators to build more DMVs and get them to open for longer, and provide free access to an ID for people who have a verified address of residence (homeless shelter should count). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only voter suppression if a country is so poorly run the citizens can&amp;#39;t even verify themselves when they vote. It&amp;#39;s a cheat-able system. There have been times where a few tens of votes made states win. If done on a large enough scale, they can turn ties into wins for a party, which is not exactly fair. Saying because we haven’t seen people cheating we shouldn’t do it is appealing to ignorance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason the country can’t have it is because it uses its tax money so poorly it can’t ensure basic election integrity and uses “trust” as an excuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also believe that everyone is gender non-conforming in their daily lives, therefore everyone is functionally &amp;quot;non-binary.&amp;quot; No one conforms to gender norms 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender identity is based upon cultural concepts of how men and women should behave. How is this not inherently a sexist outlook? When someone says &amp;quot;I just feel like a woman,&amp;quot; it invariably means that they like culturally based (and usually sexist) views of what being a woman means to them. Liking pink or wearing dresses for example has nothing to do with being a woman. I am a woman, I don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; like one, and an itemized list of everything I do that is traditionally feminine also does not make me a woman. And the reverse is true, any masculine thing I do does not make me trans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view is called bigoted, but I think the gender identity believers are the truly bigoted ones. The only thing that matters is biological sex, everything else is culture nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

On Reddit&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;reddiquette&amp;quot; page, it says that &amp;quot;if you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it. &amp;quot;  This makes complete sense to me, and I think this is the way that we should handle ourselves on this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just as a word with an originally intended meaning can come to mean something else over time, the downvote button is not just for when a post doesn&amp;#39;t contribute to a subreddit.  It is specifically for when you dislike or don&amp;#39;t agree with something that someone has posted, despite the original intent of the button.  Here are some thoughts as to why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The upvote button, though originally intended to be for rewarding posts that &amp;quot;contribute to conversation,&amp;quot; is widely accepted as the &amp;quot;I like this&amp;quot; button.  Though it too has deviated from its original purpose, the upvote button&amp;#39;s new purpose is accepted because it&amp;#39;s not problematic.  It&amp;#39;s a reward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The upvote button was intended to be the opposite of the downvote button, and in all ways, it appears to still be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as I can tell, the vast majority of people who use the downvote button at all use it on posts they dislike.  If people use something a certain way, then that is what it is for.  The birth control pill was not originally intended as a contraceptive, but now, it is absolutely a contraceptive.  The company that makes Q-tips specifically doesn&amp;#39;t want you putting them in your ears, but Q-tips are absolutely ear-cleaners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;#39;ll say that I absolutely believe that the downvote button should be used for its originally intended purpose.  It&amp;#39;s important to be exposed to ideas that we&amp;#39;re not comfortable with, and downvoting valid posts hides valid opinions, stopping others from learning from them.  My view here is simply that the downvote button has a very distinct purpose at this time: it is for punishing a post that you dislike or disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;

Grass in general can be very difficult upkeep, on the grass on courses especially so. I imagine more than any other Sport since the quality of the grass really determines the quality of the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average golf course is 150 acres, with roughly 2 million acres. This is all land that is cultivated with the aforementioned watering plus the mowing and fertilizing. All of that land could be used for other resources that are more efficient (yes that can be said about any sport as it’s not technically a necessity, but still that is so much land dedicated to relatively few people). Even if that were turf instead of grass that is still in an enormous area dedicated to the single sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think most sporting events are wasteful as far as their usage of space, so referencing that other sports waste resources too isn’t the point, unless any other sport is more wasteful, especially considering per person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not certain if this view is particularly controversial, or if people does argue against it for the sake of arguing. But I am curious of people genuinely disagree with this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that should be the case in the US (and the world, ideally).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are antivax, I believe that shows an unacceptable level of ignorance, inability to critically think and disregard for the actual science of medical treatment, if you still want to be a physician or nurse (or NP or PA or RT etc.)  (And I believe this also should include mandatory compliance with all vaccines currently recommended by the medical science at the time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just by merit of having a license, you are in the position to be able to influence others, especially young families who are looking for an authority to tell them how to be good parents.  Being antivax is in direct contraction to everything we are taught in school (and practice) about how the human body works.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a new mother I was &amp;quot;vaccine hesitant&amp;quot;.  I was not a nurse or have any medical education at the time, I was a younger mother at 23 with a premature child and not a lot of peers for support.  I was online a lot from when I was on bedrest and I got a lot of support there. And a lot of misinformation. I had a BA, with basic science stuff, but nothing more My children received most vaccines (I didn&amp;#39;t do hep B then I don&amp;#39;t think) but I spread them out over a long period.  I didn&amp;#39;t think vaccines caused autism exactly, but maybe they triggered something, or that the risks were higher for complications and just not sure these were really in his best interest - and I thought &amp;quot;natural immunity&amp;quot; was better.  There were nurses who seemed hesitant too, and Dr. Sears even had an alternate schedule and it seemed like &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; something wasn&amp;#39;t perfect with vaccines then. My doctor just went along with it, probably thinking it was better than me not vaccinating at all and if she pushed, I would go that way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went back to school after I had my second. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I learned more in-depth about how the body and immune system worked, as I got better at critically thinking and learned how to evaluate research papers, I realized just how dumb my views were.  I made sure my kids got caught up with &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; they hadn&amp;#39;t had yet (hep B and chicken pox) Once I understood it well, everything I was reading that made me hesitant now made me realize how flimsy all those justifications were. They are like the dihydrogen monoxide type pages extolling the dangers of water. Or a three year old trying to explain how the body works.  It&amp;#39;s laughable wrong and at some level also hard to know where to start to contradict - there&amp;#39;s just so much that is bad, how far back in disordered thinking do you really need to go? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m all about the vaccinations - with covid, I was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unsure whether they&amp;#39;d be able to make a safe one, but once the research came out, evaluated by other experts, then I&amp;#39;m on board 1000000%.  I got my pfizer three days after it came out in the US.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say all this to demonstrate the potential influence of medical professionals on parents (which is when &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; people become antivax) and they have a professional duty to do no harm, and ignoring science about vaccines does harm.  There are lots of hesitant parents that might be like I was, still reachable in reality, and having medical professionals say any of it gives it a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of weight.  If you don&amp;#39;t want to believe in medicine, that&amp;#39;s fine, you don&amp;#39;t get a license to practice it.  (or associated licenses)  People are not entitled to their professional licenses.  I think it should include quackery too while we&amp;#39;re at it, but antivax is a good place to start.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tldr:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals with licenses should lose them if they openly promote antivax views. It shows either a grotesque lack of critical thinking, lack of understanding of the body, lack of ability to evaluate research, which is not compatible with a license, or they are having mental health issues and have fallen into conspiracy land from there.  Either way, those are not people who should be able to speak to patients from a position of authority.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t find holes in my logic, but I&amp;#39;m biased as a licensed professional, so I open it to reddit to find the flaws I couldn&amp;#39;t  :)&lt;/p&gt;

If the name only specified the month (e.g. June Day, similar to May Day) it wouldn&amp;#39;t be as bad, but as it stands there is a certain kind of fake precision implied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hears often, &amp;quot;If you always find a problem, you might be the problem.&amp;quot; I can totally understand that I might be the toxic/not nice one. But even then, the excluded person can be thankful, when they don&amp;#39;t have to deal with me anymore(?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is it really that easy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking, that I might spend too much time on Reddit, because in a lot of post or comments, redditors suggest this method. I&amp;#39;m feeling like in a filter bubble and I want actually to see it from a different point of view. Why I should keep in touch with someone who makes my life more complicated than I want it to be?&lt;/p&gt;
