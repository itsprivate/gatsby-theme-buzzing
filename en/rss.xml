But, I&amp;#39;ve done some research on the current financial environment of the US dollar and the economy, and we are definitely in uncharted territory. Over 20% of all USD was printed last year, and a lot of it went to buying stocks through quantitative easement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I break down investment vehicles into 4 main groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash and bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equity (stocks, real estate, anything regularly traded on the equity exchanges and has been propped up by quantitative easement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gold. You can buy this on equity exchanges but it behaves differently, so I separated it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternative Investments (baseball cards, rare antiques, piles of dogshit, whatever).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My understanding of what is currently happening:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest rates are basically 0. That means bonds are not a feasible investing vehicle. So, you can&amp;#39;t invest your cash risk free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 20% of all USD was printed in 2020. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1&quot;&gt;Just look at the M1 money supply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This money has been used to buy all kinds of financial assets (stocks, junk bonds, real estate, ETFs, etc.) which has propped up the stock market. People are also starting to speculate that assets are rising in price as a hedge against inflation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumer prices (the price of a cheeseburger) has not really changed because... this money is not being spent. It sits in the stock market because there&amp;#39;s nothing else to do with it. Do you want to open up a business right now? Go on vacation? Buy more clothes? There really isn&amp;#39;t anything to do except pay down debt and buy assets, which is what people have been doing. But the USD is still there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m under the impression that the price of equity has been rising because of both inflation and the fact that the FED is buying it up. The demand is artificial and can&amp;#39;t last forever. So, shouldn&amp;#39;t stocks be overvalued even after taking inflation into account? Shouldn&amp;#39;t we expect a big dip when things start opening back up and people want to use their cash for something that isn&amp;#39;t overvalued?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter Bitcoin. &lt;strong&gt;I would like to know people&amp;#39;s thoughts on my understanding of Bitcoin. I am not an expert.&lt;/strong&gt; It is similar to the USD in that it has no intrinsic value. The main difference is that no government can just decide to print more of it. What is the actual value of 1 bitcoin? Unlike gold or real estate, it doesn&amp;#39;t really have a true value. It can be mined, so if price sky-rockets to $1 billion then the number of miners will increase which helps stabilize prices, however I find it a better hedge against inflation than other assets because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gold. Has &amp;#39;intrinsic value&amp;#39; in that it can be worn as a sign of wealth. It also has practical uses because of its physical properties, but that doesn&amp;#39;t really affect the price. It can be used as a hedge against inflation, but unless people believe we are entering some apocalyptic scenario, there is only so much people are going to be willing to pay to wear gold on their wrist, unlike bitcoin, which isn&amp;#39;t tied to something intrinsic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash. Governments can print more, as the Fed is doing right now. You want cash on hand if you think the price of assets are going to fall. Cash right now is obviously a terrible investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equity. The reasons listed above. Artificial demand + printing money means stocks are overvalued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe real estate, since it is seen as a traditional investment and is available on equity exchanges under the form of REIT&amp;#39;s and others, has gone the way of stocks. The FED has been purchasing REITs and mortgage bonds as a part of QE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternative investments (baseball cards, piles of lumber, whatever you can think of). I find these similar to gold, but they have 1 advantage. There is only so much people are going to be willing to trade for baseball cards, however you can&amp;#39;t really buy these on equity exchanges. The FED hasn&amp;#39;t been propping up the price artificially, so why should I believe their prices can be inflated by QE? I would also like to know people&amp;#39;s thoughts on this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cons of bitcoin are that it can simply be banned. I don&amp;#39;t have the foresight or knowledge to know what kind of havoc that may cause, or what could be used to justify it. It is also a digital asset, if the nukes fall, I guess you were better off with gold or piles of lumber weren&amp;#39;t you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all coming from the point of view of an individual investor, which I am. I am not a hedge fund who has billions to invest. I have a few hundred thousand, and it&amp;#39;s extremely liquid right now. I don&amp;#39;t think the general public has caught on to the idea that maybe &amp;#39;gold that has no intrinsic value&amp;#39; might actually be a good investment vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Curious, I followed the Discord link someone had provided to a group with over 200,000 members.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know what I should do, observe or participate... so for the time being I poked around and saw the structure of it all. You can&amp;#39;t participate in any chats unless you invite someone. If you invite more people you get more bonuses... More on this later.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Deception&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s a Pump and Dump group? Well, the owner selects a coin, I presume a low volume, low Market Cap project that&amp;#39;s been dead for some time. Then they send a signal out to buy and everyone &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; market buy, then wait for the rubes on the outside (you) to think something big is happening, then they encourage participants to sell, &amp;quot;25% at a time&amp;quot; to prevent the market dumping.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, in theory, it seems like if you&amp;#39;re in, you&amp;#39;re in and nothing can go wrong. There&amp;#39;s even channels where you can help advertise the coin on social media, with links to Reddits, Tweets etc. Looks well organised and legit. With that, I decided to dip my toes and participate - if I held FUN before, and the 6-hour pump brought a 6-7x return on investment, what could happen next?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Con&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, things are different.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens is, the admin has picked a coin. This time, it was &lt;strong&gt;NEBL&lt;/strong&gt;. They have all the time to load their bags. Let&amp;#39;s say they put $10,000 into NEBL over a few weeks. The price barely moves and they have their bag ready. Then they start an announcement. &amp;quot;On January 2nd at 9PM GMT, the next coin to be pumped will be announced&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that bonus I mentioned earlier? If you invite 5 people, you get notified 1 second earlier. If you invite 10, 2 seconds earlier, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You or I may think that we all just buy at 9PM, and then when we get big profit, sell and move on. If it worked that way, then getting rich from these groups would be utterly trivial. Unfortunately, in reality, what happens is the people that get notified seconds earlier place fat buy orders, and by the time the thousands of new-ranks enter the server, it&amp;#39;s all over. They buy at X price, but that&amp;#39;s already more than enough profit for the admins and high-ranked server members, who are able to make out like bandits.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a representative example, the coin chosen today was sat at 2744 sats prior to the dump. As soon as the alert went out, I went straight to the NEBL/BTC market and market-bought with just £50 of Bitcoin - a punt to try this thing out. My market buy went in at a whopping 8998 - at my buy, they more than tripled the price of the coin in &lt;strong&gt;seconds&lt;/strong&gt;.  I don&amp;#39;t even know if it went higher because a fraction of a second later, it all crashed. Right now it&amp;#39;s sat at 0.0002472 - ironically slightly less than before.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real kicker is that as soon as they announce the coin, they close the chat. Anyone who gets trapped can&amp;#39;t get out and can&amp;#39;t alert anyone else to what&amp;#39;s happening. Right now, I&amp;#39;m speaking to 10+ people who recently posted in the chat and &lt;em&gt;every single one of them&lt;/em&gt; has lost money, some $10, some $25, one has even lost $500+  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only stress that I haven&amp;#39;t gone in to this thinking it will compose my trading strategy - I&amp;#39;ve learned that this group had nothing to do with the FUN P&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;D and there won&amp;#39;t be an extended 6-hour pump. Instead, it seems like a very well-made and elaborate con to dump the absolute bejeesus of bags onto the rubes, who aren&amp;#39;t the outsiders, but rather the 99% of users who participate thinking they are in for easy profit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody ever said there was such a thing as a free lunch&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you could get in to this 20 seconds earlier, you&amp;#39;d make money. Even better if you were the admin or his inside ring. You could make quite literally millions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in it&amp;#39;s purest art form:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accumulate coin on the sly until you have a heavy bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Announce a time to buy &lt;em&gt;secret coin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send &lt;em&gt;secret coin&lt;/em&gt; name to a small privileged group a few seconds before announcing it publicly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the chat so people can&amp;#39;t warn of the impending shitshow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rubes buy it at market price en-masse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seconds after the rubes have bought it, dump for massive profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rules state not to panic sell, this is to encourage the rubes not to think it&amp;#39;s a scam and hold on as their BTC turns into a completely worthless shitcoin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it. The deception, the con and the art.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a warning to you. I lost a trivial amount of money, I was curious more than I was greedy. But I am talking to people who have lost nearly 4 figures worth of Fiat. If any of this looks obvious, well in a way it is, but scams are always obvious when someone is explaining them to you. On the face of it, I think I believed because I experienced the absolutely wild ride of FUN yesterday which was entirely coincidental - I just happened to hold a coin that PnD groups happened to pump and I got the benefit of it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay safe out there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE TIME BIG UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was added to the Discord channel:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear members, the pump was insane, we have 4 years of experience and never expected this volume. With a peak of 1200% this was the highest pump we have seen with this group. Was it the best pump? Not really. &lt;strong&gt;There is a lot of people that profited but because it went this high this quick, there is also people that lost during the pump. Luckily, there were a couple of waves the first few minutes.&lt;/strong&gt; The second minute there was a lot of selling volume, which means a lot of people in our group were able to sell. Like we always say, do NOT buy too high. If you are late buying in, do not buy in or wait for the second wave. Never buy above 500%. We will send video&amp;#39;s of people that participated soon. We will analyse this pump in a few hours. Chats will open later.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bolded emphasis mine. I think it&amp;#39;s complete fucking baloney. There was no wave, it was one spike which lasted a few seconds, and then massive selling pressure. More a dump than a pump.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone else in the server lodged a complaint and got this back:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That is unfortunate to hear. I&amp;#39;ve been getting DMs of people complaining. I have also seen someone lose their life savings today. We hope this VIP opportunity can help losers become winners next week guaranteed, and if you&amp;#39;re a winner to keep on winning. :slight_smile:&lt;br/&gt;
0.005 BTC is the price for next weeks signal.&lt;br/&gt;
You&amp;#39;ll be added to a private channel with other members.&amp;quot;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So not satisfied with ripping off thousands of users at once, now pay them to be added to a private group. What a load of bollocks.&lt;/p&gt;

I do part time jobs here and there as I can but it&amp;#39;s not sustainable between MH and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a teenager who I have been saving for since I don&amp;#39;t want him to start out like I did, having to enlist because of no other opportunities, so between trying to stretch necessities and taking care of him there hasn&amp;#39;t been much left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discovered BTC several years ago. Bought and stupidly sold at a loss. Got back in the game in early 2019 and have been stacking sats since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feels like this is a rare opportunity to rise above my lot in life so to speak and I think because of that I worry that maybe it&amp;#39;s all some kind of pyramid scheme because.. seriously can the powers that be really let this happen? I can&amp;#39;t contribute to society much anymore so I&amp;#39;m supposed to always be on the bottom rung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that mindset is what made me sell years ago and I worry I&amp;#39;ll psych myself out and do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone else feel it&amp;#39;s too good to be true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because I&amp;#39;ve been DCAing here and there its not anything I haven&amp;#39;t already mentally written off or will completely collapse if BTC does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just doesn&amp;#39;t feel like something people like me can accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq (proxy of the development of internet-based companies) in 1990s-2010s and the price of Bitcoin in 2016–2020 look almost identical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4epl1y2ag0961.png?width=918&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c170f8badfe3f7e2626ab98e19d8034510194d60&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/4epl1y2ag0961.png?width=918&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c170f8badfe3f7e2626ab98e19d8034510194d60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big tech companies, such as Amazon and Google weren’t always the titans they are today. First there was a nascent technology with limited adoption, then some market excitement, and before the final boom, a massive crash. Bitcoin saw its massive crash in 2017, it’s time for its final boom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While correlation isn’t causation, Bitcoin and the internet are not two completely different things. They are among the most disruptive technologies we&amp;#39;ve seen in the last 100 years or so. So looking at similarities is an invitation to reflect and think on what we may be overlooking.&lt;/p&gt;
