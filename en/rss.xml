In fact, you shouldn&amp;#39;t comment on someone&amp;#39;s eating habits in public AT ALL. You have no idea what their health is like, what it feels like to be them, what their physical limitations are, or what their relationship with food is like. You could be publically humaliting someone in regards to their disease and not even know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That person who you think is being disrespectful or wasteful at the dinner table may well be very upset at themselves because they can&amp;#39;t finish their meal because of an incredibly tragic mental illness that has changed the size of their stomach and appetite forever, and now someone is upset at them for &amp;quot;not clearing their plate.&amp;quot; Or now the waitress is pointing out to everyone, &amp;quot;You barely touched your meal!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that person has to repeat the same things over again, having to conceal these very private, sometimes undetectable by even the most closest people in their lives, illnesses: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not feeling well is all&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I ate before, I&amp;#39;m just not hungry&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I want to save it for later&amp;quot;, because blurting out &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t finish this meal due to my shrunken stomach because of (incredibly sad disease)&amp;quot; is a huge moodkiller during brunch and drinks with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish we would change the dialogue around the dinner table when it comes to people who cannot finish their meal. I wish people would stop pressuring people to eat more or less or this or that. Inevitably the least that could happen is you make that person uncomfortable and embarrassed about their illness in front of everyone, and the worst that could happen is that they become so distraught from the public humiliation, being reminded of the physical consequences of their disease at a time that should feel safe in inclusive, they cry once they&amp;#39;re alone, breakdown, relapse, self-harm, or plan to not eat for a whole day before they ever come to your house again to eat hoping they can finish whatever random amount of food you give them- just so they can prevent that horrible experience from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want people to eat more? Stop telling them they should. You might think you know someone, but many people with eating disorders conceal it so well that they go undetected by even their family members they live under the same roof with, or the person the wake up next to every morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating disorders are the most deadly psychological disease and pose many health issues that you can&amp;#39;t tell by just looking that they have: nausea, heartburn, shrunken stomach, stomachs that need assistance disgesting, IBS, constipation, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, complete loss of appetite (even when a recovered individual WANTS to eat more and gain weight).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People really don&amp;#39;t realize this because there&amp;#39;s not enough awareness, I don&amp;#39;t think people who comment on how little soneone eats are bad people- they usually come from a caring place, but are inadvertently causing harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most deadly psychiatric disease: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/eating-disorders/anorexia-nervosa/news/20110711/deadliest-psychiatric-disorder-anorexia&quot;&gt;https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/eating-disorders/anorexia-nervosa/news/20110711/deadliest-psychiatric-disorder-anorexia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permanent appetite loss in recovered individuals, anorexia not driven by the desire to lose weight, but by a lack of appetite due to illness or issues with the brain: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/digestive-disorders/symptoms-of-digestive-disorders/loss-of-appetite&quot;&gt;https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/digestive-disorders/symptoms-of-digestive-disorders/loss-of-appetite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very common in the Indian subcontinent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: About time I made an edit to have my final say and leave. I personally love English and it&amp;#39;s not even my mother tongue. It is, for me, the most beautiful language ever and I want to be as good at it as I can. I made this post because a lot of non-native speakers out there are &lt;em&gt;ridiculed&lt;/em&gt; everyday for bad, incorrect English. While it is important to speak the language you&amp;#39;re speaking as correctly as possible, for some it may not matter so much because they don&amp;#39;t need it anywhere in their life. Also, one should always look for when is one helpfully correcting your mistakes so you may learn and appreciate them. Enough preaching. Over and out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snow on the rear windshield limits your ability to see behind you, even if you have side rear view mirrors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snow on the TOP of your car can either fly off your car onto the car behind you, OR slightly melt from the interior heat of your car enough to slide onto your front windshield if you have to stop suddenly. In my experience this is one area of a car that I commonly see has not been cleared before driving. If you have a tall vehicle, get a telescoping snow brush and/or a small folding step stool to keep in the vehicle for these occasions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be safe out there!&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s why that’s not always the case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who suffered from trauma (specifically childhood trauma) are often attracted to people similar to the ones they grew up with. Your brain doesn’t care if it’s healthy or unhealthy—your brain cares that it’s familiar. In the same way that you may need to be careful of the partner you choose, be careful of your work environment, friends, and social community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain environments attract a certain type of individual, all who might be similarly distasteful or toxic to you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better quote would be “before you diagnose yourself with low self esteem, be sure you are not, in fact, surrounded by assholes”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in fact quite possible to be surrounded with toxic people (or at least people you don’t mesh with/people who don’t understand or appreciate you), without being an asshole yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
