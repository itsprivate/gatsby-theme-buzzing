&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s NextEra Energy? Summarized from Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is the largest electric utility in the USA by market capitalization. (At 160B currently)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenues of over $19.20 billion in 2019. Operating income of $5.35 billion in 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 14,000 employees throughout the US and Canada.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The important subsidiaries include

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Utilities;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Florida Power &amp;amp; Light (FPL) - A Florida electric utility. Notable for having wider profit margins than usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gulf Power Company - Electric utility in the Alabama area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NextEra Energy Capital Holdings (NEECH)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NextEra  Energy Resources (NEER) - The largest operators of wind and solar  projects in the world. Importantly, expansive holdings in the Midwest.  Also has numerous energy storage projects under their belt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They also have a 35% stake in NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) with Jim Robo being the CEO of both companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/fixed-income-investors/financial-policy&quot;&gt;In  fact, I&amp;#39;ll just direct you to NextEra&amp;#39;s IR page, because for some  reason they&amp;#39;ve placed a very solid series of pages outlining their  financial health where almost nobody will find them.&lt;/a&gt; You can flip  through the Policy, Strength, Funding/Capital Structure, Cash  Flow/Leverage, and Liquidity pages there at your leisure to understand  more about the company. But basically, they&amp;#39;re extremely healthy as a  company. Notably, they&amp;#39;ve been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/11-02-2020-222338600&quot;&gt;unwinding positions for cash&lt;/a&gt; recently despite their solid balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now,  I&amp;#39;d like to point out their P/E: 41. Yup, this is a &amp;quot;boring&amp;quot; utility company trading at 41x P/E after running up 200% in 5 years and 80% in  2. For reference, Microsoft is trading at 34.90 P/E. As far as utilities  go, I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say these guys are as far from boring as it  gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary of the fundamentals;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management is extremely reliable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&amp;#39;re the market leader in renewables deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&amp;#39;ve proven they know how to compete and edge out profits in cutthroat industries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High P/E, but in a stable industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have plenty of leverage available for massive capital expenditures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now  onto why I think they will collect more than their fair share of  Biden&amp;#39;s upcoming stimulus. Let&amp;#39;s start off by looking at what Biden has  been pushing in his announcements;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing the environmental costs onto polluters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing renewables directly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating long-term middle class union jobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among utilities, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/12-11-2020-173514490&quot;&gt;NextEra stands out as an early and consistent investor in renewables&lt;/a&gt;. Straight from the link above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According  to S&amp;amp;P Global Trucost, NextEra Energy ranked ahead of its peers on a  number of impressive reported performance metrics, among others,  including signed contracts to build approximately 12,000 megawatts of  additional wind, solar and battery storage projects as of the close of  2019, and NextEra Energy&amp;#39;s announced target of emissions reductions per  unit of generation by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline, equivalent, to a  40% reduction in absolute emissions – and this, despite an expected  doubling of generation over the period. Already, NextEra Energy reports  more than 50% of its generation is from zero- and near-zero-emitting  sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say that point 1 will hurt them much less than it will their less progressive competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally,  as a result of their investments so far, they&amp;#39;re not untested when it  comes to deployment: They know what to expect and we know they can  execute on larger CapEx programs with less risk than the competition. If  Biden is to throw the expected 40 billion a year into the industry,  it&amp;#39;s quite likely NextEra will be ready to scale up operations  sustainably and successfully to capitalize on the opportunity, clearing  point two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But point three is the  really interesting one. Let me start off with a question; If you were a  democratic president that wanted to create middle-class jobs in  renewables, how would you go about it? Would you invest in the companies  making the end product? Maybe a little for the companies that pull the  required resources out of the ground too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/khx7eb/stimulus_bill_includes_35_billion_for_clean/&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#39;s  take a look at what the clean energy portion stimulus bill a few weeks  ago contained and see how NextEra is positioned for each portion.&lt;/a&gt; Big thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/u/millerlit/&quot;&gt;/u/millerlit&lt;/a&gt; for summarizing. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/reports-and-filings/annual-reports&quot;&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be referencing the NextEra 2019 annual report from this point on&lt;/a&gt;. Please bring up a copy if you&amp;#39;d like to verify the numbers I claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1.5 Billion for Solar - Will probably go to most industry players pretty  equally, NextEra will get a cut as a result of their investing through NEER. 12% of NEER&amp;#39;s generation is from solar power according to the 2019 annual report (p.13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$2.6 Billion for Transport - NextEra probably won&amp;#39;t get much of this, but they have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/12-08-2020-123104618&quot;&gt;made an acquisition&lt;/a&gt; in the field within the last month. It would be a nice perk if they  announced major projects here, but let&amp;#39;s just leave this as a  hypothetical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1.7 billion for a Weatherization Assistance Program - I&amp;#39;m not 100% sure how  they&amp;#39;ll break this down, but up here in Canada they do these programs  as rebates through utility providers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fpl.com/save/programs.html&quot;&gt;NextEra is almost definitely going to get a cut of this as far as I can see.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1.08 billion for short-term, long-term, seasonal and transportation energy  storage technologies - NextEra is pretty big in the battery storage  field. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/nextera-energy-to-spend-1b-on-energy-storage-projects-in-2021&quot;&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ll be the ones developing a new battery chemistry, but they&amp;#39;re definitely a serious user.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$2.36 billion for smart utility and energy distribution technologies. -  They&amp;#39;re going to get a serious cut of this for obvious reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$625  million for new research, development and commercialization for both  onshore and offshore wind technologies - 65% of NEER&amp;#39;s renewables  generation is wind power according to the 2019 annual report. They&amp;#39;re  going to get a nice cut here too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$850 million for geothermal technology development - Nothing here will go to NextEra, as far as I&amp;#39;m aware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1093 million for marine energy and hydropower tech - Nothing here will go to NextEra, as far as I&amp;#39;m aware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$500 million pot for industry and transportation looking to decarbonize - 0 stake in this race&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$6.2  billion for carbon capture utilization and storage technologies - FPL  is investing quite heavily here, as 74% of their generation back in 2019  was from Natural Gas (p.9). They&amp;#39;re going to get a good portion of  this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$6.6  billion in funding for the modernization of existing nuclear power  plants and the development of advanced reactors - FPL generated 22% of  their power from Nuclear in 2019 (p.9). They&amp;#39;re probably going to get a  fair slice of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$4.7 billion for fusion industry - NextEra isn&amp;#39;t spending money on fusion development, as far as I&amp;#39;m aware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looser  regulations for using government land for renewables - A nice gesture  to drop land costs by increasing supply for sustainable uses. &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/US_federal_land.agencies.svg/1280px-US_federal_land.agencies.svg.png&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a map of US public land so you can take a look.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you get the point by now - NextEra has a slice in a lot of these pies directly. On top of that, the renewables segment as a whole is going to hugely benefit from the stimulus driving down the capital expenditures required for panels and turbines. Frankly, there are very few people  better positioned than a well-run utility company with massive credit  available taking on the debt at great rates. When I put it like that, it&amp;#39;s no surprise that these folks managed to thrive under Trump&amp;#39;s policies - and that they&amp;#39;re extremely well positioned to grow aggressively under Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s even a fun political trap for the republicans here. Do you know  where the best place to place on-shore wind turbines is? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/images/itl/sed/gsg/mri50_2mph_inc_gumbel_v2.png&quot;&gt;The midwest&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/maps-non-hurricane-non-tornadic-extreme-wind-speeds-contiguous-united-states&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;) - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;amp;q=US+2020+election+results&quot;&gt;A notable republican stronghold area&lt;/a&gt;. NEER&amp;#39;s own wind turbine deployment map in the annual report (p.13) backs up that their expansion is largely in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised at all if the Democrats quietly slated a lot of  the renewables spending into the midwest in an attempt to entrench a pro-union and pro-clean energy vote there - forcing the republican platform into a weird spot in future elections. It helps that that&amp;#39;s pretty much the economical way to play it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, I think NextEra&amp;#39;s going to be a serious beneficiary of the renewables bill however it ends up going down, even if only because of their financial resources, deployment experience, and contracts with  suppliers. A big portion of this is that I don&amp;#39;t believe the market has  priced in the amount they&amp;#39;re collecting directly and indirectly because  the response so far seems to have been &amp;quot;FAN/TAN/ICLN/QCLN goes brrrrr&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about the competition; The other US utility companies that were  listed as leaders in the clean energy transition by Global Platts are  Dominion Energy, Sempra Energy, and Xcel Energy. From one look at them  it seems like they&amp;#39;re (1) much smaller and (2) at best half off on P/E  so I didn&amp;#39;t really look at them too hard if I&amp;#39;m being honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the bigger question; Do I grab NEE or [clean energy ETF of choice]?  Really, it&amp;#39;s up to you. I think that the clean energy ETFs are trading  at downright idiotic valuations now. That, and I&amp;#39;d much rather bet on  one or two known strong performers that I believe in than I would on a  bunch of companies picked by someone else. That being said, those ETFs  have much more hype behind them, which is an important consideration in  this market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short-term catalysts  are basically the stimulus bill and earnings on the 26th. I expect some  big announcements on how they plan to capitalize on the bill during the  earnings call, and a huge bump in interest if they announce that they&amp;#39;re  accelerating their renewables pipeline and focusing on that portion of  the company more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, onto positions and how I&amp;#39;d trade it;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If  you just want to buy and hold in an account for the extreme long-term  -&amp;gt; buy shares and hold, I think this is going to heavily outperform  the S&amp;amp;P 500 into the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If  you want to get some of the spicy synthetic leverage gains with me  -&amp;gt; Jan 20 2023 80c&amp;#39;s. They print if the stock goes up ~15% in the  next 2 years because IV is super low. I grabbed 10 at 12.10 at the start  of the week on the dip, but I think they&amp;#39;ll open 13.00+ tomorrow. Keep  in mind that you don&amp;#39;t need to hold till expiry, I&amp;#39;ll probably liquidate  these after a year because I want the tax benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all from me today! This is my first DD post ever, so if you&amp;#39;ve got any suggestions/questions feel free to fire away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another day, another EV play. TSLA and NIO are both examples of EV companies that have capitalized on the gains resulting from being early to the party for electric cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awesome. But there is a whole other dimension to the automobile industry other than cars that HAS NOT been electrified yet, and that this company has a first-mover advantage on (just like NIO and TSLA did): &lt;strong&gt;The medium-heavy duty vehicles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I present you with an opportunity to be early to this party featuring the sleeping giant that is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;LION ELECTRIC ($NGA)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is currently trading under the SPAC ticker $NGA with a merger completion set for the end of Q1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s right, by buying 1 share of $NGA right now, you are effectively buying 1 share of Lion Electric. For anyone who wants to better understand SPACs, I highly recommend a quick search on Investopedia.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this post by saying that &lt;a href=&quot;https://thelionelectric.com/en&quot;&gt;Lion Electric&lt;/a&gt; has been working on their vehicles, battery technology, and charging grids since 2010 and ALREADY HAS VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. So no, they are not some shambolic ponzi scheme of an EV company (looking at you NKLA). In fact, it literally has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/largest-zero-emission-school-bus-fleet-in-north-america-bolstered-by-10-bus-delivery-from-lion-electric-301194935.html#:%7E:text=The%20Lion%20Electric%20Co.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;text=With%20these%20new%20buses%2C%20Twin,school%20buses%20in%20its%20fleet.&quot;&gt;largest fleet of electified school buses&lt;/a&gt; on the road in North America as we speak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.thelionelectric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investor-Presentation_20203011.pdf&quot;&gt;Here is the link to their investor presentation where they are already forecasting a positive EBITDA by the end of 2021. Highly recommend skimming over it, but I will highlight the main points later on in the post for yall anyways.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;So why haven&amp;#39;t I heard about this &amp;quot;Lion Electric&amp;quot; company?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple answer: it&amp;#39;s a Canadian company located in Quebec. No company outside of America or China can be of interest right? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RIGHT????&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Well, the EV credits and subsidies in Quebec are great, but other than that you are right. The good thing is that it ain&amp;#39;t gonna be Canadian-based much longer. Lion is going to reveal its new U.S. manufacturing facility any day now, rumored to be in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-lion-electric-co-to-deliver-michigans-first-11-electric-school-buses-as-part-of-the-volkswagen-mitigation-settlement-300917333.html&quot;&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; where it delivered the state&amp;#39;s first ever 100% electric school buses. Lion Electric, in fact, are already &lt;a href=&quot;https://michigan-company.com/co/the-lion-electric-co-usa-inc&quot;&gt;registered as a business&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan. Oh, and it just so happens that the rumored factory location is right in between two Amazon factories, and is not a mere coincidence (see more below on why this is pertinent). Anyhow, their future clearly lies in the United States, and they are uplisting as LEV on the NYSE when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005149/en/Northern-Genesis-Acquisition-Corp.-Announces-Filing-by-The-Lion-Electric-Company-of-a-Preliminary-Registration-Statement-on-SEC-Form-F-4-in-Connection-With-Their-Proposed-Business-Combination&quot;&gt;merger&lt;/a&gt; with NGA closes in March, as per the CEO. Seriously, look at how many job listings are posted across America by Lion Electric by clicking &lt;a href=&quot;https://emploislion.com/en/jobs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, why should I care?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because Jeff Bezos and Joe Biden care.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News silently broke last week that &lt;strong&gt;AMAZON&lt;/strong&gt; has come to an agreement to purchase up to 500 of Lions class-6 and class-8 delivery trucks per year from 2021-2025 (or up to 2500 over 5 years). Emphasis on &amp;#39;silently&amp;#39; because this company, unlike many, lets their results do the talking rather than a slimy PR team. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that Amazon has the option to purchase at least &lt;strong&gt;2500 trucks per year (conservative number), or 1.1b worth&lt;/strong&gt; for the five years following 2025, with a possibility of acquiring up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stnonline.com/news/school-bus-production-to-benefit-from-amazon-agreement-lion-electric/&quot;&gt;15.8% of the company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yup. Amazon are in bed with Lion Electric, and you should be too.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, before anyone asks, the Tesla semi-truck serves entirely different purposes. No point in comparing apples to oranges. Tesla&amp;#39;s truck is specialized for a single purpose: long distance delivery from warehouse to retail. &lt;strong&gt;The Lion-8 and Lion-6 delivery trucks are much more versatile, will be used by Amazon to deliver between Amazon&amp;#39;s facilities, and most importantly they are ready for MASS SCALE PRODUCTION&lt;/strong&gt;. So, no, they are not competing against the Tesla semi and will fill different voids in the market. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/nJiXzp8&quot;&gt;See here how diversified their truck lineup really is.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;And what about Joe Biden?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleepy Joe and his Clean Energy Plan have vowed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/11/14/what-bidens-environmental-plans-mean-for-electric-vehicles-syndication/&quot;&gt;electrify 500,000 school buses&lt;/a&gt; over the next 4 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NO COMPANY better positioned to take a huge piece of that pie than Lion Electric. If that seems like a stretch to you, consider this: the CEO of Lion, Marc Bedard, will be speaking at a virtual event on the future of E-mobility this Wednesday (Jan 13), &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.demio.com/ref/vFksZ11nZGvHsaxG&quot;&gt;where the Co-chair of Biden&amp;#39;s Infrastructure Committee will be in attendance&lt;/a&gt;. Their client from Twin Rivers Unified School District went as far as labelling Lion&amp;#39;s electric buses as the &lt;strong&gt;[Rolls Royce and Tesla of school buses]&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StpnGrItO4E&amp;amp;t=45s&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StpnGrItO4E&amp;amp;t=45s&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure many of you will be aware of the merger completed today with Proterra, another electric bus manufacturer. Awesome right? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820630/000121390021001584/ea133141ex99-2_arclight.htm?fbclid=IwAR0X17En3iZX-fZhuNAneJG2lDvOX_pT-OcKlXVbKWmnAMFtuNbUsrqA4M0&quot;&gt;A real shame that, in their investors presentation, they did not compare their revenue projections to Lion&amp;#39;s past the year 2021, as they would&amp;#39;ve admitted to being second best.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proterra are also exclusively a bus play, while Lion expects nearly 90% of its revenue by 2024 to be from trucks. In fact, Lion&amp;#39;s revenue from their trucks ALONE in 2024 is projected to trump Proterra&amp;#39;s entire revenue in 2025.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, none of these companies have anywhere near the capacity to electrify 25% of the American school bus fleet by themselves in 4 years. So I assure you that Lion will be providing buses to Biden over the next 4 years, as will Proterra probably, since there are only 3 players that are READY in the industry to be in on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why should I be buying NOW?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because today may very well be the last chance to get in $NGA under 30$.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Cramer is inviting Marc (the CEO) onto &lt;strong&gt;Mad Money&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/ucl54g5avaa61.jpg&quot;&gt;TODAY most likely&lt;/a&gt; after it was initially scheduled last week, but the events in Washington forced a postponement. A blessing in disguise for everyone really, and a final chance to get in before this it takes off. NGA is still trading at a measly 1B valuation, with Amazon ALONE forecasted to purchase more than 1b worth of trucks per year come 2025. Marc is going to pump Lion to the best of abilities on Mad Money, and Cramer is going to eat all of it up, as this company is the real deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I know $NGA will get pumped so hard?&lt;/strong&gt; The CEO of Lion featured on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fm93.com/audio/361623/marc-bedard-pdg-de-lion-amazon-dispose-a-acheter-des-camions-du-producteur-quebecois?fbclid=IwAR1N4Kr0eX-nLjr2-VThUCUVcGIwRlL0ZpC7Abpic7fQY7In4BbJqz7Y7jE&quot;&gt;local news podcast&lt;/a&gt; last week and boasted about the Amazon deal as well as their advantage over competition in electrifying buses and trucks, &lt;strong&gt;comparing Lion to Tesla in the process&lt;/strong&gt;. Unfortunately, he said all of this in French, which I&amp;#39;m sure quite a few of you won&amp;#39;t understand. But once he regurgitates it all in English to Jim Cramer, the significant deal with Amazon and its similarities to Tesla in its infancy will wreak havoc in the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh yeah, and, by the way, the last time Cramer hosted a CEO from an up and coming EV merger acquisition (CIIC), that stock went from 21$-37$ in the two following trading sessions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;But why should I pick Lion Electric over all the other EV stocks that get spammed in here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because Lion Electric offers much more than just prototypes, ideas, and false hopes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· There are currently 7 different &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/L1cu6oS&quot;&gt;trucks and buses&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;available for purchase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· They already have &lt;strong&gt;300+ vehicles on the road&lt;/strong&gt; today with over 
  6mil miles between them &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Multi-year deal agreement for &lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt; to purchase up to 
  2500 vehicles (Lion6 and Lion8) 2021-2025, with even bigger 
  and more lucrative opportunities afterwards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· &lt;strong&gt;CN (huge Canadian transporter)&lt;/strong&gt; recently Purchased 50 
  trucks - with a chance to increase size of order later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· &lt;strong&gt;Government-backed&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/xoJ9Kze&quot;&gt;Canada&amp;#39;s prime minister Justin 
  Trudeau supports the company&lt;/a&gt;, 
  while nationalized companies like Hydro Quebec and SAQ have 
  purchase agreements in place that provide a strong foundation 
  for Lion&amp;#39;s business&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· &lt;strong&gt;Produce their own batteries:&lt;/strong&gt; on top of already having suppliers for their batteries, Lion is 
  building a facility to and immunize themselves against potential shortages as they upscale 
  production, set to be completed in 2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· &lt;strong&gt;V2G technology&lt;/strong&gt; ready for the batteries, and implemented 
  into their school buses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Deals with &lt;strong&gt;BMW, ChargePoint, Nuvve, and Romeo Power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/dFFTczt&quot;&gt;8 NEW vehicles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to be produced between 2021-2022 
  including: Ambulance, bucket truck, Class 5 and Class 7 trucks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/wFbrle5&quot;&gt;USA expansion&lt;/a&gt; completed by 
  2022, will give them a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Made in America&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; image&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· NKLA &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; had to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/23/tech/nikola-garbage-truck-%20%0A%20%20canceled/index.html&quot;&gt;scrap their deal on the table with Republic Services&lt;/a&gt; to 
  provide them with up to &lt;strong&gt;5000 garbage disposal trucks&lt;/strong&gt; just a 
  few weeks ago. Who could possibly fill the void and has a ZERO EMISSION
  refuse truck ready for purchase? Lion Electric, that&amp;#39;s 
  who. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsNQwjXDP4&quot;&gt;See the truck in action here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;How about their financials??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/uLp1pf3&quot;&gt;Well, here are their financials and revenue projections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Projected revenue of &lt;strong&gt;3.6 billion $&lt;/strong&gt; by 2024&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· &lt;strong&gt;Cash flow positive&lt;/strong&gt; in 2023&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· &lt;strong&gt;EBITDA positive by end of 2021&lt;/strong&gt;, with EBITDA growth of 
  approximately 16% YOY afterwards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Cost reduction of 50% by 2024 &lt;strong&gt;(better profit margins)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undervalued EV company tied to Amazon that has product labelled as the &amp;quot;Tesla of school buses&amp;quot;. CEO will appear on Mad Money today most likely, and $NGA will fly past 30$. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POSITIONS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/L4gr51J&quot;&gt;Here.&lt;/a&gt; 700 $NGA shares and 1k warrants, with an extra 500 shares in a separate account. Would not recommend options on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Office of Defects Investigation unit of the agency determined that the failure of the media control unit is a safety issue since functions like the backup camera and defogging and defrosting setting controls stop working as well as audible chimes, which are used when the turn signal indicator is activated and to alert drivers while the vehicle&amp;#39;s Autopilot advanced driver assistance system is engaged. Reports of the MCUs suddenly failing have been a topic for years in Tesla forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The failure is caused when the memory storage in a flash drive used in the used in these vehicles reaches capacity, investigators concluded. The only solution is to replace the physical piece of hardware. Vehicles affected include Model S sedans built between 2012 and 2018 as well as Model X SUVs in 2016 through 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company did provide information to NHTSA, which is contained in the report. Tesla confirmed to NHTSA that all units will inevitably fail given the memory device’s finite storage capacity. Tesla provided its own statistical model showing the number of projected weekly MCU repairs from 2020 to 2028. The automaker estimated that replacement rates for MCU failures will peak in early 2022 and gradually decline until (near) full part turnover has been accomplished in 2028, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These vehicles are equipped with an NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor with an integrated 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device. Part of this 8GB storage capacity is used each time the vehicle is started. The eMMC NAND cell hardware fails when the storage capacity is reached, resulting in failure of the MCU, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eMMC NAND flash device&amp;#39;s lifespan based upon the number of program/erase cycles, after which the MCU fails due to memory wear-out. Investigators determined that the expected usage life rating for the 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device is about 3,000 Program-Erase cycles, after which the eMMC NAND flash memory device would become fully consumed and no longer be operational. At a daily cycle usage rate of 1.4 per block, accumulation of 3,000 P/E cycles would take only 5 to 6 years, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency has officially requested that Tesla initiate a recall to notify all owners, purchasers, and dealers of the subject vehicles of this safety defect and provide a remedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By them saying that is actually meaning that they do see these target price as realistic (kinda mean they won&amp;#39;t screw it again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to remind you, BABA group is making a LOT of money over and is completely profitable, the only thing made their stock go down from 3XX to their current value is the issue with the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, after a bit more DD, here is what I can say for KTOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First i&amp;#39;ll repeat what the other post said. Recently ARK, Blackrock, Vanguard and Fidelity have bought a huge number of shares in KTOS, and there is a good reason why. I&amp;#39;ll link to the original post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kvrv7b/cathie_arkbacked_tech_innovator_kratos_defense/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as it will likely be a more interesting read and im not great at formatting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought i&amp;#39;d look into them and I was pretty pleased with what I saw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended the presentation, and this is what I managed to jot down during the presentation. I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;ll look very boring, but maybe for you its worth reading. I was taking these down as I was listening, so there may be gaps or misquoted information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant invests and won a lot of contracts. Continued investment in 2021 and accelerate in 2022 as these mature to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary Areas&lt;/strong&gt; - Target drones – very high in demand. Lots of contacts are for target drones. Leading high-performance jet target drones. Drones get shot down and then replaced, looking to expand domestically and internationally as new drone requirements are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Skyborg contract awarded. LCAAT contract awarded, government announced the Valkyrie flew with the F22 and F35 showing they have drones performing missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next gen engines for drones and cruise missiles – important announcement made to have another contract for Kratos next gen engine for cruise missiles and drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unmanned drones&lt;/strong&gt; – Gremlin is reusable, only company with a family of these drones (low cost, 400k to 3m). Force multiplies and they’re the market leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Gremlin – govt announced they have multiple customers for the gremlin drones for when it transitions from research team at DARPA. Likely moved to 2022/2023 due to covid and earthquake. Nothing else in the Gremlin, Valkyrie class line aside from Kratos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space and satellite communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Biggest business in kratos, leading the industry, supporting ~80% space missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Thousands of LEO and MEO satellites planned including HBTSS () and TITAN (Tactical Interface Tracking Application Node) program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Microsoft partnered with musk and starlink, AND kratos. Large, new 5G GSaaS beginning. Very low latency and very integral to this. Doing military and commercial, leveraging scale of having both military and commercial, making them competitive as they drive costs down. Very high expectations. High profitability 2022/2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microwave electronics&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Largest independent microwave companies internationally, in support of C5ISR programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Industry seeing increased funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Kratos typically only provider&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic deterrence&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o GBSD 
 180m contract including significant development systems needed for customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; New facility with new equipment for this program, production multiple times larger than dev piece, so expect massive investment. 2nd half of 2021, big step up in revenue in 2022. Big growth driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turbine tech and engines&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Designed into a number of systems, only 2 publicly disclosed (Graywolf and speed racer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Recently can announce additional funding at low cost cruise missiles and tactical drones. The engine is the largest bill (35%). Want to disrupt the engine market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Number of agencies looking to fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missile defense and hypersonic programs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o One of 2 primary providers for ballistic missile defenses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Key supporter of the AEGIS programs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial information&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Drone opportunity expected to transform company soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Space and satellite sector very well positioned and expecting lots of growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Won a number of classified contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o 2021 will be last year of increased internal investments. Heavy investment, but lots of growth after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Ground based strategic deterrent – multi hundred million contract, significant expenditure on machinery, tools and equipment. In 2021, as they won the contract in 2020, it’ll be a significant CapEx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Lots of IP movements on engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o Not taking govt funding for the next gen engines, they’ll eat the costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Will need secure facility with classified environment. Most employees have very high security clearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o 2021 solid growth year, no questions about it. Primary dial on how good this will be is going to be a recompete. If not successful in the recompete, it’s a 35m hole to fill. VERY strong if they get it. If not, the growth won’t be as strong due to this hole. 2022 and 2023 look like step function growth years with lots of contracts maturing to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o LEO constellations from SpaceX will benefit Kratos. CEO isn’t sure about STARSHIP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o 70% federal/DoD contracts vs 30% private contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;price increase over 60% in Uranium since 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ll open up a position and see how it plays out for the next few weeks. Thursday Biden&amp;#39;s trillion dollar plan will be revealed I guess, so everyone is expecting a boost in clean energy related stocks.

For those of you who paper handed, I’m sorry. Although maybe it opened your eyes to realize that WSB runs the market. We’re bigger than investment firms, hence why there’s still a play to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLTR. Yet to explode, yet held on by all the same diamond hands of $GME. There’s a presentation at the end of this month for Palantir and it’s for showcasing their technology so shareholders and people who haven’t gotten in yet can better understand the product they’re providing. Although you don’t want to get in after the presentation, you need to get in before. If you think that $GME is exploding, just wait because $PLTR is known by everyone. I’ve even heard random idiots at bars talking about it. The amount of diamond 💎 hands 🖐 in PLTR is catastrophic, there’s no doubt that this company will succeed in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lockup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lockup period is coming to an end, and shareholders will be selling of their stakes. It’s inevitable, but that’s why you make a play on PLTR now because the drive up before lockup will be something extraordinary since shareholders will try to maximize their gains upon lockup ending. Take those GME tendies and put them straight back into the market with good ol’ Palantir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make some money now, sell before lockup and screw over the shareholders by forcing them to hold their shares once again. The amount of volume upon lockup ending will be tremendous and quite possibly the biggest shit show of 2021. I’m in for the ride and hope you guys are too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Presentation end of month = Drive up in stock price. Lockup in early February = Drive up for shareholders to capitalize their gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positions: 400 Shares @ 26.4, 1/15 27c , 1/22 28c&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like big tech players are now considering EVs as the next step to grow their market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like Tesla will have a lot of competition in the EV marketspace in the future, but with the lead that they have now, will have be able to solidify their spot in the EV space before other big tech players enter the space? What are your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Nvidia said it would launch an even more inexpensive desktop graphics card, the RTX 3060 — without the “Ti” designation — for $329, in addition to the new laptops. Nvidia said that more than 70 laptop manufacturers would offer gaming laptops that use the company’s next-generation Ampere architecture. Nvidia said its new gaming laptops would be priced at $999 for the RTX 3060 model, $1,299 for the RTX 3070 model, and $1,999 for the RTX 3080 model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many gamers found this past holiday season, however, those list prices were pretty much meaningless as resellers scooped up available RTX 30-series cards and sold them at much higher prices, and remaining 30-series cards were only available from manufacturers who were bundling the cards into pre-made gaming rigs. Supply problems were so bad, especially as many new games that required fast hardware were released, that even Nvidia’s older 20-series generation of cards saw significant markups from resellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new product launch, however, should be a little easier given that laptop chips make better use of constrained foundry resources, Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, told MarketWatch in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

We soon came to realize that most of our work was completely the same as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cathiesark.com&quot;&gt;www.cathiesark.com&lt;/a&gt; , but we have since then added the change in amount of shares YTD, in each individual stock. This is to get an overview of what stocks are being added continuosly, so we can spot some of the opportunities that Cathie Wood and her team are seeing in the market, and which they no longer see (example: slowly selling out of EXONE CO/THE for several days). The changes in amount of shares are gathered from the email subscription from ARK, which is then added to the sheet and compared to the amount of shares owned in the individual companies at 12/30/2020. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides these changed in positions, there are also added completely new companies in the ETF’s - you can see those in the sheet, with a comment “NEWLY ADDED” far right&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the information below is from the google sheets, link at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;TOP 5 INCREASED POSITIONS:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SAREPTA THERAPEUTICS +359.25% &lt;em&gt;(weight in ARKG now: 1.03%)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MAGNA INTERNATIONAL +228.67% &lt;em&gt;(weight in ARKQ now: 1.51%)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BAIDU INC +134.12% &lt;em&gt;(avg. weight now: 2.82%) (newly added to ARKW)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10X GENOMICS INC CLASS-A +117.97% &lt;em&gt;(avg. weight now: 0.78%) (newly added to ARKK)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS +68.93% &lt;em&gt;(avg. weight now: 1.97%) (newly added to ARKK)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;TOP 5 DECREASED POSITIONS:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FLIR SYSTEMS -69.22% &lt;em&gt;(weight in ARKQ now: 1.28%)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EXONE CO/THE -42.80% &lt;em&gt;(weight in ARKQ now: 0.72%) (recently removed from ARKK)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TESLA INC -16.16% &lt;em&gt;(avg. weight now: 10.44%)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR -13.51% &lt;em&gt;(avg. weight now: 1.76%)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPLUNK INC -11.13% &lt;em&gt;(avg. weight now: 0.86%)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The change in % is meant to represent the change in shares owned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Example: if there&amp;#39;s 1000 TSLA stocks owned, and another 1000 are added, then that&amp;#39;s a 100% increase.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“avg. weight” represents the average weight in the ETF’s that is holding the stock.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;All shares, from all the main five ETF&amp;#39;s, have been added in this comparison.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Link for sheet with data: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EEywCKauljHmqIqABdyyRdmRizqzGrACJOm9pzHjmXc/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EEywCKauljHmqIqABdyyRdmRizqzGrACJOm9pzHjmXc/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you mark the headers, you are able to rank the stocks by pressing the sort &amp;amp; filter button on PC and create a temporary filter. On phone, I think you have to mark the header and press the three dots, and then create a temporary filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT 1: Added explanation of “avg. weight”
EDIT 2: Added that there are newly added companies besides these changes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers awarded funding to expand Akebia drug trial&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UTHealth News says Researchers have received funding from the Department of Defense to expand the Phase II clinical trial of vadadustat, a drug being developed by Akebia that could help prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome in Covid-19 patients, at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, UTHealth News&amp;#39; Amy Laukka reports. The award was given through the DOD&amp;#39;s Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program as a COVID Clinical Trial Award, according to the report. Akebia recently completed its global Phase III clinical trial development for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease in patients on dialysis and not on dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;
