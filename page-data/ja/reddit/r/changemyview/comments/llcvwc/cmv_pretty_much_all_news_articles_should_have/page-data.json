For example, my Dad told me the stock market performed much better under Trump than Obama, but that&#39;s not really true - <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2481/stock-market-performance-by-president\">https://www.macrotrends.net/2481/stock-market-performance-by-president</a></p>\n\n<p>I absolutely love Andrew Yang&#39;s idea of a President using a powerpoint deck for the State of the Union address with relatively easy to understand time-series data. I&#39;ve run across <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/\">https://ourworldindata.org/</a> and feel like similar sources should be constantly referenced and included in news articles.</p>\n\n<p>I get that with complex situations, one has to sometimes interpret simple data in a sophisticated way and / or present some complex looking data, but that&#39;s where I feel like journalists should come in with relevant commentary. Linking to other articles with some relevant data / studies (which few people likely follow) is useful for citing info, but to really convey messages, I feel like presenting readers with more raw data would be immensely helpful.</p>\n\n<p>I understand most journalists are not data visualization people, so there might need to be a shift there and perhaps more non-proprietary data available, but I&#39;d prefer almost every article I read to include multiple charts, graphs, and other relevant data.</p>\n\n<p>Similar to how we use a topic sentence to convey what a paragraph is about, most paragraphs should start with data to drive home a point. The Economist does this somewhat well, but I&#39;d prefer it if news in general had 3-5 as much data to drive home points.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think? What am I missing? Is it too complex to do this? Is there space for a more data-visualization-focused periodical?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/llcvwc/cmv_pretty_much_all_news_articles_should_have/","title":"CMV: Pretty much all news articles should have more charts, infographics, and visualized data.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-17T01:34:01.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-17 01:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"fee60b26-76d3-5a74-8973-ac33d6c0516b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/llcvwc/cmv_pretty_much_all_news_articles_should_have/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/llcvwc/cmv_pretty_much_all_news_articles_should_have/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"gt456","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/gt456","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"gt456","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：几乎所有的新闻文章都应该有更多的图表、信息图和可视化的数据。","the_new_excerpt":"一般的新闻文章有时似乎会列出一大堆统计数字，依据是\n作家的研究和知识，这是伟大的，但我觉得看到更多的。\n可视化数据将使人们能够\n\n 1.变得更懂数据（我觉得一般人都缺乏）。\n 2.把眼前的问题理解为......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：幾乎所有的新聞文章都應該有更多的圖表、信息圖和可視化的數據。","the_new_excerpt":"一般的新聞文章有時似乎會列出一大堆統計數字，依據是\n作家的研究和知識，這是偉大的，但我覺得看到更多的。\n可視化數據將使人們能夠\n\n 1.變得更懂數據（我覺得一般人都缺乏）。\n 2.把眼前的問題理解爲......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-d9ba2b20-a28f-5f61-a177-eeabbaf539b1","excerpt":"I often see debates on YouTube where people argue about the logistics of\ntransgenderism and the transgender community.
