They probably have the votes in the house, the president will sign off on it, but it seems somewhat unlikely that it will get past the senate. I think you could make a reasonable argument that most of America wants this increase, after all the democrats hold a pretty big majority in the house, which is elected in proportion to population. Where it&#39;s failing is in the senate, which was in part created to prevent states with large populations from imposing their will on states with small populations.</p>\n\n<p>To me this seems like a case of everything working as intended. There&#39;s a policy that&#39;s widely supported but whose popularity depends quite heavily on what state you&#39;re looking at. The solution is to bypass the US senate and enact the policy in states whose voters elected representatives who actually want it. I counted nineteen states that have democratic majorities in both the house and senate, sixteen of which also have a democratic governor. None of these states have a $15 an hour minimum wage, which seems surprising given that their voters are largely responsible for electing the federal representatives who would make it a nationwide policy. Twenty three states have republican majorities in the house and senate, plus republican governors. They represent a minority of the population, but they clearly don&#39;t want this policy.</p>\n\n<p>To me the solution seems obvious. Stop trying to force the $15 an hour minimum wage on states that don&#39;t want it, and enact it in blue states right away. You&#39;ll cover most of the US population and the change will be concentrated in places that actually want it. Minimum wage by state or even by county seems like a better solution anyway because it can be indexed to the cost of living. You need a lot more to get by in NYC or Seattle than you do in a small town in Mississippi.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lw6204/cmv_us_democrats_should_push_for_a_higher_minimum/","title":"CMV: US Democrats should push for a higher minimum wage in blue states, not at the federal level","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-02T19:33:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-02 19:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"105f693e-22af-5957-a430-df3e59f7b5d4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lw6204/cmv_us_democrats_should_push_for_a_higher_minimum/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lw6204/cmv_us_democrats_should_push_for_a_higher_minimum/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"SharkSpider","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SharkSpider","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"SharkSpider","score":82,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：美国民主党人应该在蓝州推动提高最低工资，而不是在联邦层面。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，民主党人又一次推动了每小时15美元的联邦最低工资。他们\n可能有众议院的投票，总统将签署，但它\n似乎有点不太可能，它将得到通过参议院。我想你可以让\n一个合理的论点，大多数美国人都想这样... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：美國民主黨人應該在藍州推動提高最低工資，而不是在聯邦層面。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，民主黨人又一次推動了每小時15美元的聯邦最低工資。他們\n可能有衆議院的投票，總統將簽署，但它\n似乎有點不太可能，它將得到通過參議院。我想你可以讓\n一個合理的論點，大多數美國人都想這樣... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-a750849f-ef0e-5916-8c99-55c22b5c19ed","excerpt":"Just for context I'm a Brit who has an interest in American politics.\n\n\n\nIn my opinion 2016 broke politics for both the US and the UK.
