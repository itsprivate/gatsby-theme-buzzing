Under capitalism, people are allowed to give money or possessions to anyone they want. Therefore, voluntary socialism could exist within a capitalist society, and gigantic differences in wealth do not have to exist.</p>\n\n<p>No rules within capitalism prevent people from organizing a system where, for example, people&#39;s income is voluntarily capped at $1 million per year, and whatever other money is made gets voluntarily donated to those in need. You could say that&#39;s naive to think that something like this would happen in a capitalist society, but I&#39;m not saying that it would. I&#39;m saying capitalism allows for something like this to happen, but it requires a general populace with a certain type morality. The opposite is also true. Capitalism could obviously allow for a nightmare of needless death and suffering.</p>\n\n<p>As to what further conclusions can be drawn from this, I&#39;d say that perhaps capitalism is not one of the main problems or solutions in the world. Perhaps one of the main problems in the world is that humans generally have a hard time sufficiently valuing the well-being of those they don&#39;t know.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kn70nz/cmv_capitalism_is_neither_inherently_good_nor_bad/","title":"CMV: Capitalism is neither inherently good nor bad, but rather a neutral system where whether or not it leads to prosperity for the general populace is largely dependent on the morality of the people in a capitalist society (especially the rich/powerful people).","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"December 31, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-31T09:46:21.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-31 09:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"1ff04bed-b428-5d3b-9569-3230ad1664f7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kn70nz/cmv_capitalism_is_neither_inherently_good_nor_bad/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kn70nz/cmv_capitalism_is_neither_inherently_good_nor_bad/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"saleemkarim","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/saleemkarim","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"saleemkarim","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：资本主义本来就不好也不坏，而是一种中立的制度，它是否能给普通民众带来繁荣，在很大程度上取决于资本主义社会中人们(特别是有钱人/有权势的人)的道德。","the_new_excerpt":"需要说明的是，我并不是在为资本主义辩护或反对。在资本主义下，人们\n可以给他们想要的任何人钱或财产。所以呢，\n自愿社会主义可以存在于资本主义社会中，而且\n贫富差距不一定非得存在。\n\n资本主义内部没有规则…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：資本主義本來就不好也不壞，而是一種中立的制度，它是否能給普通民衆帶來繁榮，在很大程度上取決於資本主義社會中人們(特別是有錢人/有權勢的人)的道德。","the_new_excerpt":"需要說明的是，我並不是在爲資本主義辯護或反對。在資本主義下，人們\n可以給他們想要的任何人錢或財產。所以呢，\n自願社會主義可以存在於資本主義社會中，而且\n貧富差距不一定非得存在。\n\n資本主義內部沒有規則…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3eb8e462-341b-5f69-ad9c-8e6e7660f7be","excerpt":"This is probably the go to argument for anyone who can't justify some specific\nlaw and custom despite the harm it might bring but also wants to keep it for\nsome reason.\n\nThe argument seems to ignore that the world can improve and in fact did, mainly\nbecause of people who didn't accept the status…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/knighn/cmv_life_is_unfair_and_thats_the_way_it_is_just/","title":"CMV: \"Life is unfair\" and \"That's the way it is, just accept it\" are worthless in discussions about changes in society and laws.","date":"December 31, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：“生活是不公平的”和“就是这样，接受它”在讨论社会和法律的变化时是毫无价值的。","the_new_excerpt":"对于任何人来说，这可能是他们不能证明一些具体的\n法律和习俗，尽管它可能会带来危害，但也想把它保留下去\n有些原因。\n\n这一论点似乎忽略了世界可以改善，而且实际上确实改善了，主要是\n因为那些不接受…状态的人","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：“生活是不公平的”和“就是這樣，接受它”在討論社會和法律的變化時是毫無價值的。","the_new_excerpt":"對於任何人來說，這可能是他們不能證明一些具體的\n法律和習俗，儘管它可能會帶來危害，但也想把它保留下去\n有些原因。\n\n這一論點似乎忽略了世界可以改善，而且實際上確實改善了，主要是\n因爲那些不接受…狀態的人","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-0dee0379-ef41-578f-b09a-c1ca7f766c7c","excerpt":"I came across a clip of an actress I was looking up - she’s relatively unknown\nand I was surprised to see she’s done work in front of the camera much less been\ntopless (and I’m not going to link the scene).
