Governments and the laws that they pass should be treated like scientific experiments and follow the scientific method: Observation - Hypothesis - Test - Refine. </p>\n\n<p>Observe and identify societal problems. Formulate an idea as to how to fix it. Establish objective criteria upon which to judge the proposed solution and put it into action. Collect data to see if the solution is working as intended, and if it is not, tweak the solution or scrap it altogether and start again. </p>\n\n<p>I understand that underlying power structures will never let this happen. I also understand that agreeing to objective criteria is much easier said than done, and that partisanship in this paradigm would probably result in attempts to undermine solutions that are working but are not your own. That said, until we evolve to the point where the above is possible, I don’t think we’ll ever transcend the current global status quo that only really works for those at the top.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ljtkcq/cmv_governments_should_be_run_like_experiments/","title":"CMV: Governments Should be Run Like Experiments.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-15T02:37:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-15 02:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"e85c621a-ea7a-5c24-9429-b5077e7481aa","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ljtkcq/cmv_governments_should_be_run_like_experiments/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ljtkcq/cmv_governments_should_be_run_like_experiments/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"almostjay","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/almostjay","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"almostjay","score":58,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：政府应该像实验一样运行。","the_new_excerpt":"很简单的概念。政府和它们通过的法律应该被视为是一个简单的概念。\n喜欢科学实验，遵循科学方法。观察...\n假设--检验--完善。\n\n观察并找出社会问题。形成一个如何解决它的想法。\n建立客观标准，根据...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：政府應該像實驗一樣運行。","the_new_excerpt":"很簡單的概念。政府和它們通過的法律應該被視爲是一個簡單的概念。\n喜歡科學實驗，遵循科學方法。觀察...\n假設--檢驗--完善。\n\n觀察並找出社會問題。形成一個如何解決它的想法。\n建立客觀標準，根據...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-7e863702-f1cb-501c-aaa3-7d305826dad3","excerpt":"I love stories where the villain is relatable, where even if you do not agree\nwith his/her goals or methods, you can still understand his/her motivation.\nGreed, envy, pride, wrath, and vengeance are all easily relatable motivations\nfor an evil actor, but the \"burn it all down\" trope has never sat…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ljzpse/cmv_in_stories_where_the_antagonists_goal_seems/","title":"CMV: In stories where the antagonist's goal seems to be the total annihilation of humanity or all life, rarely does that antagonist's motivation make sense.","date":"February 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：在故事中，反面人物的目标似乎是彻底消灭人类或所有生命，很少有那个反面人物的动机是合理的。","the_new_excerpt":"我喜欢故事中的反派是可亲的，即使你不同意的地方\n他/她的目标或方法，你仍然可以理解他/她的动机。\n贪婪、嫉妒、骄傲、愤怒和复仇都是很容易让人联想到的动机。\n对于一个邪恶的演员，但 \"烧毁一切 \"的套路从来没有坐... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：在故事中，反面人物的目標似乎是徹底消滅人類或所有生命，很少有那個反面人物的動機是合理的。","the_new_excerpt":"我喜歡故事中的反派是可親的，即使你不同意的地方\n他/她的目標或方法，你仍然可以理解他/她的動機。\n貪婪、嫉妒、驕傲、憤怒和復仇都是很容易讓人聯想到的動機。\n對於一個邪惡的演員，但 \"燒燬一切 \"的套路從來沒有坐... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-168d2258-2f17-5136-ba34-0924288b38cc","excerpt":"I have met P.O.C who are clearly racist and women who blindly hate men.
