It seemed like in that scene and so many others I’ve seen the characters are in a hurry, and having a conversation they might have as well had over a cup of coffee.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that nudity that has a role to play when you’re presenting the human body in its natural form without sexualizing it. And that presents limited opportunities. But when used in a sexual setting it either looks like straight up smut or needs to addition of story moving dialog to prevent the scene from looking like smut. </p>\n\n<p>Either way, I don’t see what explicit depiction of nudity contribute beyond titillation. We know the actors don’t really engage in sexually intercourse in most mainstream movies so what difference does it make if the female costar bares her full chest or more?
