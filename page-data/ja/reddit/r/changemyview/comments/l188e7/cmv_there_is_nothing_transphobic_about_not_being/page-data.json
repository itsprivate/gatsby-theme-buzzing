For example, someone who is biologically male might not feel comfortable living his life the way a typical male is expected to, leading to him wishing to, or hopefully managing to make the transition to female.</p>\n\n<p>But, physical attraction isn&#39;t based on identity, but on each individual&#39;s response to the biology of someone else. A gay man isn&#39;t (initially) attracted to other men based on them identifying as a man, but by the physical, biological characteristics that come with being a biologically male. </p>\n\n<p>**Please take into account that I&#39;m talking about averages here, of course some gay men are attracted to more feminine looking men, some straight men are attracted to more manly looking women etc. However, these aspects regarding attraction that I&#39;m discussing here are generally true to the majority of the population. Also, I&#39;m speaking about INITIAL attraction, since of course a very attractive person who has a bad personality turns others off.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I&#39;ve seen people argue that if a straight man says he would not date a trans woman, that makes him transphobic because, allegedly, he doesn&#39;t see her as a woman. However, attraction doesn&#39;t have anything to do with respecting other people&#39;s identity. This hypothetical man I&#39;m talking about isn&#39;t attracted to the identity of a woman, but to her physical characteristics. He would just as well not feel any attraction whatsoever to a cis woman who is tall, has a deep voice, or has a wider frame. It won&#39;t matter to him that she was both assigned female at birth and that she still identifies as such, all that matters is whether her traits match the feminine traits he naturally finds attractive.</p>\n\n<p>The sad reality is that the success stories we find of people transitioning are not the norm, but outliers. The vast majority of trans people simply don&#39;t have access to all the hormones and reconstructive surgeries they would need to look completely indistinguishable from the opposite sex. Plus, bottom surgery is a MAJOR operation that maybe not everyone is ready to go through. It&#39;s not something you do during your lunch break. And while it is tragic that there is not simpler alternative to changing your genitals, people are completely entitled to their preference of these. It&#39;s not all about &quot;seeing women as walking vaginas&quot; or &quot;seeing men as walking penises&quot;, if your straight, you have absolutely no interest in ever interacting with genitals that are the same as your, and if you&#39;re gay there&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with not wanting to interact with genitals that are different. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Attraction is not based on respecting someone else&#39;s identity, but on biology. You can respect trans people without being attracted to them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/l188e7/cmv_there_is_nothing_transphobic_about_not_being/","title":"CMV: There is nothing transphobic about not being attracted to trans people","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-20T16:32:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-20 16:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"617ede01-eeeb-58b5-89b2-b5e5acea35ea","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l188e7/cmv_there_is_nothing_transphobic_about_not_being/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l188e7/cmv_there_is_nothing_transphobic_about_not_being/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"farckashkun","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/farckashkun","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"farckashkun","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：不被变性人吸引并没有什么变性恐惧症。","the_new_excerpt":"既然明确了性别和生理性别是两回事，那就说明\n首先是一套社会建构和期望，这些社会建构和期望被分配给\n每个人在出生的时候都会根据第二种情况，变性就意味着这两种情况。\n方面不匹配的人。比如说，一个人如果...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：不被變性人吸引並沒有什麼變性恐懼症。","the_new_excerpt":"既然明確了性別和生理性別是兩回事，那就說明\n首先是一套社會建構和期望，這些社會建構和期望被分配給\n每個人在出生的時候都會根據第二種情況，變性就意味着這兩種情況。\n方面不匹配的人。比如說，一個人如果...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3d689ef5-047b-5984-ad08-64efb1e8acc8","excerpt":"President-elect Joe Biden announced his plan to provide an 8-year path to\ncitizenship for people living in the US without legal status.\nhttps://apnews.com/article/biden-8-year-citizenship-path-immigrants-4f2dffdb7a688e1e126a62a8acd59730\n\nI am a frontline healthcare worker who has been in the US…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/l10fe2/cmv_illegal_immigrants_should_not_be_able_to/","title":"CMV: Illegal immigrants should NOT be able to obtain citizenship faster than legal immigrants","date":"January 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：非法移民不应该比合法移民更快地获得公民身份。","the_new_excerpt":"当选总统乔-拜登宣布了他的计划，提供了一条8年的道路。\n在美国居住的没有合法身份的人的公民身份。\nhttps://apnews.com/article/biden-8-year-citizenship-path-immigrants-4f2dffdb7a688e1e126a62a8acd59730\n\n我是一名一线医护人员，曾在美国...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：非法移民不應該比合法移民更快地獲得公民身份。","the_new_excerpt":"當選總統喬-拜登宣佈了他的計劃，提供了一條8年的道路。\n在美國居住的沒有合法身份的人的公民身份。\nhttps://apnews.com/article/biden-8-year-citizenship-path-immigrants-4f2dffdb7a688e1e126a62a8acd59730\n\n我是一名一線醫護人員，曾在美國...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-529fdf90-38c3-59cf-91b4-e3bc1a888852","excerpt":"Some of the most controversial pardons issued by Presidents in recent history\n(including the pardoning of Richard Nixon and a number of pardons issued by\nDonald Trump) were to people who were not yet tried and convicted of a crime.\n\nThe unilateral and unchecked pardoning power of a U.S. President is…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/l17845/cmv_the_pardoning_power_of_the_us_president/","title":"CMV: The pardoning power of the U.S. President should not extend to those who have not yet been convicted of a crime.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 20, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：美国总统的赦免权不应扩大到那些尚未被定罪的人。","the_new_excerpt":"近代史上一些最具争议性的总统赦免令。\n(包括对理查德-尼克松的赦免，以及一些人发布的赦免令)。\n唐纳德-特朗普（Donald Trump）是对那些还没有被审判和定罪的人。\n\n美国总统单方面的、不受约束的赦免权是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：美國總統的赦免權不應擴大到那些尚未被定罪的人。","the_new_excerpt":"近代史上一些最具爭議性的總統赦免令。\n(包括對理查德-尼克松的赦免，以及一些人發佈的赦免令)。\n唐納德-特朗普（Donald Trump）是對那些還沒有被審判和定罪的人。\n\n美國總統單方面的、不受約束的赦免權是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-617ede01-eeeb-58b5-89b2-b5e5acea35ea","previousId":"RedditPost-3d689ef5-047b-5984-ad08-64efb1e8acc8","nextId":"RedditPost-529fdf90-38c3-59cf-91b4-e3bc1a888852","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/l188e7/cmv_there_is_nothing_transphobic_about_not_being/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
