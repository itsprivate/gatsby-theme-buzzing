I&#39;ll be watching something then someone will do the exact thing, i hate it. a big part of watching TV or Films is watching character development, the beauty of watching TV is watching how characters unfold and how much they mean within the story. And knowing that someone will be a big character is something i wish i didnt know. i know its so easy to do but i just dont see why people HAVE to say it.</p>\n\n<p>The way i see it, If you&#39;re watching a TV series or film that you&#39;ve seen before with someone who hasnt seen it before, you&#39;ve gotta act like its your first time watching it too. i cant stand it when people say things like &quot;Are you up to the bit where....&quot;, No im not, but cheers because now i know that is going to happen. Or &quot;You&#39;re gonna hate him soon&quot;, great now i know he&#39;s gonna do something big so cheers for that. Or &quot;you&#39;ll love whats about to happen&quot; great so now im expecting something.</p>\n\n<p>The whole reason we dont like spoilers is because we dont want to expect is gonna happen.
