I can’t see the Tucker Carlson’s and the Tomi Lahren’s of the world being on board with the Montgomery Bus Boycott. </p>\n\n<p>And I can also totally see this same crowd making a “but what about the economy?” argument against the abolition of slavery back in the middle of the 19th Century. Does anyone honestly believe the Ben Shapiro’s of the world would’ve been supportive of civil rights back in the day if they shout down those protesting unequal protection under the law today? </p>\n\n<p>This is not to say that Kaepernick is right on every issue - I disagree with him on a number of things. I’m simply saying that those whose first reaction to Black Americans protesting today is instinctual rebuttal also would’ve had that same reaction through every significant point in history. </p>\n\n<p>I’m open to changing my mind on this. I am also aware that Republicans were the party of Lincoln/Democrats were the party of the KKK back in the day - so any rebuttal that brings that up, please consider the history of political realignment.
