Since some people were offended by it, Cavani deleted the tweet and apologize. But now, the FA gave Cavani a <em>three-game ban</em> and a <em>£100k fine.</em></p>\n\n<p>Now, we should all fight against racism and we all now it&#39;s terrible. But c&#39;mon, he can&#39;t even speak his own language now? I get some people thought it wasn&#39;t right to say that word, but if you don&#39;t keep in mind the context then we may as well walk on eggshells whenever we are saying anything. </p>\n\n<p>Also, I think there&#39;s another moral debate here. The FA is punishing Cavani for saying something in spanish, his own language. They are, in a way, canceling his own language which it&#39;s bizarre. </p>\n\n<p>Cavani must also complete a course for breaching the FA rules which I think it&#39;s the right thing to do. But that should&#39;ve been the end of the story. Because a three-game ban, that includes the derby, and a 100k fine (some would say that it&#39;s nothing compared to his wages but it&#39;s still a tone of money) for saying &quot;mate&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, this whole thing was this big of a deal because of social pressure. I follow quite a few well known people from Uruguay (mainly sports related people) and I can ensure you there are cases like this every time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/knwmzr/cmv_edinson_cavanis_case_just_shows_how_political/","title":"CMV: Edinson Cavani's case just shows how political correctness beats common sense once again.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-01T17:07:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-01 17:07","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a31382cc-4bd6-579c-aaf9-b3066207ff7f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/knwmzr/cmv_edinson_cavanis_case_just_shows_how_political/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/knwmzr/cmv_edinson_cavanis_case_just_shows_how_political/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"ElmoOnSteroids","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ElmoOnSteroids","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ElmoOnSteroids","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：爱丁森·卡瓦尼(Edinson Cavani)的案例再次表明，政治正确性是如何击败常识的。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CJd3vWmASKO/?igshid=bknugbfikymf\n\n背景：卡瓦尼在Instagram上转发了他的一位朋友与\n标题“Granacias negrito👍”，意思是“感谢伙伴👍”。因为有些人\n卡瓦尼被激怒了，他删除了这条推文并道歉。但现在，FA…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：愛丁森·卡瓦尼(Edinson Cavani)的案例再次表明，政治正確性是如何擊敗常識的。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CJd3vWmASKO/?igshid=bknugbfikymf\n\n背景：卡瓦尼在Instagram上轉發了他的一位朋友與\n標題“Granacias negrito👍”，意思是“感謝夥伴👍”。因爲有些人\n卡瓦尼被激怒了，他刪除了這條推文並道歉。但現在，FA…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25600011","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25600011","title":"Best of HN 2020","date":"January 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2020年度最佳HN","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2020年度最佳HN","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-3ae4b6cb-b6bf-5d57-8e17-197272cb6349","excerpt":"This CMV is not about the reasons why people become homeless.
