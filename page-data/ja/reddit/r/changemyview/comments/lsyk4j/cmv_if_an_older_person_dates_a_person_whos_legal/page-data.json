Think mid 50’s dating a 20-30 year old. I don’t see the problem with this? Firstly, <em>some</em> of these girls are explicitly in it for the money. These girls are making a conscious decision about dating an older dude, none of them are forcing them. How can they be the victim? How are they perverts for this? I’ve never seen anyone say anything about the reversal of roles even when it’s a part of the topic. And I’ve asked this to many people but all the SJW’s just call me sexist. So if anyone has actually valid points let me know and CMV but honestly I can’t think of any! These people aren’t impressionable teens, they are adults who know what they’re doing. Unless they’re getting forced into it, I don’t see the problem in this.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I’ve had a change of mind. Although sometimes I could see how a young person is mature and the older person isn’t an actual predator, I guess most of the time the older person is actively looking for younger adults and that could be predatory behaviour. I guess although maybe most young people can use their conscious and not get manipulated, some do end up getting legally groomed/manipulated into a relationship which isn’t healthy. I guess it all comes down to the situation but I could see how most older people are predators for this even when the young person is consenting.
