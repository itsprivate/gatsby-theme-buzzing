Several Pokedex entries tell of its destructive capability and how powerful it is. Such an awesome and frightening being should be considered dragon-like, no? Here are my arguments:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It looks like a dragon. I know this is a weak point because Applin exists, but come on. Gyarados is modeled after an eastern dragon.</p></li>\n<li><p>Type advantages. This poor thing is allergic to electric attacks. Granted, it has a serviceable Sp. Def. stat, but ×4 weakness to electric attacks makes what&#39;s supposed to be this powerful giant into kind of a laughing stock. </p></li>\n<li><p>Payoff. Magikarp levels up slowly. If you have no Exp. Share, it&#39;s grueling. Dragon types (at least in the earlier generations) are scarce and powerful. This would make training a Magikarp so worth it. </p></li>\n<li><p>Gyarados is Gen 1. There is only one evolutionary line of dragon types, which would be the Dragonite line. Gen 1 was severely lacking in dragon variety. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t a hill I&#39;ll die on, but I have no idea why GameFreak made Gyarados water/flying. It should&#39;ve been water/dragon.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/mgtmea/cmv_gyarados_shouldve_been_waterdragon_type_not/","title":"CMV: Gyarados should've been water/dragon type, not water/flying.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-31T14:42:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-31 14:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ff501017-3287-5211-acb4-d15be8210964","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mgtmea/cmv_gyarados_shouldve_been_waterdragon_type_not/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mgtmea/cmv_gyarados_shouldve_been_waterdragon_type_not/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"schwenomorph","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/schwenomorph","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"schwenomorph","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：Gyarados应该是水/龙型，而不是水/飞型。","the_new_excerpt":"Gyarados从弱小的和令人失望的Magikarp进化而来，这就是使\n它特别令人难忘。几个Pokedex条目讲述了它的破坏性的\n能力以及它的强大。如此可怕的存在，应该\n被认为是龙形，不是吗？以下是我的论点。\n\n 1. 它看起来...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：Gyarados應該是水/龍型，而不是水/飛型。","the_new_excerpt":"Gyarados從弱小的和令人失望的Magikarp進化而來，這就是使\n它特別令人難忘。幾個Pokedex條目講述了它的破壞性的\n能力以及它的強大。如此可怕的存在，應該\n被認爲是龍形，不是嗎？以下是我的論點。\n\n 1. 它看起來...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3ada05df-7ffb-53d5-8364-1cbfb582c670","excerpt":"I realize a certain amount of mandatory evangelism or outreach takes place, but\nambushing what was otherwise a friendly exchange is off putting and sometimes\nannoying.\n\nIt happens in the randomest of places: out for a walk in the park, overseas on\nthe beach, sometimes the person can get downright…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/mgnzjs/cmv_it_is_not_polite_or_normal_conversation_to/","title":"CMV: It is not polite or normal conversation to bring up your church or faith with people you meet with randomly in public","date":"March 31, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：在公共场合随意与人提起你的教会或信仰是不礼貌或不正常的谈话。","the_new_excerpt":"我知道有一定数量的强制性传福音或外展活动，但......。\n礼尚往来，不亦乐乎\n烦人的事。\n\n它发生在最随机的地方：在公园里散步，在海外的。\n在海滩上，有时人可以得到彻头彻尾的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：在公共場合隨意與人提起你的教會或信仰是不禮貌或不正常的談話。","the_new_excerpt":"我知道有一定數量的強制性傳福音或外展活動，但......。\n禮尚往來，不亦樂乎\n煩人的事。\n\n它發生在最隨機的地方：在公園裏散步，在海外的。\n在海灘上，有時人可以得到徹頭徹尾的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-338a7efb-a409-5b03-a785-fb5989a3c776","excerpt":"If you are from the United States or if you follow American politics, you’re\nprobably familiar with “the Founding Fathers” and/or “The Framers of the\nConstitution” (I’m just going to call them “the Founders” from here on) and\ntheir God-like wisdom and foresight.
