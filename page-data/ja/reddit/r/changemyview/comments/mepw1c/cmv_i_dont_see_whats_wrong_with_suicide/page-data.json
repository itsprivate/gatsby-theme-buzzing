If they come to me for advice, I really struggle on how to tell them/encourage them to keep living.  I&#39;ve been in their position but I really don&#39;t understand why people are so against suicide. If they don&#39;t like their life then why should we try to keep them here? Sometimes I just feel like telling them, &quot;I&#39;ll miss you but it&#39;s your choice&quot; instead of discouraging it. If they went through with it, I would genuinely applaud them for being so brave to do so. </p>\n\n<p>I know already know the argument &quot;But what about the suffering the families and friends will have to deal with&quot; But if the person genuinely wants out, then why is it so socially wrong to just let them do what they want, as sad as it is? :/ I know there&#39;s probably something wrong and twisted with the way I think because I don&#39;t know anyone with the same opinion as me so please help me to change my view</p>\n\n<p>Edit:: thanks guys for all the discussions I was barely expecting 5 replies so yeah it’s been interesting and insightful to hear opinions from other people.  I definitely know now to be more empathetic towards people around me</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/mepw1c/cmv_i_dont_see_whats_wrong_with_suicide/","title":"CMV: I don't see what's wrong with suicide","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-28T05:34:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-28 05:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"09ecfa40-5052-5e35-81fa-2f817ca63e24","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mepw1c/cmv_i_dont_see_whats_wrong_with_suicide/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mepw1c/cmv_i_dont_see_whats_wrong_with_suicide/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"riniqueeni","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/riniqueeni","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"riniqueeni","score":65,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：我不觉得自杀有什么不妥","the_new_excerpt":"我的很多朋友最近都在处理自杀的念头。如果他们\n来找我咨询，我真的很苦恼如何告诉他们/鼓励他们。\n继续生活。我一直在他们的位置上，但我真的不明白为什么\n人们是如此反对自杀。如果他们不喜欢自己的生活，那么... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：我不覺得自殺有什麼不妥","the_new_excerpt":"我的很多朋友最近都在處理自殺的念頭。如果他們\n來找我諮詢，我真的很苦惱如何告訴他們/鼓勵他們。\n繼續生活。我一直在他們的位置上，但我真的不明白爲什麼\n人們是如此反對自殺。如果他們不喜歡自己的生活，那麼... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e9ea9504-f887-5906-bc24-c9a05ec96515","excerpt":"I don’t think it’s right and fair to raise children and teach them a certain\nreligion growing up.
