From its inception, it has been problematic and heavily criticized. George Washington warned in his farewell address that a two party system in American politics should be avoided, as it will inevitably lead to division.</p>\n\n<p>George Washington was correct, it is problematic and it does divide the country. Not only that, but it creates a system where voters feel obliged to vote for their party&#39;s nominated candidate, despite how corrupt they are. This blind faith and support is an issue, as it allows candidates who are incompetent to have success. Not only that, but it also makes the government less affective as the politicians belonging to a party generally have to act within the party&#39;s accepted ideals, which does not allow for change at a sufficiently quick rate. Furthermore, it creates a climate where politicians are unable to achieve as much as they are divided among party lines, and even worse, often disconnects the country along sectional lines, for in certain periods the US has voted for parties based on geography. This furthers an already deep divide in the United States.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m39r7k/cmv_the_two_party_system_should_be_abolished_in/","title":"CMV: The two party system should be abolished in American politics","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-12T09:30:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-12 09:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"1f56d600-f73e-56a1-9759-d8bdbaf01a60","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m39r7k/cmv_the_two_party_system_should_be_abolished_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m39r7k/cmv_the_two_party_system_should_be_abolished_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"dwight12345","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/dwight12345","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"dwight12345","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：美国政治应废除两党制","the_new_excerpt":"美国政治中的两党制远非理想的制度。从其\n在成立之初，它一直存在着问题，并受到了严厉的批评。乔治-华盛顿\n告别演说中警告说，美国政坛的两党制。\n应避免，因为它将不可避免地导致分裂。\n\n乔治...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：美國政治應廢除兩黨制","the_new_excerpt":"美國政治中的兩黨制遠非理想的制度。從其\n在成立之初，它一直存在着問題，並受到了嚴厲的批評。喬治-華盛頓\n告別演說中警告說，美國政壇的兩黨制。\n應避免，因爲它將不可避免地導致分裂。\n\n喬治...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-628f9cc9-559b-5c5b-afc3-a2fbbafb89b0","excerpt":"pretty much the title. i feel like amongst all this \"is it t-phobic to not date\ntrans people?\" we are forgetting something fundamental, that when it comes to\nchoosing dating or sexual partners we SHOULD be allowed to discriminate as we\nwish, and any society that shames it people for exercising that…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m2zka8/cmv_even_if_its_racist_or_transphobic_to_only/","title":"CMV: even if its racist or transphobic to only date a specific race or gender, it doesn't matter because relationship is something that you should be allowed to discriminate at however you wish","date":"March 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：即使它的种族主义或变性人只约会一个特定的种族或性别，它并不重要，因为关系是你应该被允许歧视的东西，无论你想要什么。","the_new_excerpt":"我觉得在所有这一切 \"它是T恐惧症，不约会 \"的标题。\n变性人？\"我们忘记了一些基本的东西，当涉及到。\n在选择约会或性伴侣时，我们应该被允许进行歧视，因为我们\n愿望，和任何社会，羞辱它的人行使该... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：即使它的種族主義或變性人只約會一個特定的種族或性別，它並不重要，因爲關係是你應該被允許歧視的東西，無論你想要什麼。","the_new_excerpt":"我覺得在所有這一切 \"它是T恐懼症，不約會 \"的標題。\n變性人？\"我們忘記了一些基本的東西，當涉及到。\n在選擇約會或性伴侶時，我們應該被允許進行歧視，因爲我們\n願望，和任何社會，羞辱它的人行使該... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-55f27a67-dbcb-590f-b8a7-1b9b9f64d5d7","excerpt":"It's come to my attention that some people get really pissed when they get texts\nat night.
