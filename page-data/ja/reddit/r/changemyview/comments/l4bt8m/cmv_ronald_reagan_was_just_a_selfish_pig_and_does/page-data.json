Cut the taxes on the rich and screw everyone below them? Why???).</li>\n<li>Taking taxes as some evil thing (you know, the stuff that also provides us with necessary social nets and funding?).</li>\n<li>Start up illegal, small wars in the Middle East that continue to screw up the Middle East to this day. </li>\n<li>Could’ve given less of a shit about the AIDS crisis and the LGBT community at hand.</li>\n<li>Arguably re-started the Cold War (interesting how nuclear talk wasn’t so much in the books in the 70’s in comparison to the 80’s. 🤔).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The only reason why he’s celebrated is either from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Republicans (especially the clowns who treat poor people like they’re some inferior species). </li>\n<li>Some 80’s kids (Like, ya’ll, I grew up and the 2000’s, and even I think Busch was nothing but a warmongering torture fanatic).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I don’t see a great president, all I see is a profiteering pig who built a selfish, greedy economic and even social culture in our American landscape that continues onward to this day. I seriously cannot understand what brought a generation from “war is bad and peace is good” to full on “Oh, that money’s going to those poor people? Fuck them, I guess”. </p>\n\n<p>Please, tell me why I’m wrong and why I should continue to see him as an American godsend in the decade of “Greed is good”.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1/25/2021 EDIT</strong>: Wow, 5.2k upvotes? Tons and tons of rewards (surprised to get wholesome awards for a topic like this, but whatever)? Thank you guys so much!</p>\n\n<p>Lots and lots of back and forward regarding this topic. I didn’t even know the conversation behind this is still as lively as it has been here. I expected some upvotes and some comments here and there. Nope! I guess this topic still bites a lot of people  almost 20 years after Reagan’s death. </p>\n\n<p>So far, I did learn a bit more from this than I though, some good and some bad (forgot about the Contra scandal, crack, racism and what not). </p>\n\n<p>I can’t read them all and fully explore all the comments, so please forgive me if I’m slow to respond and/or give deltas! </p>\n\n<p>I will admit some faults in both my arguments and comments (the faulty Hitler analogy, the lack of other issues involved with my initial argument, my irrational stance against all Republicans, etc,.), all of which I should be more aware of in the future. </p>\n\n<p>So far, I still haven’t totally changed my stance on Reagan’s decisions and ethics. The homophobia, racism and scandals are just simply inexcusable in my eyes. I can, however, also kinda see why one would vote him on his economic stances back then, as devastating as their effects are to this day.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/l4bt8m/cmv_ronald_reagan_was_just_a_selfish_pig_and_does/","title":"CMV: Ronald Reagan was just a selfish pig, and does not deserve the large respect he continues to receive.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-25T10:09:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-25 10:09","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"84fa6462-0a2c-5a32-b184-a67662d245a6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l4bt8m/cmv_ronald_reagan_was_just_a_selfish_pig_and_does/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l4bt8m/cmv_ronald_reagan_was_just_a_selfish_pig_and_does/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Pixelcitizen98","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pixelcitizen98","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Pixelcitizen98","score":8424,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：罗纳德-里根只是一头自私的猪，不值得他继续得到大量的尊重。","the_new_excerpt":"我承认，我不在80年代，我想，真正的体验是什么\n给了他至今的尊重（虽然不是每个人都会尊重他\n当然）。)\n\n然而，我所看到的，涉及到政府活动的大规模转变和。\n社会政治的立场，继续动摇我们的...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：羅納德-里根只是一頭自私的豬，不值得他繼續得到大量的尊重。","the_new_excerpt":"我承認，我不在80年代，我想，真正的體驗是什麼\n給了他至今的尊重（雖然不是每個人都會尊重他\n當然）。)\n\n然而，我所看到的，涉及到政府活動的大規模轉變和。\n社會政治的立場，繼續動搖我們的...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e15ab648-fcb4-559d-9b27-bb8bad01e298","excerpt":"Admittedly, this is near to Trump and Parler being almost completely removed\nfrom the internet in a meaningful way.
