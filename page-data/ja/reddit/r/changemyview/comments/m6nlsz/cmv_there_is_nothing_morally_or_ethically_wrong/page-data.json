I unironically want to bring back the duel.</p>\n\n<p>I do not believe there to be anything wrong with two consenting adults agreeing to duel each other to the death. Nor do I think there is equally anything wrong with a consenting audience who are willing to pay to witness this match in a colosseum or other such sports arena.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn&#39;t even have to have weapons involved. I&#39;m in favour of all bloodsports in general. It could just be two guys duking it out with their bare fists (or girls). It doesn&#39;t even have to be to the death. A system could be easily implemented for opponents to &quot;yield&quot; or &quot;tap&quot; out, along with other strictly enforced regulation such as a team of paramedics on constant stand-by.</p>\n\n<p>The commercialisation of gladiatorial combat would also create a lot of jobs (trainer, ticket seller, commentator, blood cleaner, blacksmith) and stimulate the economy with ticket sales and merch and the like.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think our current society&#39;s want to hide violence from the public as if it doesn&#39;t exist in the real word, is a very healthy idea, nor a very smart idea in the long run. People are going to learn about the world&#39;s ugliness sooner or later - at least this way they can be more prepared (both practically and mentally) for it. Plus, it&#39;s not as if anyone&#39;s forcing you to watch. If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t participate in it.</p>\n\n<p>As for the argument that the &quot;normalisation&quot; of violence will only make people more violent on the streets, I would argue that the same can be said for just regular UFC or MMA. It&#39;s no different. At least this way, one can be provided with an outlet for their violent tendencies in a regulated environment. And, what? You think just because UFC has stricter rules, that means people will carry those rules onto the street when committing crimes? That they&#39;ll arbitrarily hold back just because the people on TV do? If someone wants to hurt someone, they will. That&#39;s the end of it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m6nlsz/cmv_there_is_nothing_morally_or_ethically_wrong/","title":"CMV: There is nothing morally or ethically wrong with consensual gladiatorial combat.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T04:44:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 04:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"2a00f76e-68fa-56cf-bef2-1e7ae4cd2a03","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m6nlsz/cmv_there_is_nothing_morally_or_ethically_wrong/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m6nlsz/cmv_there_is_nothing_morally_or_ethically_wrong/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"H0X0","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/H0X0","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"H0X0","score":104,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：双方同意的角斗在道德和伦理上没有什么问题。","the_new_excerpt":"这不是一个备忘录。我是100%认真的。我不怀好意地想把\n决斗。\n\n我不认为有什么不对的两个成年人同意。\n互相决一死战。我也不认为有什么不对\n与同意的观众谁愿意支付... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：雙方同意的角鬥在道德和倫理上沒有什麼問題。","the_new_excerpt":"這不是一個備忘錄。我是100%認真的。我不懷好意地想把\n決鬥。\n\n我不認爲有什麼不對的兩個成年人同意。\n互相決一死戰。我也不認爲有什麼不對\n與同意的觀衆誰願意支付... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-2cea3005-dfc5-5a50-98ca-f653c38483e5","excerpt":"I agree that there are many points in which a person can stop and go back before\n-for example- shooting up on some heroine, however, that same person does not\njust wake up one day and think to themselves \"hey, let's get addicted to\nheroine\".\n\nI mostly believe that addiction is not a choice because…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m6kp5y/cmv_addiction_is_not_a_choice_but_rather_a/","title":"CMV: Addiction is not a choice but rather a disease of the brain.","date":"March 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：成瘾不是一种选择，而是一种大脑的疾病。","the_new_excerpt":"我同意有很多点，一个人可以停下来，然后再回去。\n-比如说，向某个女主角开枪，然而，同一个人并没有。\n就在某一天醒来时，自己想 \"嘿，让我们沉迷于\n女主角\"。\n\n我主要是认为，吸毒不是一种选择，因为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：成癮不是一種選擇，而是一種大腦的疾病。","the_new_excerpt":"我同意有很多點，一個人可以停下來，然後再回去。\n-比如說，向某個女主角開槍，然而，同一個人並沒有。\n就在某一天醒來時，自己想 \"嘿，讓我們沉迷於\n女主角\"。\n\n我主要是認爲，吸毒不是一種選擇，因爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-59cf53bb-57c4-5721-85b3-2776f76087ef","excerpt":"A lot of sexual kinks and porn feature situations that are usually considered\npretty morally abhorrent, including rape, incest, cheating, abuse of power,\nsexism, blackmail, and more.
