He only won the nomination with a much smaller percentage (I think like 44%)</li>\n<li>I think the historical comparisons to folks like McCarthy show how quickly someone who once dominated a social space get shoved out.</li>\n<li>Ultimately Trump lost and looking at the Senate underperformed compared to a generic Republican, so there is a clear reason to not let him be the nominee.</li>\n<li>And to that point, with four years of behind the scenes work, Republicans who want to win will undermine him and push him out.</li>\n<li>Trump has a very particular style but has not shown an ability to modulate- which would be necessary for him to regain the nomination.</li>\n<li>You can add on the other weaker arguments, like he would be the oldest candidate in history, that he will attack and pillage establishment republicans, ... etc - I am not super swayed by these arguments - but I give them minimal weight.</li>\n<li>I don&#39;t give any weight to the argument that he will be in jail, or tied up in some extra ordinary personal legal fight.
