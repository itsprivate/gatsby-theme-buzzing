And this comes from days before the current pandemic, so its not the cause either.</p>\n\n<p>Now, putting aside very narrow ultraspecialized fields or very small/closed countries, I think that&#39;s just a whole lot of bollocks. I&#39;ll give two examples I know:</p>\n\n<p><em>- Friend of mine applied to work to stack the shelves at a supermarket. She was 100% happy to earn any wage at all, and willing to work any schedule as she lived close-by. She was turned down (nothing bad there, of course, it&#39;s life). However couple days down the road I got wind through contacts that this manager was complaining &quot;can&#39;t hire anyone anymore, young people just don&#39;t want to work&quot;.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Here&#39;s the thing, during the crisis years, 2010-2017, young people got shafted hard, and instances of unpaid wage, paid below agreed upon value, unpaid work-time, and so on, became extremely common, with traditional legal solution proving almost ineffective. As a result, nowadays anyone with some education, basic knowledge of the law and a few contacts and favors (which are cheap enough) can defend themselves. And if that doesn&#39;t work... well, other ways do. So what hiring managers target for unqualified position are people that will not know HOW to defend themselves, that don&#39;t have contacts and friends to pull from, and so on. Essentially people that will just shrug and say &quot;well, I got shafted a month wage, it&#39;s life&quot; if at some point that don&#39;t pay.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>- I worked construction for a few years, a few month here, a week there, in between classes, etc. Earned about 2000-4000€/y doing that. Recently got many calls to come back, and they were offering about 5k-6k/y. Comparatively sweet. However, I finished my degree and got a more regular job, earning about 75k/y at the moment. Well, most of the companies manager I talked to were downright rude when I said &quot;I earn X atm, can you do better?&quot;. In fact one company I talked with went on the local news and complained that people just &quot;don&#39;t want to work anymore&quot;, and &quot;young people are freeloader, can&#39;t hire anyone&quot;. Nah mate, you&#39;re just paying shit wage. This worked 5-10y ago. But nowadays the economy is better, unemployment is way down and so on.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It&#39;s not that there aren&#39;t people to hire. Even very specific experts, you can almost always pay extra and they&#39;ll come from further in the region. It&#39;s that people got wise to the crisis-era tricks, and that you want to pay 2013 wages in a 2019 economy. You can&#39;t hire or retain people because you give shitty conditions and nowadays people have alternatives. Simple as. And yeah, brain-drain is a thing, because you pay poorly. Pay more, retain the brains. It&#39;s not rocket-science.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/o4zdiw/cmv_in_the_vast_majority_of_instances_there_isnt/","title":"CMV: In the vast majority of instances, there isn't a \"lack of workers\", you're just unwilling to pay enough.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"June 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-21T20:37:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-21 20:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"98e5603f-4143-5e18-9ef2-610cb8ba146e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/o4zdiw/cmv_in_the_vast_majority_of_instances_there_isnt/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/o4zdiw/cmv_in_the_vast_majority_of_instances_there_isnt/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Head-Maize","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Head-Maize","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Head-Maize","score":168,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：ほとんどの場合、「労働者が不足している」のではなく、「十分な報酬を支払う気がない」だけです。","the_new_excerpt":"最近では、「光り輝く」起業家や経営者、CEOから、「Xの仕事には人が雇えない。\n仕事Xのために人を雇うことができない、最近の人は仕事をする気がない。\n最近の人は仕事をする気がない」「雇うのが難しい」などの不満を聞くことが多くなりました。\nしかも、これは現在のパンデミックの数日前の話なので、その...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：在绝大多数情况下，并不是 \"缺乏工人\"，你只是不愿意支付足够的工资。","the_new_excerpt":"我越来越多地听到 \"聪明的 \"企业家、经理和首席执行官的论述。\n抱怨说，他们无法为X工作雇用人员，现在的人\n现在的人不再愿意投入工作了，很难招聘，等等。\n而这是在目前的大流行之前的几天，所以它不...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：在絕大多數情況下，並不是 \"缺乏工人\"，你只是不願意支付足夠的工資。","the_new_excerpt":"我越來越多地聽到 \"聰明的 \"企業家、經理和首席執行官的論述。\n抱怨說，他們無法爲X工作僱用人員，現在的人\n現在的人不再願意投入工作了，很難招聘，等等。\n而這是在目前的大流行之前的幾天，所以它不...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-83f222c7-0d74-5e71-8df8-43504219535e","excerpt":"I believe there are mainly two types of cancel culture that we see today.
