Rather than expand the minimum wage, etc, we should focus on testing and implementing a scheme for universal basic income.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1 - Societal Goals</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s assume our goal in deploying welfare systems is to promote personal liberty, prevent privation &amp; starvation, and ensure a healthy consumer base -- and that we&#39;re balancing that against a need to maintain workforce participation, and maintain a healthy economy &amp; budget.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2 - What I mean when I say UBI</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m describing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Every adult, regardless of their income, gets a tax-free monthly payment of around $1,300 (enough to be over the federal poverty line if their income is zero). </li>\n<li>All other income is still taxed in a progressive tax system</li>\n<li>This plan replaces welfare systems like Social Security</li>\n<li>The payments do not change based on where you live; earning more money doesn&#39;t make you lose the payments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>3 - Why I believe a UBI to be superior</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Versus other schemes (like a negative income tax), UBI is much more likely to promote continued participation in the economy. Any money you make is good -- there&#39;s no &quot;income trap&quot; to make you lose your benefits if you get a better job.</li>\n<li>This is much, much easier to manage -- and because its simple, it&#39;ll require less bureaucracy, less overhead, and less policing.</li>\n<li>It&#39;s a future proof solution. It won&#39;t need to be retooled every time technology destabilizes an industry or puts millions out of work.</li>\n<li>It creates more natural and competitive markets. A lot of markets don&#39;t respond to supply and demand now, because one or the other is really fixed:\n\n<ol>\n<li>It&#39;ll reduce overpopulation in very expensive areas, and shift folks (who are looking for a lower cost of living in order to get more out of their UBI) into lower cost areas, making rent more affordable in the higher population areas.</li>\n<li>It&#39;ll make owning and operating a small business less risky, because business owners&#39; basic needs will be cared for -- which means more small businesses.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>4 - My response to some normal criticism</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><em>People won&#39;t want to work anymore.</em> That&#39;s not been the outcome in UBI trials in the past -- it&#39;s <em>basic</em> income, knowing you won&#39;t be homeless and will be able to eat enough to live isn&#39;t what most of us are working for anyway. If having these needs met meant you wouldn&#39;t work (even in pretty unappealing jobs), nobody in high school would have a job.</li>\n<li><em>It&#39;ll lead to runaway inflation.</em> Inflation is based on a disparity between demand and supply; for us to believe that we&#39;d see runaway inflation, there&#39;d need to be a set of goods that lower income people will buy (now that they&#39;ve got UBI) that they couldn&#39;t buy before, that <em>cannot be produced in greater numbers.</em> I don&#39;t think that&#39;s plausible, in general:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Some products are relatively inelastic -- that means you need to buy them, regardless of whether you&#39;ve got the money. This applies to food, gas, car repairs, and so on.</li>\n<li>Housing would indeed get more expensive ... if you didn&#39;t have the option of leaving for a cheaper market. If you can make $15K working at McDonalds and $15K from UBI, why not move somewhere with a rent 1/4 as high? UBI doesn&#39;t create more <em>people who need housing,</em> and so it&#39;s not going to make housing cost more as long as market dynamics can keep functioning.</li>\n<li>Luxury goods manufacturers generally cannot benefit from economies of scale -- ramping up demand often brings prices down, not up. For example, demand for hot tubs spiked massively this summer, all across the globe ... and prices came <em>down</em>, because manufacturers were able to perform much larger production runs.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><em>We can&#39;t pay for it.</em> This is B.S.; it&#39;d cost us about $2 trillion a year (which is, I admit, lots of cash) -- but the social programs we&#39;d cut are costing us about a trillion and a half. We can&#39;t figure out how to fund a five hundred billion a year?\n\n<ol>\n<li>Put the two top income tax brackets back to where they were in the 1950s. There&#39;s $400B a year.</li>\n<li>Put the corporate tax rate back where it was in the 1970s. There&#39;s another $100B a year. </li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><em>That&#39;s socialism.</em> No more so than any welfare program -- and it requires a good deal less government intervention than do our current models.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I&#39;m absolutely willing to change my view, but will be much more influenced by pragmatic arguments than philosophical ones; I&#39;m not interested in arguing about whether or not giving people &quot;money for nothing&quot; is fair or ethical, and I need rebuttals to be substantive.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lfhyzg/cmv_universal_basic_income_ubi_is_in_concept_much/","title":"CMV: Universal Basic Income (UBI) is, in concept, much more effective than a welfare state","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-08T23:32:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-08 23:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"657619df-2a61-5abc-9c29-17c06b9bf856","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lfhyzg/cmv_universal_basic_income_ubi_is_in_concept_much/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lfhyzg/cmv_universal_basic_income_ubi_is_in_concept_much/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"badass_panda","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/badass_panda","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"badass_panda","score":85,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：全民基本收入(UBI)在概念上比福利国家更有效。","the_new_excerpt":"如果你的目标是让工人保持绝望和无能为力，UBI可能不是一个。\n吸引人的概念 -- 所以我要缩小我的关注点，并使这个漂亮的\n干净。\n\n我的前提是：如果我们对一系列具体的社会目标达成一致（1），那么我们就是\n我的UBI纲要(2)要比...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：全民基本收入(UBI)在概念上比福利國家更有效。","the_new_excerpt":"如果你的目標是讓工人保持絕望和無能爲力，UBI可能不是一個。\n吸引人的概念 -- 所以我要縮小我的關注點，並使這個漂亮的\n乾淨。\n\n我的前提是：如果我們對一系列具體的社會目標達成一致（1），那麼我們就是\n我的UBI綱要(2)要比...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3e13b241-f92a-5ca2-bb41-c026defafa78","excerpt":"I did my math as follows: I googled the median income a US individual, and it is\napparently $31,133.\n\nThe work force in this country is about 150 million people.
