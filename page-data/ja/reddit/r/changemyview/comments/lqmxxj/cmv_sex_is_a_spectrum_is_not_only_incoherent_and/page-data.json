This argument goes beyond acknowledging that some people are intersex and have some difference of sexual development; it actually redefines what &quot;sex&quot; means altogether. It says we define sex not on the basis of chromosomes, but on the basis of physiology, endocrinology and genetics. I.e. you can look at a person&#39;s morphological make up to determine what sex they are, and there are potentially millions.</p>\n\n<p>I think I understand the heart of this argument, but not the conclusion it makes. I agree that we should value that people are all different, and that no one fits into a neat XX/XY box. People can be all kinds of body parts, hormones and genes, regardless of their reproductive function. Similarly, we shouldn&#39;t use the XX/XY box to give people gender roles, or medical advice.  Male shouldn&#39;t mean man, and female shouldn&#39;t mean woman. That much I agree with.</p>\n\n<p>The trouble I have with it though is that surely the logical conclusion you arrive at (if sex is a spectrum) is that in order to understand what a &quot;male&quot; or a &quot;female&quot; is, you have to use stereotypical morphological traits as part of the definition?</p>\n\n<p>What makes someone male, or &quot;more&quot; male according to this model? For example, if you chose one aspect of physiology to focus on - like height - what does height say about a person&#39;s sex? Is it that tall people are &quot;more male&quot; than short people?</p>\n\n<p>With the original definition of sex (chromosomes), we could simply say that males are on average taller than females, but that a female could be taller. If you found a XX chromosome person that is 6ft1, she is not male - she is just an unusually tall female.</p>\n\n<p>But with this &quot;sex is a spectrum&quot;definition, surely we&#39;re arguing that the tall person &quot;becomes&quot; male according to the model?</p>\n\n<p>This is where I don&#39;t quite get it, and think it sounds regressive if anything. At best you&#39;re saying that &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; are now words without meaning (which is incoherent), or at worst you&#39;re saying that you can use body parts, physiology and hormone stereotypes to define what male and female are. That you can literally perform some weird algorithm, adding up a person&#39;s body parts, hormones and genetics and say &quot;well, you are X% male, and X% female&quot;. I don&#39;t even know how that would work, or what it would be good for, other than to perhaps reinforce gender roles.</p>\n\n<p>Put the argument into a different frame. Computer programmers tend to be introverted, good at maths and people who wear glasses. But is that how you define a computer programmer?  Would you say, &quot;well, you&#39;re good at maths, you&#39;re introverted and you have glasses, therefore you are a computer programmer?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Surely to do that would just be stereotyping. But the &quot;sex is a spectrum&quot; argument says that we define sex in that way: by looking at the trend of stereotypical morphological traits a person has.</p>\n\n<p>So here&#39;s my view in a nutshell: sex is not a spectrum, it is a binary, with variations within the binary (genuinely intersex people), however sex must not be used to define the rest of what a person is. The real problem is the conflation between sex terminology (male/female) and social terminology (man/woman).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lqmxxj/cmv_sex_is_a_spectrum_is_not_only_incoherent_and/","title":"CMV: \"Sex is a spectrum\" is not only incoherent and wrong, it's damaging and regressive.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T22:41:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 22:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"90dc288f-bc2e-5c71-a76f-c12cd4f29004","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lqmxxj/cmv_sex_is_a_spectrum_is_not_only_incoherent_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lqmxxj/cmv_sex_is_a_spectrum_is_not_only_incoherent_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Elegant-Winner-6521","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Elegant-Winner-6521","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Elegant-Winner-6521","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：\"性是一个谱 \"不仅是不连贯的、错误的，而且是有害的、倒退的。","the_new_excerpt":"最近，我看到很多人提出这样的观点，认为性别不仅是一种。\n谱，但性也是。这个论点不仅仅是承认有些\n人是双性人，性发育有一定的差异，其实这\n重新定义什么是 \"性 \"的意思完全。它说我们对性的定义...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：\"性是一個譜 \"不僅是不連貫的、錯誤的，而且是有害的、倒退的。","the_new_excerpt":"最近，我看到很多人提出這樣的觀點，認爲性別不僅是一種。\n譜，但性也是。這個論點不僅僅是承認有些\n人是雙性人，性發育有一定的差異，其實這\n重新定義什麼是 \"性 \"的意思完全。它說我們對性的定義...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-45fd6433-80f5-525b-9d20-eae20c371e72","excerpt":"My view is that considering yourself to be left-wing, right-wing, liberal,\nlibertarian, conservative or subscribing to any political ideology is a mistake\nfor most people.\n\nIn truth, this is a very complex area and the approach to dealing with the\nquestions around how to manage our existence is…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lqpz6r/cmv_mass_subscription_to_political_ideologies_is/","title":"CMV: Mass subscription to political ideologies is killing individual thinking","date":"February 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：大众对政治意识形态的认同正在扼杀个人的思维。","the_new_excerpt":"我的看法是，认为自己是左翼、右翼、自由派。\n自由主义者、保守主义者或认同任何政治意识形态都是错误的。\n对于大多数人来说。\n\n事实上，这是一个非常复杂的领域，处理的方法也是非常复杂的。\n围绕着如何管理我们的存在的问题是... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：大衆對政治意識形態的認同正在扼殺個人的思維。","the_new_excerpt":"我的看法是，認爲自己是左翼、右翼、自由派。\n自由主義者、保守主義者或認同任何政治意識形態都是錯誤的。\n對於大多數人來說。\n\n事實上，這是一個非常複雜的領域，處理的方法也是非常複雜的。\n圍繞着如何管理我們的存在的問題是... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-502b6a12-98d9-5092-abd9-d470910154ba","excerpt":"Michael Che said: “Israel is reporting that they’ve vaccinated half of their\npopulation.
