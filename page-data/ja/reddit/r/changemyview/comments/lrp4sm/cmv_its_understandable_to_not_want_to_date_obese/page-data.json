Now, let&#39;s assume you&#39;re looking to date people based on looking for long term relationships. If they&#39;re obese because of thyroid issue or other genetic issue, that wouldn&#39;t be good if you were looking to have children.</p>\n\n<p>As well as: if it&#39;s obesity gained from emotional issues (such as SO dumping you making you feel unloved so you fill that hole with like ice cream or somethong) it&#39;s possible that they&#39;re not over them yet (possible not definite), so that could cause some unnecessary nonsense you won&#39;t be ready or willing to deal with. </p>\n\n<p>And possibly the worst one: lack of urge control. If the person&#39;s obese because they are unable to control their urges, that&#39;s not a good thing for a LTR. You were saving up for a vacation? Well you were, except that money has been spent on a new sports car, and now you&#39;re in debt.</p>\n\n<p>Now I should clarify: I don&#39;t hate overweight people or anything, I just think it&#39;s justified to not be villified for not wanting to date them for reasonable reasons. \nThat being said I&#39;m willing to change my view so...
