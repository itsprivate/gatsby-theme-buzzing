Child services should be given a fund that it can use to provide the mother with the full amount immediately. After this it should then be child services&#39; responsibility to send him the bill and pursue him in court if he doesn&#39;t pay.</p>\n\n<p>Doing this would benefit the child since the mother will now be able to consistently cover the living costs associated with him/her, while at the same time making sure he still fulfills his financial responsibilities as a father.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lvjj73/cmv_if_a_man_doesnt_pay_his_ex_child_support_on/","title":"CMV: if a man doesn't pay his ex child support on time, child services should send her the money immediately and bill him","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-01T23:35:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-01 23:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"aa5639b1-3f70-5615-b6a0-d70ac94c4ef1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lvjj73/cmv_if_a_man_doesnt_pay_his_ex_child_support_on/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lvjj73/cmv_if_a_man_doesnt_pay_his_ex_child_support_on/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"theinspector5","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/theinspector5","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"theinspector5","score":67,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：如果男方不按时支付前妻的抚养费，儿童服务机构应立即将钱寄给她，并向他收取费用。","the_new_excerpt":"在孩子的抚养问题上，一个共同的问题似乎是，少数人\n父亲不按时支付。这对母亲来说，可能会产生非常不好的后果\n特别是当你考虑到母亲可能不得不去医院的事实时。\n负债以支付孩子的费用，并最终支付... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：如果男方不按時支付前妻的撫養費，兒童服務機構應立即將錢寄給她，並向他收取費用。","the_new_excerpt":"在孩子的撫養問題上，一個共同的問題似乎是，少數人\n父親不按時支付。這對母親來說，可能會產生非常不好的後果\n特別是當你考慮到母親可能不得不去醫院的事實時。\n負債以支付孩子的費用，並最終支付... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-5555c6d1-cedb-5c60-8d8f-82cf4a347eb8","excerpt":"So, regardless of whether one supports the $15 Minimum Wage (I personally do for\nthe time we live in), it is fairly obvious that keeping it the same at $7.25 is\nat best ignorant or are playing the (small c) conservative position because they\nknow their real aim is unpopular.\n\nThose who support the…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lvfe12/cmv_you_are_either_for_raising_the_minimum_wage/","title":"CMV: You are either for raising the Minimum Wage or Abolishing it.
