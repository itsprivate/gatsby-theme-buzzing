I take issue with the latter, and as I read more and more of F. 451, I become more convinced of this. I can see how one may think that the warning of the book is to minimize the power of government, but I strongly disagree.</p>\n\n<p>Bradbury tells us how it happens through the words of Captain Beatty. In summary, the banning of books was not a governmental project, but rather a path that people went down themselves. Because the majority of people were going this way, and it only seemed beneficial, the government gave it&#39;s support. </p>\n\n<p>So here is what I think: The novel of Fahrenheit 451 strongly warns against having faith in the majority of the population, and challenging ideas before they become institutions. To question and have concerns. But not that government power is a bad thing. Not by a long shot.</p>\n\n<p>If you think differently, well then I will try to engage and see why you believe that.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/l74puh/cmv_as_far_as_i_can_tell_fahrenheit_451_is_less/","title":"CMV: As far as I can tell, Fahrenheit 451 is less of a warning against government power and more of a warning of blind faith in the majority.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-28T23:34:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-28 23:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"4a2f5b78-c42e-51fc-9a43-e6613f079b20","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l74puh/cmv_as_far_as_i_can_tell_fahrenheit_451_is_less/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l74puh/cmv_as_far_as_i_can_tell_fahrenheit_451_is_less/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Agnostic_Pagan","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Agnostic_Pagan","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Agnostic_Pagan","score":61,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：据我所知，《华氏451》与其说是对政府权力的警告，不如说是对大多数人盲目信仰的警告。","the_new_excerpt":"俗话说，什么形式的政府都不好，民主只是最好的形式\n我们已经有了一个。\n\n每当我看到人们谈论对政府权力的警告，我看到两个\n小说来了。《1984》和《华氏451》。我对后者有异议，而且由于我。\n读了越来越多的F. 451，我变得... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：據我所知，《華氏451》與其說是對政府權力的警告，不如說是對大多數人盲目信仰的警告。","the_new_excerpt":"俗話說，什麼形式的政府都不好，民主只是最好的形式\n我們已經有了一個。\n\n每當我看到人們談論對政府權力的警告，我看到兩個\n小說來了。《1984》和《華氏451》。我對後者有異議，而且由於我。\n讀了越來越多的F. 451，我變得... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ed5861b5-c208-5dc6-9fd3-7b64bf53461c","excerpt":"Average Americans have a negligible impact on legislation passed regardless of\nthe amount of popular support while gigantic corporations and those controlling\nthem have interests that government action aligns stupid closely with, the ultra\nrich can do whatever they want without consequences, and if…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/l6yisl/cmv_america_is_an_oligarchy_and_things_only/","title":"cmv: America is an oligarchy and things only change when the owner class wants them to","date":"January 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"cmv: 美国是一个寡头国家 只有当所有者阶级想改变的时候，事情才会发生变化。","the_new_excerpt":"普通美国人对通过的立法的影响微乎其微，无论\n巨大的企业和控制者，却没有得到民众的支持。\n他们的利益，政府的行动与愚蠢的紧密结合，极端的\n有钱人可以为所欲为，不计后果，如果...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"cmv: 美國是一個寡頭國家 只有當所有者階級想改變的時候，事情纔會發生變化。","the_new_excerpt":"普通美國人對通過的立法的影響微乎其微，無論\n巨大的企業和控制者，卻沒有得到民衆的支持。\n他們的利益，政府的行動與愚蠢的緊密結合，極端的\n有錢人可以爲所欲爲，不計後果，如果...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-f9f2912b-4bf9-5b09-ba76-5b2a1b0d3372","excerpt":"I am not using the word sex worker in a pejorative sense.
