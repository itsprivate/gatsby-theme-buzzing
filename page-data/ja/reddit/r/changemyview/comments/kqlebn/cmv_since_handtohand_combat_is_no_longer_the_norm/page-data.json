This was a big reason why drafting was for men only all throughout history. Nowadays, however, wars are fought using guns, boats, planes, cars, bombs, tanks, hacking, and the like, all of which physical differences do not affect (in other words, a soldier stepping on a mine is losing their legs, man or woman), and yet in most of the world only men are still drafted or expected to fight and not women (such as the Selective Service in the United States). As far as I know, no religion prohibits women from fighting in the military and defending their country, so I do not think it is a matter of religion. In my opinion, it is blatant sexism, but I would be more than happy to know everyone&#39;s thoughts. Of course, they would be given any necessary objects not needed for men (for hygiene and such), and they would be split from the men (no intergender squads for reasons such as turning from collaboration to competition).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kqlebn/cmv_since_handtohand_combat_is_no_longer_the_norm/","title":"CMV: Since hand-to-hand combat is no longer the norm, women should be drafted","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-05T03:54:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-05 03:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e5a039c1-55c3-5417-a58a-a36a6785d90d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kqlebn/cmv_since_handtohand_combat_is_no_longer_the_norm/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kqlebn/cmv_since_handtohand_combat_is_no_longer_the_norm/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"triumph_glamour","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/triumph_glamour","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"triumph_glamour","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：既然肉搏战不再是常态，就应该征召女兵","the_new_excerpt":"过去的女兵由于身体原因处于非常不利的地位。\n男人和女人之间的差异是毋庸置疑的。这是为什么\n从古至今，服兵役只为男性服务。然而，如今战争是\n使用枪支、船只、飞机、汽车、炸弹、坦克、黑客和…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：既然肉搏戰不再是常態，就應該徵召女兵","the_new_excerpt":"過去的女兵由於身體原因處於非常不利的地位。\n男人和女人之間的差異是毋庸置疑的。這是爲什麼\n從古至今，服兵役只爲男性服務。然而，如今戰爭是\n使用槍支、船隻、飛機、汽車、炸彈、坦克、黑客和…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-5f7ddccf-64d5-5616-adaf-9d3ecd54b592","excerpt":"PHOTO ID verification, to be clear.\n\nI think that every looks-centric social media app like Facebook, Snapchat,\nInstagram, and TikTok should require users to be at least 18 years old and\nshould require ID verification to create an account the same way that some\nonline investment apps do because:\n\n…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kqnxeb/cmv_no_one_under_the_age_of_18_should_be_allowed/","title":"CMV: no one under the age of 18 should be allowed on any kind of image-centric social media and those social media platforms should require photo verification to prevent minors from using them","date":"January 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：18岁以下的任何人都不应该被允许使用任何以形象为中心的社交媒体，这些社交媒体平台应该要求照片验证，以防止未成年人使用它们","the_new_excerpt":"带照片的身份验证，说清楚了。\n\n我认为每个以外表为中心的社交媒体应用，比如Facebook，Snapchat，\nInstagram和TikTok应该要求用户至少18岁并且\n应该需要身份验证才能创建帐户，方法与某些\n在线投资应用之所以能做到这一点，是因为：\n\n…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：18歲以下的任何人都不應該被允許使用任何以形象爲中心的社交媒體，這些社交媒體平臺應該要求照片驗證，以防止未成年人使用它們","the_new_excerpt":"帶照片的身份驗證，說清楚了。\n\n我認爲每個以外表爲中心的社交媒體應用，比如Facebook，Snapchat，\nInstagram和TikTok應該要求用戶至少18歲並且\n應該需要身份驗證才能創建帳戶，方法與某些\n在線投資應用之所以能做到這一點，是因爲：\n\n…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-202f06eb-aa17-5f50-a45c-88957e0dc1f9","excerpt":"I'm a centrist for the most part but a lot of the things that I typically see\nconservatives accuse of Liberals such as not accepting different views, taking\nthe extremists of the other side and saying that they represent the whole, being\noverly sensitive, name calling, constantly bringing up race…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kqo6eg/cmv_conservatives_are_doing_what_they_accuse_of/","title":"CMV: conservatives are doing what they accuse of Liberals.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 05, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：保守派正在做他们指责自由党的事情。","the_new_excerpt":"我在很大程度上是一个中间派，但我通常看到的很多事情\n保守派指责自由党不接受不同观点，采取\n另一边的极端分子说他们代表整体，\n过于敏感，辱骂，不断提起种族…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：保守派正在做他們指責自由黨的事情。","the_new_excerpt":"我在很大程度上是一箇中間派，但我通常看到的很多事情\n保守派指責自由黨不接受不同觀點，採取\n另一邊的極端分子說他們代表整體，\n過於敏感，辱罵，不斷提起種族…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-e5a039c1-55c3-5417-a58a-a36a6785d90d","previousId":"RedditPost-5f7ddccf-64d5-5616-adaf-9d3ecd54b592","nextId":"RedditPost-202f06eb-aa17-5f50-a45c-88957e0dc1f9","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kqlebn/cmv_since_handtohand_combat_is_no_longer_the_norm/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
