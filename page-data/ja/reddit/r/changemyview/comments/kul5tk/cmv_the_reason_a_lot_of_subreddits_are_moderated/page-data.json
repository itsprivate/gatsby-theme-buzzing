Removing posts and comments they don&#39;t agree with is all they have going for them. I just feel bad that nobody loves them so they have to come here and gain some fake sense of authority by silencing people that don&#39;t live in their mother&#39;s basement.Edit: Got a message saying I had to add more to the post, so here it is:</p>\n\n<p>I was discussing this with a power mod who says that if you don&#39;t like the sub, you should just stop using it because it ultimately belongs to the creators or moderators. I understand that point of view for creative subreddits such as <a href=\"/r/NotTheOnion\">r/NotTheOnion</a>, <a href=\"/r/TIFU\">r/TIFU</a>, <a href=\"/r/ELI5\">r/ELI5</a> and the like, but subreddits that people got a control over just because they were at the right place at the right time, subreddits that someone else would definitely have created anyway, those communities belong to the users and not the moderators. subreddits like <a href=\"/r/news\">r/news</a>, <a href=\"/r/politics\">r/politics</a>, <a href=\"/r/soccer\">r/soccer</a>, <a href=\"/r/pics\">r/pics</a> belong more to the community than the people that created it.</p>\n\n<p>There aren&#39;t even a lot of communities with over a million subscribers, if the admins wanted to clean out the moderators and bring in new people it wouldn&#39;t take much work at all. The admins should feel some sense of responsibility when <a href=\"/r/news\">r/news</a> removes important news stories just because it doesn&#39;t promote their agenda.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
