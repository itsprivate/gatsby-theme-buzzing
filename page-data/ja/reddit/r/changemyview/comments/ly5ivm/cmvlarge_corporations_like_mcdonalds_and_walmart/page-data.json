I think there should be a legal destination between Regular Joe’s burger shack vs. Mcdonalds. If your mom and pop restaurant can’t afford 15/hr then they deserve government subsidies to assist them to create a good environment for their employees. But McDonald’s, -with a CEO who made 2000x their average employee- should be taxed extra. Bottom line. Over $150 billion in tax breaks are given between Walmart and McDonald’s, yet a notable amount of their employees rely on social services like food stamps, and Medicaid. No matter how we rationalize it, people need food and medical. When you can’t afford those things, you’re going to take every avenue available to secure them for you and your family.</p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr\nThe government should help small businesses pay their employees a living wage instead of giving large companies tax breaks and subsidies when a lot of their employees get government assistance.</p>\n\n<p>To</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ly5ivm/cmvlarge_corporations_like_mcdonalds_and_walmart/","title":"cmv:Large corporations like McDonalds and Walmart are mostly responsible for the degradation of the middle class.
