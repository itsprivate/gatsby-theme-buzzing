To each their own, and everyone deserves the freedom to love and be as they please.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, I find the argument that gets pushed to allow biological males who have transitioned to females, to compete against biological females to be straight up silly. There’s a reason a vast majority of sports have separate men’s and women’s divisions. An athlete who has grown and trained as a male and then transitions to female has a huge natural advantage (muscle growth, bone density etc.) against biological females. And even worse are instances where the transition hasn’t even been fully completed, and there’s a push to allow the athlete to compete against biological females.</p>\n\n<p>The solution in my opinion is to have an open or trans category. It’s not forcing an unfair matchup.</p>\n\n<p>Change my view.</p>\n\n<p>Obvious caveats: sports where the physical strength/attribute are insignificant are fine, and you can even argue instances of early enough transitions (but that’s an entirely different hornet’s nest).</p>\n\n<p>Edit #1 - have received a few comments that seem a bit ‘what about’-istic. So I’ll respond to some of them here:\n- no, I don’t think segregation between black and white athletes should be brought back (geez guys, that’s just awful)\n- yes, I hate that socioeconomic disparities exist in the world giving some folks advantage in all aspects of life including sports, and if I could cure world hunger, I sure as hell would, but that’s not what this topic is about\n- and yes, I do think trans women are women. Restrictive regulations around washroom usage and military participation are ridiculous in my opinion.</p>\n\n<p>Edit #2 - recurring theme of ‘Are you suggesting that folks are transitioning to get a competitive advantage?’ No, I’m not. I absolutely do not think that’s even a remotely common occurrence. However, I think it’s an inherent outcome of such a situation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m1oced/cmv_biological_males_who_have_transitioned_should/","title":"CMV: Biological males who have transitioned should not be allowed to compete against biological females in sports","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-10T13:30:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-10 13:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"3a8d12ff-0708-5606-beb6-d1f390b53b71","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m1oced/cmv_biological_males_who_have_transitioned_should/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m1oced/cmv_biological_males_who_have_transitioned_should/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"OhSoManyThoughts","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/OhSoManyThoughts","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"OhSoManyThoughts","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：不应允许已转型的生物男性在体育比赛中与生物女性竞争。","the_new_excerpt":"首先我要说的是，我是一个财政保守主义者，也是一个社会自由主义者。\n\n我不相信政府应该对人们的生活有任何发言权\n卧室和他们的身体。每个人都有自己的权利，每个人都应该有自己的权利。\n自由地去爱，随心所欲地去做。\n\n说到这里，我发现... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：不應允許已轉型的生物男性在體育比賽中與生物女性競爭。","the_new_excerpt":"首先我要說的是，我是一個財政保守主義者，也是一個社會自由主義者。\n\n我不相信政府應該對人們的生活有任何發言權\n臥室和他們的身體。每個人都有自己的權利，每個人都應該有自己的權利。\n自由地去愛，隨心所欲地去做。\n\n說到這裏，我發現... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-cb54f72b-49ce-54fe-9669-7cf92b47f458","excerpt":"Hi All,\n\nSo I'm gonna be honest, this is a pretty new view of mine and I want it to be\nchallenged prior to developing my full feelings on it.
