In my experience this is one area of a car that I commonly see has not been cleared before driving. If you have a tall vehicle, get a telescoping snow brush and/or a small folding step stool to keep in the vehicle for these occasions. </p>\n\n<p>Be safe out there!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/kt19g3/ysk_snow_should_be_removed_from_the_front_and/","title":"YSK: Snow should be removed from the front *and* rear windshield, all windows, the hood and the TOP of your car before driving","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"January 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-14T21:04:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-14 21:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"4365e4e2-7831-552d-916c-7e9fd617702c","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/kt19g3/ysk_snow_should_be_removed_from_the_front_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/kt19g3/ysk_snow_should_be_removed_from_the_front_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"Sudo_Nymn","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sudo_Nymn","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Sudo_Nymn","score":229,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK: 开车前应先清除前*和*后挡风玻璃、所有车窗、引擎盖和车顶的积雪。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么选择YSK：任何留在车上的雪都会对你或其他人造成危险。\n开车时，车身上的。\n\n车窗上的雪会阻挡视线。\n\n引擎盖上的积雪会飞起来砸在挡风玻璃上，挡住你的视线。\n道路。\n\n后挡风玻璃上的雪限制了你看清后方的能力... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK: 開車前應先清除前*和*後擋風玻璃、所有車窗、引擎蓋和車頂的積雪。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼選擇YSK：任何留在車上的雪都會對你或其他人造成危險。\n開車時，車身上的。\n\n車窗上的雪會阻擋視線。\n\n引擎蓋上的積雪會飛起來砸在擋風玻璃上，擋住你的視線。\n道路。\n\n後擋風玻璃上的雪限制了你看清後方的能力... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-34acd219-1b39-5421-b8d6-a287bace2799","excerpt":"Why YSK: Because although these feelings of euphoria are exciting, they can just\nas easily leave you feeling insecure and undeserving of the person you're\ninfatuated with.\n\nDon't let your dopamine trick you into believing they're absolutely faultless\nand that you're unworthy of their love.\n\nEdit:…","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ku2qj6/ysk_when_youre_infatuated_with_someone_your_brain/","title":"YSK: When you're infatuated with someone, your brain releases so much dopamine into your system that you believe this person to be perfect.
