A recent realisation is that I have read my last ever book in the usual sense. It&#39;s quite sad when I think about it given how much I love reading and even have a library in my house. What makes it worse was the last book I read was rubbish, I didn&#39;t really enjoy it at all but read it as I don&#39;t like leaving books half started. It was &#39;How Not to Die Alone&#39; by Richard Roper. Had I have known I might have re-read an old favourite or tried a random new genre. I&#39;ve never tried audiobooks, and I know there is a debate as to if it constitutes reading, but for me it&#39;s going to have to be the way forwards.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m79w99/i_have_read_my_last_ever_book/","title":"I have read my last ever book.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T22:37:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 22:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"6fc329cb-2d70-5e3a-a758-4bd806cb1ab6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m79w99/i_have_read_my_last_ever_book/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m79w99/i_have_read_my_last_ever_book/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"frezkey","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/frezkey","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"frezkey","score":366,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我已经读完了我的最后一本书。","the_new_excerpt":"最近，我意外地失去了视力。最近才发现，我已经\n读了我最后一本通常意义上的书。想到这里，颇为感慨\n鉴于我有多爱读书，甚至家里还有一个图书馆。是什么让它\n更糟糕的是，我读的最后一本书是垃圾，我真的没有... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我已經讀完了我的最後一本書。","the_new_excerpt":"最近，我意外地失去了視力。最近才發現，我已經\n讀了我最後一本通常意義上的書。想到這裏，頗爲感慨\n鑑於我有多愛讀書，甚至家裏還有一個圖書館。是什麼讓它\n更糟糕的是，我讀的最後一本書是垃圾，我真的沒有... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-af35a7f6-19a6-5d60-9176-78889e33a39a","excerpt":"When she was younger, I mean like 8 years old, she was sexually assaulted by her\nbrother.
