I was excited.</p>\n\n<p>His narration was charming and fun to listen to, however when he started casually mentioning the domestic violence that goes on between his parents (both ways), I thought ok, he&#39;s probably going to be exploring his childhood trauma or something, but no, he says &quot;some may call this xxx but we called it love.&quot; I write xxx because I can&#39;t recall the specific word he used, similar vein to DV.</p>\n\n<p>This was his parents throwing and breaking plates at other, shouting and swearing. Fighting to the point of talking about divorce.</p>\n\n<p>Then pretty early in the book, he says he stole someone else&#39;s poem for a writing contest(or a piece of homework that won something), he said his mum&#39;s idea was if you don&#39;t get caught it&#39;s not stealing. He was laughing while narrating and it sounded like a fond memory.</p>\n\n<p>Then there was his first meeting with his wife, can&#39;t recall the details but I remember cringing.</p>\n\n<p>I couldn&#39;t really find any reviews talking about these things, some negative ones criticize him being a narcissist, but most find him and his behaviour charming.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I also just remembered how he had to beat the shit out of someone who badmouthed his dad for his dad to finally recognise him(Mathew) as a &#39;good son&#39; &#39;real man&#39;....</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mfoo2g/anyone_else_feel_mathew_mcconaugheys_greenlight/","title":"Anyone else feel Mathew McConaughey's Greenlight has a lot of red flags?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-29T17:35:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-29 17:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"e80395e8-9b28-526c-808c-49a6b7db9a46","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mfoo2g/anyone_else_feel_mathew_mcconaugheys_greenlight/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mfoo2g/anyone_else_feel_mathew_mcconaugheys_greenlight/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"esiotrot9527","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/esiotrot9527","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"esiotrot9527","score":86,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"还有人觉得马修-麦康纳的《绿光》有很多红旗吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我喜欢他在电影中的表现，所以我下载了他的有声读物版本。\n回忆录/宣称的自助书《绿灯》。它的评分为4.26分。\n近62,000个评分。我很兴奋。\n\n他的解说很有魅力，听起来很有趣，然而当他开始。\n随便说说国内的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"還有人覺得馬修-麥康納的《綠光》有很多紅旗嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我喜歡他在電影中的表現，所以我下載了他的有聲讀物版本。\n回憶錄/宣稱的自助書《綠燈》。它的評分爲4.26分。\n近62,000個評分。我很興奮。\n\n他的解說很有魅力，聽起來很有趣，然而當他開始。\n隨便說說國內的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-f9e09897-f902-5d2e-947b-7ca4f8b82853","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mfp0wl/george_rr_martin_signs_fiveyear_eightfigure_deal/","title":"George RR Martin signs five-year, eight-figure deal for more HBO projects","date":"March 29, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"乔治-RR-马丁签下5年8位数的合约，争取更多的HBO项目。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"喬治-RR-馬丁簽下5年8位數的合約，爭取更多的HBO項目。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-fa0d5c0c-f1c5-5b1d-ba46-89ee41801258","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mfng3w/ebook_sales_rose_16_year_on_year_in_2020_to_their/","title":"e-book sales rose 16% year on year in 2020 to their biggest total yet, in a record year for book sales in general -
