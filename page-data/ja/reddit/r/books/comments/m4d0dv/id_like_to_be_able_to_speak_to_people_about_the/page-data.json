I&#39;m the only person I know who reads, it&#39;s quite disheartening not to be able to share my joy with people who have the same interest and understands. I recently started a new book series and I was excited to share it with someone, my best friend out right said she doesn&#39;t care about what I&#39;m reading and she doesn&#39;t want to know, my boyfriend said &#39;oh right&#39; and changed the subject and my other friends are just not interested in the slightest.\nIs there anyone else in a similar situation? I&#39;m currently reading the second book of the With me series by Jessica Cunsolo, it looks like I&#39;ll finish it before I go to bed tonight and I&#39;ll be starting The Deal by Elle Kennedy tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Edit for comments about book clubs and goodreads: due to covid no clubs are available right now, I will look into them online but I&#39;m quiet awkward when it comes to speaking to a group of people. I&#39;d like to get to know someone who is a part of the group first instead of jumping in completely, that way I might feel more comfortable.\nI joined goodreads the other week and all I&#39;ve really done is update my profile, I didn&#39;t know there were groups on there so thank you for letting me know.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m4d0dv/id_like_to_be_able_to_speak_to_people_about_the/","title":"I'd like to be able to speak to people about the books I like.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-14T12:27:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-14 12:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"6c44c349-a852-54cd-afcf-be3987f14a57","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m4d0dv/id_like_to_be_able_to_speak_to_people_about_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m4d0dv/id_like_to_be_able_to_speak_to_people_about_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"liveinafairytale","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/liveinafairytale","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"liveinafairytale","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我希望能和大家说说我喜欢的书。","the_new_excerpt":"我一直喜欢读书，但一直没有人跟我说书。我是\n我只认识一个读书人，不能读书很让人沮丧。\n与有相同兴趣和理解的人分享我的快乐。我最近\n开始了一个新的图书系列，我很高兴能与大家分享... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我希望能和大家說說我喜歡的書。","the_new_excerpt":"我一直喜歡讀書，但一直沒有人跟我說書。我是\n我只認識一個讀書人，不能讀書很讓人沮喪。\n與有相同興趣和理解的人分享我的快樂。我最近\n開始了一個新的圖書系列，我很高興能與大家分享... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3c3d0a92-0855-5a0b-8e69-069c9e4023f0","excerpt":"I found that jumping straight into \"adult\" books again left me unable to follow\nthe story.
