I don’t have a great memory so I spend a lot of the time trying to remember where they left off. Also, sometimes I don’t like the character or their storyline, but I have to read through it to get to the storyline of the one(s) I do care about, which are normally the ones I chose to read the book for. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve been reading Red Rising, the first three books were phenomenal. The author didn’t jump between characters, it was just the one characters POV and I loved it. Now on the fourth book, 5% in and there’s already three characters to keep up with! I only care about the one from the first three books, that’s why I decided to read the fourth!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/kx1jih/unpopular_opinion_jumping_between_different/","title":"Unpopular Opinion: Jumping between different characters on each chapter is just annoying.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T03:12:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 03:12","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"52833f1e-a18d-5294-ac8e-e82d85ab11c5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kx1jih/unpopular_opinion_jumping_between_different/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kx1jih/unpopular_opinion_jumping_between_different/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"per1pheral","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/per1pheral","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"per1pheral","score":17194,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"不受欢迎的意见。每一章都在不同的人物之间跳转，实在是让人讨厌。","the_new_excerpt":"可能会因此而被降权，但我严重不喜欢作者们\n在每一章的不同人物剧情之间跳跃。我没有\n记忆力很好，所以我花了很多时间试图记住他们离开的地方。\n关。另外，有时候我也不喜欢这个人物或者他们的故事情节，... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不受歡迎的意見。每一章都在不同的人物之間跳轉，實在是讓人討厭。","the_new_excerpt":"可能會因此而被降權，但我嚴重不喜歡作者們\n在每一章的不同人物劇情之間跳躍。我沒有\n記憶力很好，所以我花了很多時間試圖記住他們離開的地方。\n關。另外，有時候我也不喜歡這個人物或者他們的故事情節，... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-35fd424e-bac7-5aee-aaf0-51f6c2609645","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/kzk4li/ursula_k_le_guin_to_be_featured_on_upcoming_usps/","title":"Ursula K.
