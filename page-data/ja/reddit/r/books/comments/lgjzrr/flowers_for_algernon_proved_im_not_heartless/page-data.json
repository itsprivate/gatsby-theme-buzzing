I seriously think this may be the most heartbroken I have ever felt since reading a book. It&#39;s currently 2.30am in England right now and I am struggling to sleep because all I can think about is this book! </p>\n\n<p>It leaves me feeling grateful for the position I am in, and whilst I do not consider myself smart, I still possess a moderate amount of intelligence. I should already know never to take anything for granted, but this book reminded me yet again why I shouldn&#39;t, because others are in much worse positions. I think I am done crying in a fetal position now, but the sad, yet disturbing story is going to stick with me for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>If you too feel like making yourself into a emotional wreck then I highly recommend reading it. And for those who have already read it, please leave your thoughts on it! I would love to discuss this amazing book with someone!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lgjzrr/flowers_for_algernon_proved_im_not_heartless/","title":"Flowers for Algernon proved I'm not heartless.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T05:42:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 05:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"9c0ad147-a933-5454-9526-0de8b5e545aa","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lgjzrr/flowers_for_algernon_proved_im_not_heartless/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lgjzrr/flowers_for_algernon_proved_im_not_heartless/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"lansonjr","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lansonjr","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"lansonjr","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"给阿尔杰农的花证明我不是无情的。","the_new_excerpt":"这是我从小就计划要读的一本书，我现在已经二十三岁了。\n而该死的是，这是一个情绪过山车... ... 我真的认为这可能是\n是我看书以来感觉最心酸的一次。目前是\n现在英国凌晨2点半，我睡不着，因为所有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"給阿爾傑農的花證明我不是無情的。","the_new_excerpt":"這是我從小就計劃要讀的一本書，我現在已經二十三歲了。\n而該死的是，這是一個情緒過山車... ... 我真的認爲這可能是\n是我看書以來感覺最心酸的一次。目前是\n現在英國凌晨2點半，我睡不着，因爲所有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3347b885-71b4-5ab7-8d3d-a09f72b3ccb9","excerpt":"This isn’t necessarily a book suggestion or request but I just wanted to come on\nhere and wish all of you a great day/week/month/year.
