I am a huge fan of Michael Crichton, and this gave me very similar vibes. The attention to scientific detail and humor is everything. I loved how much detail was provided when Mark Watney solved problems, and how he used a realistic tone to explain how he was feeling. The movie adaptation was entertaining, but I felt like Matt Damon was an odd pick for Watney. My only real criticism of the book as well as the movie, is that the end seems rushed. In both cases, a few more pages/running time would wrap things up nicely. Overall, I have to thank this sub for this recommendation, and I’m going to read Artemis next.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lbbwp7/just_finished_the_martian_by_andy_weir/","title":"Just finished The Martian by Andy Weir","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T03:29:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 03:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"7934f4cf-127b-5ea9-b62c-551c6240ac37","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lbbwp7/just_finished_the_martian_by_andy_weir/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lbbwp7/just_finished_the_martian_by_andy_weir/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Level69dragonwizard","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Level69dragonwizard","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Level69dragonwizard","score":361,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"刚看完安迪-威尔的《火星人》","the_new_excerpt":"我绝对喜欢这本书。我是迈克尔-克赖顿的忠实粉丝，而这本。\n给我非常相似的氛围。对科学细节的关注和幽默感是\n一切。我很喜欢马克-沃特尼在解题时提供的很多细节。\n问题，以及他如何用现实的语气来解释自己的感受....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"剛看完安迪-威爾的《火星人》","the_new_excerpt":"我絕對喜歡這本書。我是邁克爾-克賴頓的忠實粉絲，而這本。\n給我非常相似的氛圍。對科學細節的關注和幽默感是\n一切。我很喜歡馬克-沃特尼在解題時提供的很多細節。\n問題，以及他如何用現實的語氣來解釋自己的感受....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-94e5d103-5ac7-54c2-a5cd-34a9316788f4","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lb7h3u/dantes_descendant_seeks_to_overturn_poets_1302/","title":"Dante's descendant seeks to overturn poet's 1302 corruption conviction","date":"February 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"但丁的后人试图推翻诗人1302年的贪污罪判决","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"但丁的後人試圖推翻詩人1302年的貪污罪判決","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-97060220-8e0b-59fe-8ad4-d419addd0cb8","excerpt":"My Kindle has a \"vocabulary builder\" function that saves words I've looked up\nthe definition for.
