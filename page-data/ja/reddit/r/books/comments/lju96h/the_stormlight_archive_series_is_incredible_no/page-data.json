Wow...I&#39;m blown away. Some things in particular that I&#39;ve enjoyed so far:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It&#39;s so refreshing to read high fantasy that doesn&#39;t rely on gendered violence. The main society depicted in the books does have interesting gender dynamics - only the women are literate, for example, whereas men can only use glyphs.<br/></li>\n<li>I want an author to fool me. I love to guess where books end, but I tend to be disappointed if I&#39;m right. Sanderson has managed to throw in so many curve balls that I&#39;ve never been able to guess the ending. His endings are known as &quot;Sanderstorms&quot; because so much happens at the end.</li>\n<li>I love when an author hides clues throughout the story. It&#39;s incredible to me that ONE LINE in the first book (that I completely missed the first time through) has massive implications for other books. </li>\n<li>The Cosmere universe itself is so well-plotted. The books are all tied together in loose ways - you don&#39;t have to read them all to understand the story - but the Easter eggs are fun. </li>\n<li>Like all other Sanderson books, the system of magic is unique and detailed. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I love the Mistborn series, and they&#39;re a lot faster to read, but the plots of the Stormlight Archive are totally worth the time investment.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lju96h/the_stormlight_archive_series_is_incredible_no/","title":"The Stormlight Archive series is incredible (no spoilers)","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-14T22:24:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-14 22:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"8ac1a475-bc55-5130-8d6e-2d2078df90b1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lju96h/the_stormlight_archive_series_is_incredible_no/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lju96h/the_stormlight_archive_series_is_incredible_no/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Saugs","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Saugs","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Saugs","score":66,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"风光档案》系列是不可思议的（没有破坏者）。","the_new_excerpt":"我总是被布兰登-桑德森的《风暴之光》的篇幅所吓倒。\n档案书，但我终于决定潜入。哇......我被震撼了。一些\n迄今为止，我特别喜欢的东西。\n\n * \"读到不依赖性别的高级奇幻小说，真是令人耳目一新\n   暴力。主要...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"風光檔案》系列是不可思議的（沒有破壞者）。","the_new_excerpt":"我總是被布蘭登-桑德森的《風暴之光》的篇幅所嚇倒。\n檔案書，但我終於決定潛入。哇......我被震撼了。一些\n迄今爲止，我特別喜歡的東西。\n\n * \"讀到不依賴性別的高級奇幻小說，真是令人耳目一新\n   暴力。主要...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-aaac8ee3-411e-5af7-8718-03d45b282dda","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/ljqfxz/where_should_i_begin_to_read_scifi_which_writers/","title":"Where should I begin to read sci-fi?
