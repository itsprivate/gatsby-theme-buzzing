I&#39;d read Of Mice and Men before and liked it, but wasn&#39;t blown away, but I wanted to give Grapes of Wrath a try. </p>\n\n<p>Steinbeck&#39;s descriptions are some of the most vivid, clear prose I&#39;ve read. The narrative structure, alternating between the Joad&#39;s journey and the broader context of what was happening, made the broader social context clear while making the history personal and real. Tom Joad is a great character, but honestly Ma Joad stole the show. She&#39;s easily one of the strongest, most tragic, most enduring characters I&#39;ve encountered. </p>\n\n<p>I also loved the scathing social critique of this book, especially in light of the widening economic divide and mass unemployment in the US that&#39;s been accelerated by Covid-19. If this book doesn&#39;t make you understand the argument for socialism and labor organization as an antidote to unchecked capitalism, you missed the point.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t normally gush about books like this, but this one&#39;s special. Read it, if you haven&#39;t.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ly069f/holy_crap_i_just_finished_the_grapes_of_wrath/","title":"Holy crap I just finished The Grapes of Wrath...","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-05T14:24:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-05 14:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"0c2d1fb8-976f-58d4-a882-d44411871a23","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ly069f/holy_crap_i_just_finished_the_grapes_of_wrath/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ly069f/holy_crap_i_just_finished_the_grapes_of_wrath/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"KieselguhrKid13","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/KieselguhrKid13","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"KieselguhrKid13","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我的天啊，我刚看完《愤怒的葡萄》... ...","the_new_excerpt":"我读过很多好书，这是我读过的最好的书之一。我想\n以前读过《老鼠与人类》，很喜欢，但没有被震撼到，但我想要\n试试《愤怒的葡萄》吧。\n\n斯坦贝克的描述是我读过的最生动、最清晰的散文。愤怒的葡萄》是我读过的最生动、最清晰的散文。\n叙事结构，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的天啊，我剛看完《憤怒的葡萄》... ...","the_new_excerpt":"我讀過很多好書，這是我讀過的最好的書之一。我想\n以前讀過《老鼠與人類》，很喜歡，但沒有被震撼到，但我想要\n試試《憤怒的葡萄》吧。\n\n斯坦貝克的描述是我讀過的最生動、最清晰的散文。憤怒的葡萄》是我讀過的最生動、最清晰的散文。\n敘事結構，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-887f7bf8-e06a-5f6b-8cd3-d623f6d73762","excerpt":"I can't remember how many times I have been asked what my preferred genre is.\nAnd sure, there are certain plots I enjoy more than others.
