Snowden’s death is the obvious go-to, but I’d also include Yossarian’s voyage through Rome at the end of the novel, Orr’s disappearance, and Kid Sampson’s/McWatt’s deaths. Furthermore, I was quite surprised by the poetic quality of Heller’s prose. You’d think it’d be contradictory to use elevated language when trying to be funny, yet Heller somehow makes it work. Perhaps his use of language is just another example of the many internal paradoxes the book lampoons.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m2mqat/i_just_finished_reading_catch22_my_biggest/","title":"I just finished reading Catch-22.
