I tried to read it, but gave up after 100 pages.</p>\n\n<p>I just can&#39;t understand what is good about it. It&#39;s certainly not writing, because it&#39;s really obvious that the author was a teen when writing it and didn&#39;t have much experience back then. It&#39;s certainly not the story, because from what I&#39;ve read so far, it&#39;s just Hero&#39;s Journey in a fantasy setting and a pet dragon. It&#39;s certainly not characters, because the main duo are a self insert and an Obi-Wan wannabe it seems. And I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not the lore, because stories told by Brom weren&#39;t very interesting and the world itself seems pretty generic.</p>\n\n<p>It seems like the author just watched Star Wars: New Hope and decided &quot;Aight, I&#39;m gonna do that, but with dragons&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Normally I&#39;d just brush it off as YA phenomeon, but it looks like there are lots of adults loving those books. Am I missing something? Does it get better the deeper I&#39;m in? Do I just have wrong attitude towards it?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m2o6sm/whats_the_deal_with_eragon/","title":"What's the deal with Eragon?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-11T19:21:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-11 19:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"a40d8947-7d4b-5188-8d39-9a41cd85f69e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m2o6sm/whats_the_deal_with_eragon/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m2o6sm/whats_the_deal_with_eragon/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Krejtek","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Krejtek","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Krejtek","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"艾瑞冈是怎么回事？","the_new_excerpt":"我买了这本书，因为我看到很多人都在称赞它。我试图\n读了，但100页后就放弃了。\n\n我就是不明白它有什么好的地方。当然不是写作。\n因为它真的很明显，作者是一个十几岁的时候写它和\n经验不足...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"艾瑞岡是怎麼回事？","the_new_excerpt":"我買了這本書，因爲我看到很多人都在稱讚它。我試圖\n讀了，但100頁後就放棄了。\n\n我就是不明白它有什麼好的地方。當然不是寫作。\n因爲它真的很明顯，作者是一個十幾歲的時候寫它和\n經驗不足...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-682d8b29-49c3-5b00-b159-270944fdac5a","excerpt":"An amazing philosophical short story.
