He was just telling me about a university acquaintance that he used to drink with occasionally, who was writing his master&#39;s thesis on Joyce. He was taking a course that focused solely on Ulysses, and mentioned how ridiculously specific their sessions sometimes were - in one case, the professor spent an entire lecture discussing a single semicolon in the book. Now, I haven&#39;t even read the book yet, but I&#39;ve heard this anecdote a couple times now and I&#39;m really curious to know: how could one mark of punctuation inspire around an hour&#39;s worth of discourse? And is this a commonly debated feature in the novel? Would readers recognise which semicolon this guy was talking about? I&#39;d be so fascinated to know, if anyone can suggest which quote/passage this could have been referring to. Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ljqync/readers_of_ulysses_do_you_remember_a_notable/","title":"Readers of Ulysses: Do you remember a notable semicolon?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-14T23:41:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-14 23:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"68fd57dc-2d19-5c26-b798-c6f69eb0d54b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ljqync/readers_of_ulysses_do_you_remember_a_notable/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ljqync/readers_of_ulysses_do_you_remember_a_notable/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"funnyapparition","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/funnyapparition","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"funnyapparition","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"《尤利西斯》的读者们。你还记得一个著名的分号吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我的伴侣在拖了多年后开始读这本书，我打算\n到当他完成。他刚刚跟我说了一个大学熟人的事。\n偶尔和他一起喝酒的人，他正在写他的硕士论文，内容是关于\n乔伊斯。他正在上一门只关注尤利西斯的课程，... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"《尤利西斯》的讀者們。你還記得一個著名的分號嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我的伴侶在拖了多年後開始讀這本書，我打算\n到當他完成。他剛剛跟我說了一個大學熟人的事。\n偶爾和他一起喝酒的人，他正在寫他的碩士論文，內容是關於\n喬伊斯。他正在上一門只關注尤利西斯的課程，... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-8ac1a475-bc55-5130-8d6e-2d2078df90b1","excerpt":"I've always been intimidated by the length of Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight\nArchive books, but I finally decided to dive in.
