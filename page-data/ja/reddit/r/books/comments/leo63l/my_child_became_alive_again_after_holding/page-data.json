They miss going in and having the freedom to browse and choose their own books.  I suspect many other children are the same way...extremely tactile and visual.  At this time, our library is only providing pick up service.  It has been at least 5 months since I&#39;ve been able to check out books for my children at the library.  Yesterday, because I got off earlier than usual, I was able to place some books on hold and pick them up at the end of my work shift.  </p>\n\n<p>After we had finished dinner, I reminded my son that I had brought home some library books.  He went to the library book box, chose 2 books and began reading.  He was so engaged and delighted to be able to hold a book in his hand and turn pages with his delicate fingers.  I listened to him read and laugh and get excited at the plot points.  It was refreshing.  When he finished his second book,  he jumped up and exclaimed, &quot;I feel alive....like my brain is becoming more intelligent because I&#39;m reading books!&quot;  I was so happy for him.  He was so engaged that he continued reading the other books well into the night.  He finally went to sleep around 11:30.  He was so happy that he had a smile on his face while he was sleeping.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate that that we did have the option of reading books online.  My other son probably prefers that method the most.  But for some kids, like my youngest child, there&#39;s nothing better than to hold a book in one&#39;s hands.  He has always been that way.  </p>\n\n<p>My local branch is located in an area if lower income, disadvantaged residents.  I wish they would take more consideration of that and extend library hours for this purpose as it is difficult to pick up books when a parent gets off around closing time (5 or 6). In addition, I wish the library could make known what new books (for children)  are available.  I am thankful to be given the option to pick up books.  I will do my best to make time to check out books for my children.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/leo63l/my_child_became_alive_again_after_holding/","title":"My Child Became Alive Again After Holding Physical Books From the Library","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-08T01:22:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-08 01:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3fd23599-a204-5b4f-be31-8ea9608d3f26","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/leo63l/my_child_became_alive_again_after_holding/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/leo63l/my_child_became_alive_again_after_holding/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"lyn73","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lyn73","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"lyn73","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我的孩子抱着图书馆的实体书，又活了过来。","the_new_excerpt":"我的孩子想念去图书馆。他们怀念去图书馆的自由\n来浏览和选择自己的书籍。我猜想很多其他的孩子也是如此\n方式......极具触觉和视觉效果。目前，我们的图书馆只提供\n接机服务。已经至少5个月了，我已经...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的孩子抱着圖書館的實體書，又活了過來。","the_new_excerpt":"我的孩子想念去圖書館。他們懷念去圖書館的自由\n來瀏覽和選擇自己的書籍。我猜想很多其他的孩子也是如此\n方式......極具觸覺和視覺效果。目前，我們的圖書館只提供\n接機服務。已經至少5個月了，我已經...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-941e602b-a4fb-5368-9676-ee13c9a72ee4","excerpt":"I know, I know, I'm an awful snob.
