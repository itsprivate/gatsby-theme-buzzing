There seems to be little forward movement with the next book. Meanwhile, he&#39;s been busy writing other, related works (e.g. World of Ice &amp; Fire, Dunk and Egg, and Fire &amp; Blood [which is just the first of two volumes from what I understand]) and developing TV shows. To me, it seems that Martin has simply lost interest in competing the series. I think there is a possibility that he doesn&#39;t intend to finish the last two books, but will not say so for two reasons: 1) his publisher would throw a fit, and possibly take legal action if they paid him anything in advance, and 2) the fandom would chase him down with pitchforks.</p>\n\n<p>Do you think this is possible?
