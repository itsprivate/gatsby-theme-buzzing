The 14th book in the series is just about to be released and I highly recommend the series, it gets a lot darker and smarter after the first 3 or 4 books.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway. He also wrote this YA horror/fantasy trilogy and OH MY GOD. It is so much creepier than anything I&#39;ve ever read by Stephen King or any other horror writer. The trilogy is called <em>Demon Road</em> and it&#39;s about a girl who goes on the run after she discovers her parents are demons who need to kill and eat her in order to uphold their end of a bargain with a  demon. It&#39;s smart, it&#39;s witty, it&#39;s scary and it has a ticking clock element as well as demons. I just think it&#39;s a piece of art and I love it and if anyone was looking for a recommendation this is my contribution</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l9bg0i/an_underrated_trilogy_written_by_an_underrated/","title":"an underrated trilogy written by an underrated author","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"January 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-31T15:40:44.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-31 15:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"06a32d14-d31a-5dce-8096-afb15d7db52d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l9bg0i/an_underrated_trilogy_written_by_an_underrated/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l9bg0i/an_underrated_trilogy_written_by_an_underrated/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"mommyissuesaquarius","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mommyissuesaquarius","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"mommyissuesaquarius","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"被低估的三部曲","the_new_excerpt":"我最喜欢的作家是德里克-兰蒂，他是爱尔兰人，而且他很搞笑。\n开始与儿童的幻想系列名为Skulduggery Pleasant，我\n该系列的第14本书即将出版，我9岁的时候就读过了。\n我强烈推荐这个系列，它变得更加黑暗和... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"被低估的三部曲","the_new_excerpt":"我最喜歡的作家是德里克-蘭蒂，他是愛爾蘭人，而且他很搞笑。\n開始與兒童的幻想系列名爲Skulduggery Pleasant，我\n該系列的第14本書即將出版，我9歲的時候就讀過了。\n我強烈推薦這個系列，它變得更加黑暗和... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-c84e400a-b40b-54cf-b3ac-ff239a07b113","excerpt":"As I delve deeper and deeper into the literary world, I've been fining an\noverwhelmingly popular consensus that if novels do not have likeable characters\npeople can \"connect\" with, the reading experience is thus unenjoyable.\n\nI would like to challenge this notion.
