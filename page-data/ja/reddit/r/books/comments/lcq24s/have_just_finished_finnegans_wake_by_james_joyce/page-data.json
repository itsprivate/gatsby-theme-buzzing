With reading 628 pages of core texts I&#39;ve read 1700-2000 pages of side materials. And all I can give you here is small tips of all kinds:<br/>\n- Joyce by Ellmann is THE only obligatory side book here. Helped me so much.<br/>\n- I prefer Campbell as &quot;key&quot; book for FW to Bishop Book of Darkness. I don&#39;t like many of Skeleton Keys thoughts but still in many places I thought it was nearly great.<br/>\n- Use finwake.com<br/>\n- Oxfords edition is the perfect one for reading, Vikings Hardback (with all authors notes embodied) is the perfect one for collection.<br/>\n- It has plot and there is no gibberish at all in it.<br/>\n- Just tackle through first 4 chapters.<br/>\n-  Don&#39;t try translated variants (Eng is not my 1st language but still DON&#39;T). As an example- Joyce was controling french translation of FW and he really prefered books sense being totally changed in favor of keeping its flow musical.<br/>\n- The book is very funny and positive.<br/>\n- Last 10 pages of the book are the greatest  in literature.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lcq24s/have_just_finished_finnegans_wake_by_james_joyce/","title":"Have just finished Finnegans Wake by James Joyce.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T07:28:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 07:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"dd3a7e1c-c5f4-574d-9402-a7cdd227323f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lcq24s/have_just_finished_finnegans_wake_by_james_joyce/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lcq24s/have_just_finished_finnegans_wake_by_james_joyce/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"ADM_Kronos","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ADM_Kronos","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ADM_Kronos","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"刚看完詹姆斯-乔伊斯的《芬尼根醒》。","the_new_excerpt":"我靠，我花了7个月，花了这么多时间。随着阅读628页的核心\n文本我看了1700-2000页的副资料。而我在这里能给你的只有\n是各种小技巧。\n- Joyce by Ellmann is THE only obligatory side book here. 乔伊斯的书是这里唯一的一本必读书。对我帮助很大。\n- 我更喜欢坎贝尔这个 \"关键 \"书...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"剛看完詹姆斯-喬伊斯的《芬尼根醒》。","the_new_excerpt":"我靠，我花了7個月，花了這麼多時間。隨着閱讀628頁的核心\n文本我看了1700-2000頁的副資料。而我在這裏能給你的只有\n是各種小技巧。\n- Joyce by Ellmann is THE only obligatory side book here. 喬伊斯的書是這裏唯一的一本必讀書。對我幫助很大。\n- 我更喜歡坎貝爾這個 \"關鍵 \"書...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-79ae6637-196c-543e-8d15-5cfd47efe625","excerpt":"I finished this book as I sat at the car dealership and I found myself tearing\nup.
