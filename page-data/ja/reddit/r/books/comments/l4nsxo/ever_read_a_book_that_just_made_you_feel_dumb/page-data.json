I think that compared to the general population, I have an above-average vocabulary. But Gnomon by Nick Harkaway is making me feel illiterate. The guy&#39;s word choices are so foreign to me, and used with such frequency that if I were to look up the words in the dictionary, I might as well just read the dictionary. In addition to the frequent unknown-to-me words, he&#39;ll sometimes string together a quarter page sentence that just leaves me bewildered. &quot;What the hell did I just read?&quot; I will add, though, that I am thoroughly enjoying this book. The concept, the story telling, and the characters are all fantastic and my mind gets blown with every turn of the page. I&#39;m just going to have to re-read the entire thing again to catch everything.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l4nsxo/ever_read_a_book_that_just_made_you_feel_dumb/","title":"Ever read a book that just made you feel dumb?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T05:05:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 05:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"8a098371-0b14-5dfb-a3b9-d5f99e312a25","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l4nsxo/ever_read_a_book_that_just_made_you_feel_dumb/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l4nsxo/ever_read_a_book_that_just_made_you_feel_dumb/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Thedrumdoctor","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Thedrumdoctor","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Thedrumdoctor","score":206,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"有没有看过一本让你觉得很蠢的书？","the_new_excerpt":"我先说一句，我觉得我的书读得很好。我认为\n与一般人相比，我的词汇量高于平均水平。但是\n尼克-哈卡威的《侏儒》让我觉得自己是个文盲。这家伙的文字选择是\n对我来说太陌生了，而且使用频率很高，如果我... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有沒有看過一本讓你覺得很蠢的書？","the_new_excerpt":"我先說一句，我覺得我的書讀得很好。我認爲\n與一般人相比，我的詞彙量高於平均水平。但是\n尼克-哈卡威的《侏儒》讓我覺得自己是個文盲。這傢伙的文字選擇是\n對我來說太陌生了，而且使用頻率很高，如果我... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-1b3adf6b-3030-5020-87db-7a1e602017c1","excerpt":"I ask because I read And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie when I was in\nhigh school, but I skipped the epilogue because I guess I thought it was boring?\nAnyway, for years I always assumed that the last character alive had been the\nmurderer -
