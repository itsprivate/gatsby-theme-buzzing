Card&#39;s pose was difficult to follow at first, and while Ender is a fascinating character, he isn&#39;t exactly charming in the first few pages. Plus, I had heard and seen things that I don&#39;t exactly agree with come out of Card&#39;s mouth. So I read it slowly and wasn&#39;t really sure if I should continue. I even thought it was pretty bad at some points. </p>\n\n<p>Oh boy was I wrong. </p>\n\n<p>Once the book gets rolling, it became easily one of the best books I&#39;ve ever read. Everything from the characters getting going, to Valentine and Peter, Ender&#39;s psyche and the twist. That twist. Jesus. </p>\n\n<p>All in all, absolutely everyone should read Ender&#39;s Game. I hope to give my son this same copy in thirty or so years.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ly6epy/enders_game_blew_me_away/","title":"Ender's Game blew me away","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-05T12:58:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-05 12:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3e4ab130-068a-5c7c-8c2a-cde62b06e83c","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ly6epy/enders_game_blew_me_away/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ly6epy/enders_game_blew_me_away/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"the_homework-maker","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/the_homework-maker","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"the_homework-maker","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"《安德的游戏》让我大吃一惊","the_new_excerpt":"几天前，我父亲给了我一本他85年在读的《安德的游戏》。\n我的年龄（15岁），叫我读。\n\n一开始，我很不情愿。卡的姿势一开始很难跟上。\n虽然埃德尔是一个迷人的角色，他并不完全迷人的在\n前几页。另外，我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"《安德的遊戲》讓我大喫一驚","the_new_excerpt":"幾天前，我父親給了我一本他85年在讀的《安德的遊戲》。\n我的年齡（15歲），叫我讀。\n\n一開始，我很不情願。卡的姿勢一開始很難跟上。\n雖然埃德爾是一個迷人的角色，他並不完全迷人的在\n前幾頁。另外，我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e2ee0a25-41b8-517d-aa39-d8f740634ecd","excerpt":"Has there ever been a book that proved you wrong, and made you rethink your\nstance on an entire genre?","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/lxzx47/books_you_love_in_a_genre_you_hate/","title":"Books you LOVE in a genre you HATE?","date":"March 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你喜欢的书在你讨厌的类型？","the_new_excerpt":"有没有一本书证明你是错的，让你重新思考你的。\n对整个流派的立场？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你喜歡的書在你討厭的類型？","the_new_excerpt":"有沒有一本書證明你是錯的，讓你重新思考你的。\n對整個流派的立場？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-887f7bf8-e06a-5f6b-8cd3-d623f6d73762","excerpt":"I can't remember how many times I have been asked what my preferred genre is.\nAnd sure, there are certain plots I enjoy more than others.
