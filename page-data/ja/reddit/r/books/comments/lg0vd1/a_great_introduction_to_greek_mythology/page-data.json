I (18/f) have always been interested in the idea of learning about the Greek myths, but never really knew where to start. Most books on the topic seemed a bit daunting, but I believe that Fry has provided a perfect first read. No prior knowledge or understanding was required to appreciate the myths and to enjoy not only the stories but his light hearted, humorous writing style. I would truly recommend this book to anyone who wants to take their first step into the world of Greek myths.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lg0vd1/a_great_introduction_to_greek_mythology/","title":"A great introduction to Greek mythology","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T13:07:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 13:07","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b8a39ae2-c5ae-5269-9939-bedb4d5b9d2b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lg0vd1/a_great_introduction_to_greek_mythology/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lg0vd1/a_great_introduction_to_greek_mythology/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"anna-hardacre","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/anna-hardacre","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"anna-hardacre","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"希腊神话的伟大介绍","the_new_excerpt":"昨天我读完了斯蒂芬-弗莱的《神话》。我（18/f）一直是\n对学习希腊神话的想法很感兴趣，但从来没有真正了解过\n从哪里开始。大多数关于这个主题的书籍似乎有点令人望而生畏，但我相信。\n弗莱提供了一个完美的初读。没有事先的知识或...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"希臘神話的偉大介紹","the_new_excerpt":"昨天我讀完了斯蒂芬-弗萊的《神話》。我（18/f）一直是\n對學習希臘神話的想法很感興趣，但從來沒有真正瞭解過\n從哪裏開始。大多數關於這個主題的書籍似乎有點令人望而生畏，但我相信。\n弗萊提供了一個完美的初讀。沒有事先的知識或...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e874ae96-40e7-556a-b039-2bd6e57e234e","excerpt":"Give me a recommendation for your favorite book, the \"best\" book you’ve ever\nread (whatever that means to you), or the most essential read you’ve ever come\nacross.\n\nAny genre, fiction or nonfiction, anything goes.","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/lfnjpm/hit_me_with_your_best_shot/","title":"Hit me with your best shot","date":"February 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"给我打出你的最好成绩","the_new_excerpt":"给我推荐一本你最喜欢的书，你看过的 \"最好 \"的书。\n阅读（无论对你意味着什么），或者是你曾经读过的最重要的书。\n跨。\n\n任何类型，小说或非小说，什么都可以。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"給我打出你的最好成績","the_new_excerpt":"給我推薦一本你最喜歡的書，你看過的 \"最好 \"的書。\n閱讀（無論對你意味着什麼），或者是你曾經讀過的最重要的書。\n跨。\n\n任何類型，小說或非小說，什麼都可以。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-583c6b33-076b-54e0-967e-c32df2256424","excerpt":"I just finished The Book Thief and it might rank in my top 10 books.
