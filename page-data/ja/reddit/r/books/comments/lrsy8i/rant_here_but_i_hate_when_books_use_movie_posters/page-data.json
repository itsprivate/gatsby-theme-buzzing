I love beautiful cover art on books and I hate to say I do judge a book by its cover. There&#39;s this book I want its a Swedish horror novel and every single copy I can find the cover is a still from the movie adaption. I hate being this picky but when I know the original cover art for the book is nice I don&#39;t want a film poster on it. I almost don&#39;t even want to get the book. I&#39;ve seen this trend happen with a lot books that turned into movies and frankly I don&#39;t care that it&#39;s a movie. I&#39;m here for the book! I don&#39;t want to see the movie cover I want to see the original book cover. I love how unique book cover art can be and I feel like slapping the movie poster on every new copy does the book a slight disservice. I know im sounding like a cover snob and  I know there&#39;s more to books than the book cover but I cant help but being annoyed when it&#39;s all I can find for new copies.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: on a happier note here&#39;s some of my favorite book covers.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/E7wg3kM\">http://imgur.com/a/E7wg3kM</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit edit: I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t realize this was such an overused topic on the sub. I have only been a member on this sub for a few months so I didn&#39;t know. Was just a little rant and don&#39;t have any reader friends irl to share it with so I came here instead.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lrsy8i/rant_here_but_i_hate_when_books_use_movie_posters/","title":"Rant here but I hate when books use movie posters as their cover art.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-25T03:31:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-25 03:31","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"37a61949-f282-5d21-a631-85ce9ee5cfd3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lrsy8i/rant_here_but_i_hate_when_books_use_movie_posters/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lrsy8i/rant_here_but_i_hate_when_books_use_movie_posters/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/EdginK4p6N5glR3zaZF1g20SjkpJYwdOdcXk0i-RayY.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5fa4459c9c00cdda11de84100af6f287bdc5cbee","video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"throwawaytehee","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/throwawaytehee","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"throwawaytehee","score":1411,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"在这里发发牢骚，但我讨厌书籍使用电影海报作为封面艺术。","the_new_excerpt":"这是我最讨厌的事情之一。我喜欢书上漂亮的封面艺术，我\n我不想说我以貌取人 有这本书，我想它的一个\n瑞典的恐怖小说，每一本我都能找到封面是一个静态的。\n电影改编。我讨厌这么挑剔，但当我知道... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在這裏發發牢騷，但我討厭書籍使用電影海報作爲封面藝術。","the_new_excerpt":"這是我最討厭的事情之一。我喜歡書上漂亮的封面藝術，我\n我不想說我以貌取人 有這本書，我想它的一個\n瑞典的恐怖小說，每一本我都能找到封面是一個靜態的。\n電影改編。我討厭這麼挑剔，但當我知道... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-7e93312a-46a0-54a7-8c8d-48c51a387199","excerpt":"So, I used to read YA books all the time and now all of a sudden it’s incredibly\nhard for me to focus on them and relate to the characters.
