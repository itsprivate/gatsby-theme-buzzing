As the saying goes &quot;don&#39;t judge a book by its cover&quot;, be we end (or at least I do) up judging a cover by its book, blaming it for making us buy a book we don&#39;t like. But the artist is just doing its job and doing it well, and we (I) often don&#39;t recognise it. </p>\n\n<p>My new resolution is to sometime buy books based only on the cover in recognition of the artist efforts, they deserve it. I don&#39;t know if they get a share based on the copies sold, but anyway its marketing done right and they should be proud.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s your take on this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lkbxm7/judging_a_book_by_its_cover_is_not_so_bad/","title":"Judging a book by its cover is not so bad","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-15T15:47:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-15 15:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"94bac6ef-4da5-520e-b83e-d99e1e1b9059","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lkbxm7/judging_a_book_by_its_cover_is_not_so_bad/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lkbxm7/judging_a_book_by_its_cover_is_not_so_bad/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"A_Moon_Witch","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/A_Moon_Witch","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"A_Moon_Witch","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"书到用时方恨少","the_new_excerpt":"昨天我重读了我小时候最喜欢的一本书，结果是\n发现我小时候读过的很多书都有同样的封面\n艺术家/插画师（此时我快要哭了）。\n\n这让我意识到，买书只看封面也不错。正如\n俗话说","locale":"zh"},{"title":"書到用時方恨少","the_new_excerpt":"昨天我重讀了我小時候最喜歡的一本書，結果是\n發現我小時候讀過的很多書都有同樣的封面\n藝術家/插畫師（此時我快要哭了）。\n\n這讓我意識到，買書只看封面也不錯。正如\n俗話說","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-94886fa4-ec2a-5e69-b04d-5b5d2233f03e","excerpt":"Hey everyone,\n\nas the title says, I just finished reading the count of monte christo from\ndumas.
