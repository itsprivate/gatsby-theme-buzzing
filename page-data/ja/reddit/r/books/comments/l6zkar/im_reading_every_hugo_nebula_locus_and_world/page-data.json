The attention to detail is astonishing, the writing is crisp, the characters are complex. Locales have their own personalities, the world is fleshed out, side characters and side stories are both brilliant. It&#39;s an intricate and well crafted work. On the other hand, to quote one of the characters: &quot;...You talk about it to me as someone else might talk about the weather.&quot; Can be dry and a bit of a slog; some of the side stories, while interesting, feel forced into the broader narrative. Books do not stand on their own at all as individual stories. In terms of quality, I would probably say: 3, 2, 4, 1. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dontforgettoreadabook.blogspot.com/2020/08/the-book-of-new-sun-by-gene-wolfe.html\">Full Review</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Lord Valentine&#39;s Castle by Robert Silverberg&#39;s</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plot:</strong> An amnesiac wanderer goes on an epic quest to reclaim his identity. </li>\n<li><strong>Page Count:</strong> 506</li>\n<li><strong>Award:</strong> 1981 Locus</li>\n<li><strong>Worth a read</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Primary Driver:</strong> <strong>World</strong>, <strong>Character</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Bechdel Test</strong>: Pass</li>\n<li><strong>Technobabble:</strong> Minimal.</li>\n<li><strong>Review:</strong> Despite it&#39;s sluggish pace and constant meanders there is something absolutely engrossing about this book.

Excellent use of power crawl and believable evolution of Valentine from passive to active protagonist.

Interesting applications of paradoxes, time loops, determinism, and everything else that fits in a good time-based story. That said, it&#39;s unbelievably slow. The majority of drama and action is about academic clashes, but I was somehow invested nonetheless. Some excellent character work; this does not apply to the women, who are all philandering, repressed, nymphomaniac arm-candy for the men involved.

Tiamat itself feels solidly fantasy; the ageless Snow Queen, The Lady who gives some people visions and helps them, the separate regimes of Summer and Winter. Yet it is but one planet - and the rest are technologically developed. It&#39;s a remarkable balance that works surprisingly well. Side characters are great; distinct justifications, backstories, history together. Protagonists are... fine. The driving motivation being, once again, cousins in love... not great. They&#39;re also quite passive, which gets tiresome. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dontforgettoreadabook.blogspot.com/2020/09/the-snow-queen-by-joan-d-vinge.html\">Full Review</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Many-Colored Land by Julian May</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plot:</strong> There&#39;s a portal that goes back six million years into the past and it only gets wackier from there.</li>\n<li><strong>Page Count:</strong> 433</li>\n<li><strong>Award:</strong> 1982 Locus</li>\n<li><strong>Worth a read</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Primary Driver:</strong> <strong>World</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Bechdel Test</strong>: Pass</li>\n<li><strong>Technobabble:</strong> Moderate.</li>\n<li><strong>Review:</strong> This book is delightful. The premise is ridiculous, the explanations of &quot;science&quot; to explain what happened are pretty much nonexistent... but it&#39;s just so fun. Every opportunity where this book could go off the rails it does so. The characters are fun, though shallow. This book is what happens when you throw a sack of different world-building related nouns into a blender and say, &quot;Sure!&quot; Are the rules consistent? Yes, in that there are none. I was regularly surprised by things to the point where I was laughing out loud. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dontforgettoreadabook.blogspot.com/2020/09/the-many-colored-land-by-julian-may.html\">Full Review</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>No Enemy But Time by</strong> <strong>Michael Bishop</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plot:</strong> If you think hard enough, you get to the past! </li>\n<li><strong>Page Count:</strong> 397</li>\n<li><strong>Award:</strong> 1982 Nebula</li>\n<li><strong>Worth a read</strong>: This is one of the worst books I&#39;ve ever read.</li>\n<li><strong>Primary Driver:</strong> <strong>World</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Bechdel Test</strong>: Fail(?)</li>\n<li><strong>Technobabble:</strong> Moderate.</li>\n<li><strong>Review:</strong> Look, he uses his chance to go back in time to have sex with proto-humans.

There&#39;s a key question - which race Uplifted humans? All of this is fun, and well done. It is also still at the heart of the sequel, which is a much better book. The plot of this is... fine. Characters are bland, interactions are stilted, relationships unbelievable. This isn&#39;t exactly a bad book - but it has nothing on the sequel, and is not necessary reading to understand it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dontforgettoreadabook.blogspot.com/2020/11/sundiver-by-david-brin.html\">Full Review</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Startide Rising by David Brin</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plot:</strong> Things quickly get out of hand when a ship crewed by humans, dolphins, and a chimp stumble upon a massive armada of abandoned spaceships, escalating to galactic-level drama.</li>\n<li><strong>Page Count:</strong> 498</li>\n<li><strong>Award:</strong> 1984 Hugo, 1984 Nebula, 1984 Locus SF </li>\n<li><strong>Worth a read</strong>: All aboard the hype train!

It&#39;s not a perfect book - characters can be hard to keep track of, relationships can be forced, some parts drag, and the machina has a whole bunch of deus. But there are so many good ideas in here. Uplift is brought to the fore: that a species needs another to bring it to the galactic scene. But what does that mean? How do we recreate other species in our own image? What debts do we owe each other? What if attempts to help a species fail? It&#39;s pure delightful science fiction - a masterpiece of speculation and technology and species and politics.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dontforgettoreadabook.blogspot.com/2020/11/startide-rising-by-david-brin.html\">Full Review</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Uplift War by David Brin</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plot:</strong> It&#39;s all-out war pitting the Earthlings (both human and chimp) and their allies against the Gubru, a race of birdlike aliens... with no sense of humor.</li>\n<li><strong>Page Count:</strong> 638</li>\n<li><strong>Award:</strong> 1988 Hugo, 1988 Locus SF </li>\n<li><strong>Worth a read</strong>: Yes</li>\n<li><strong>Primary Driver:</strong> <strong>Plot, World, or Character</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Bechdel Test</strong>: Pass</li>\n<li><strong>Technobabble:</strong> Moderate.</li>\n<li><strong>Review:</strong> Everything that makes the concept of Uplift delightful is still here. This is a good follow up to <em>Startide Rising</em> - but not a necessary one. Quality of writing is better, but pacing fluctuates, an overwhelming cast of characters can be hard to track, and deuses jump out of machinas frequently. This does add more depth to the mechanics of Uplift, but not to the broader ideas that made <em>Startide Rising</em> so cool.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dontforgettoreadabook.blogspot.com/2021/01/the-uplift-war-by-david-brin.html\">Full Review</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Nifft the Lean by Michael Shea</strong><em>.\\</em>*</p>\n\n<p><em>\\</em>The Incompleat Nifft,* which is the original and it&#39;s sequel.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plot:</strong> Nifft is a brilliant thief and an accomplished grifter.

A number of shorter tales linked together throw Nifft all over the globe - and to hell and back - allowing the reader to see all sorts of different things. Pacing is quick, humor lands well. Character tropes are used to good effect, allowing quick &#39;n&#39; dirty introductions to lots of different players. That said, there are a number of truly engaging characters and surprising twists. It&#39;s a light, quick, and delightful read.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dontforgettoreadabook.blogspot.com/2021/01/nifft-lean-by-michael-shea.html\">Full Review</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Little, Big by John Crowley</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plot:</strong> A multigenerational family drama mixed with a healthy dose of magical realism. </li>\n<li><strong>Page Count:</strong> 627</li>\n<li><strong>Award:</strong> 1982 World Fantasy Award</li>\n<li><strong>Worth a read</strong>: No</li>\n<li><strong>Primary Driver:</strong> <strong>World</strong>, <strong>Character</strong> [Charitably]</li>\n<li><strong>Bechdel Test</strong>: Pass</li>\n<li><strong>Technobabble:</strong> Moderate Fantasy Babble.</li>\n<li><strong>Review:</strong> I loathed this book. Pacing could be charitably described as dreamy - but more aptly as between lethargic and catatonic. Characters are as plentiful as they are unimaginative and disposable. Plot is not really a feature: all of the standbys for family drama are here, from &quot;You&#39;re Not the Father!&quot; through &quot;A Surprise Same-Sex Encounter?!&quot; with a bit of &quot;But She&#39;s My Sister!&quot; thrown in for good measure. Quality of writing is decent, but some striking phrasing and evocative images are nowhere near enough to redeem this one.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dontforgettoreadabook.blogspot.com/2021/01/little-big-by-john-crowley.html\">Full Review</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Downbelow Station by C.

It&#39;s an epic space opera with emphasis on the opera portion (for length and pacing, that is). A hefty cast of forgettable and interchangeable characters existing in a generic SF setting coupled with truly glacial pacing made this an absolute chore to read. Even scenes that should be exciting manage to be completely bland due to style choices. A smattering of neat ideas (clever uses of mind wipes in particular) are nowhere near enough to redeem this dud.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dontforgettoreadabook.blogspot.com/2020/09/downbelow-station-by-c-j-cherryh.html\">Full Review</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Foundation Trilogy by Isaac Asimov</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plot:</strong> Psychohistory: The use of mathematics and psychology to predict the course of human events. </li>\n<li><strong>Page Count:</strong> </li>\n<li>- Foundation: 244</li>\n<li>- Foundation and Empire: 256</li>\n<li>- Second Foundation: 279</li>\n<li><strong>Award:</strong> Hugo for Best All-Time Series.

I did not enjoy the conclusion of this; in a universe with a number of interesting concepts, throwing in another in Act III of another book is an odd move. I hypothesize that this won because the previous three did not.

There are some really exceptional moments here, and some genuine surprises.

The haughty condescension from the author about how grounded the historical aspects are clashed with some painfully bad attempts at changing the past.

Characters have no traits that aren&#39;t explicitly stated, and, in the name of &quot;subterfuge&quot; these characteristics can change on a dime. Pacing is abysmal - switching at random from plodding discussions to sloppy action.
