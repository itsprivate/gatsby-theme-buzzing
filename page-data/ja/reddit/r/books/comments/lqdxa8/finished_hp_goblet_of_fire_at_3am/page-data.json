Again, love the art. Hate the artist. </p>\n\n<p>AND FUCK ME, the book is so different from the films. I LOVE IT. AND SHITS GETTING INTENSE MAN. \nI’m trying to read them as though I haven’t already seen the films. I’m literally so hyped to start the next one.\nI hate Fudge. With a burning passion. He was always so nice to Harry and then suddenly at the end has a change of heart... what a prick. \nI loved the ending though; it makes me angry and excited at the same time because I know what’s to come. I can’t wait for when Sirius’ name is cleared and the order is reinstated :))</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the more I read, the more I’m enjoying the series. I’m starting Order of the Phoenix tonight. Hoping to finish all of them by the end of March. Then I can finish the rest of the books I have waiting for me 😅.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lqdxa8/finished_hp_goblet_of_fire_at_3am/","title":"Finished Hp Goblet of fire at 3am","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T12:37:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 12:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"78603d28-4597-5f2b-be6c-7e65b177b02f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lqdxa8/finished_hp_goblet_of_fire_at_3am/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lqdxa8/finished_hp_goblet_of_fire_at_3am/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"IJustNeedWifi-","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/IJustNeedWifi-","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"IJustNeedWifi-","score":61,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"凌晨3点完成了Hp Goblet of fire的工作。","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在记录我第一次读哈利波特的历程。\n在这个次元里。同样，喜欢艺术。讨厌艺术家。\n\n和他妈的我，这本书是如此不同的电影。我爱它。和SHITS\n越来越激烈的男人。我想读他们，好像我还没有看到\n的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"凌晨3點完成了Hp Goblet of fire的工作。","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在記錄我第一次讀哈利波特的歷程。\n在這個次元裏。同樣，喜歡藝術。討厭藝術家。\n\n和他媽的我，這本書是如此不同的電影。我愛它。和SHITS\n越來越激烈的男人。我想讀他們，好像我還沒有看到\n的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-4a4e856f-e98f-5f98-80a2-7fe618639608","excerpt":"Well loved meaning, highlighting passages, underlining passages/words.
