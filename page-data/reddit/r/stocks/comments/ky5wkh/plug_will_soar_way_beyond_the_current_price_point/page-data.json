Musk even called it “fool cell”. But the truth of the matter is as technology advances, fuel cell has been proven to be more commercially feasible. Fuel cell isn’t just applied to niche applications anymore and is increasingly adopted in other end-markets (commercial vehicles, aerospace, robotics, etc.). In other words, TAM has become enormous. Fuel cell is argued to to be cleaner and more weight efficient and to provide more range than batteries. I’m not going to debate on this. In my opinions, both EVs and fuel cell could co-exist in the future given the world’s accelerated transition to clean energy. </p>\n\n<p>PLUG’s two groundbreaking partnerships with SK Group and Renault validated the increased fuel cell adoption around the world and only marked the beginning of the fuel cell era. PLUG already has an established base of blue chip customers such as Amazon, Walmart, DHL, and Home Depot. PLUG’s partnerships with these customers have continued to expand over time. Interesting fact is that Amazon is not only a key customer but also a shareholder. I expect more partnerships with big names to be under way. Marsh projected revenue to significantly grow to $1.2 billion by 2024 but that could be revised to be more optimistic based on growth. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of capacity, PLUG is in the process of building out its first gigafactory this year along with 5 hydrogen stations across the country by 2024. PLUG is in a nice position to continue to expand its infrastructure to scale and handle the increased demand. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of competition, there are no serious competitors that could threaten PLUG in the long run. Unlike EVs, barriers to entry for fuel cell are high due to the capital intensive nature of the business. It took PLUG many years of growing pain, let alone significant capital investments, to get to today’s position as a clear leader in fuel cell.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, I’ve become a firm believer in fuel cell and believes PLUG is ready to capitalize on the rapid growth in fuel cell applications as the next “Tesla of fuel cell”.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ky5wkh/plug_will_soar_way_beyond_the_current_price_point/","title":"PLUG 🔌 will soar way beyond the current price point this year.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-16T11:49:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-16 11:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ky5wkh","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ky5wkh/plug_will_soar_way_beyond_the_current_price_point/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ky5wkh/plug_will_soar_way_beyond_the_current_price_point/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Sensei071","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sensei071","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Sensei071","score":330,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"PLUG🔌今年将远远超过目前的价位。","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，我知道有很多人对燃料电池持怀疑态度。我就是其中之一\n自己也有好几年了。马斯克甚至称其为 \"傻瓜细胞\"。但事实的真相是\n随着技术的进步，燃料电池已被证明是更多的。\n在商业上是可行的。燃料电池不只是应用于小众...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"PLUG🔌今年將遠遠超過目前的價位。","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，我知道有很多人對燃料電池持懷疑態度。我就是其中之一\n自己也有好幾年了。馬斯克甚至稱其爲 \"傻瓜細胞\"。但事實的真相是\n隨着技術的進步，燃料電池已被證明是更多的。\n在商業上是可行的。燃料電池不只是應用於小衆...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25919235","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25919235","title":"Heap-based buffer overflow in Sudo","date":"January 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Sudo中基于堆的缓冲区溢出。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Sudo中基於堆的緩衝區溢出。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-25917927","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25917927","title":"We rendered a million web pages to find out what makes the web slow","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 27, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"我们渲染了一百万个网页，找出是什么让网络变慢的原因","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們渲染了一百萬個網頁，找出是什麼讓網絡變慢的原因","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-ky5wkh","previousId":"HnPost-25919235","nextId":"HnPost-25917927","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ky5wkh/plug_will_soar_way_beyond_the_current_price_point/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
