This is going to be long, but if you want actual DD, sit back and enjoy. NET is doing excellent, and will only continue to excel as it continues to grab market share and boom in the background. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>---</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>What is Cloudflare?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Cloudflare is going to make a leading player in next-generation computing. From their blog: <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/\">https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/</a>. Excerpt: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Imagine you’re the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  </p>\n\n<p>Page speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...  you’re going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seriously, this is cool, and it’s only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what’s going to help them into a powerhouse is this:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Over the coming months, we’ll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It’ll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we’ll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won’t just be your frontend, it’ll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Soon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare’s network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they’ll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re not a developer, you probably didn’t understand most of that, but essentially, they’re making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money. </p>\n\n<p>I can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it’s profitability... 🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>(And even if it doesn’t, and stays at 50%, it will still 🚀 but slower. Regardless, it’s going up)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>“BuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs”</p>\n\n<p>That drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren’t long. Plus it’s hardly a tank when it’s at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher </p>\n\n<p>Its earnings was good, and to those who haven’t read it, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/\">do so</a> besides relying on a stock’s immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Revenue right now is $125 million. Doesn’t sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that’s $1 billion a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion</p>\n\n<p>Yes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That’s why I’m long Jan 21 115c. </p>\n\n<p>The revenue and growth isn’t the impressive part. The margins are</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>High 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it&#39;s consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they’re going to be <strong>raking</strong> in dough</p>\n\n<p>That being said, NET isn’t profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they’ve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn’t stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there’s nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here’s why: </p>\n\n<p>- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early ‘22</p>\n\n<p>- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare’s network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that. </p>\n\n<p>- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>—-</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONS</strong></p>\n\n<p>The only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I’m a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there’s no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don’t matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare’s “Build a Better Internet” shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare’s already enormous Cloudflare network. </p>\n\n<p>This stock already got <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades\">multiple</a> analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren’t in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I’m trying to be conservative here). </p>\n\n<p>Seriously, give this a second look. I’ve been playing NET since 37. It’s a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn’t done its 30% move. I’m completely assured that it will soon</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lj1uip/dd_cloudflare_net_is_going_to_continue_its_strong/","title":"DD: Cloudflare (NET) is going to continue its strong outperformance.
