Regular people have long suspected that they don&#39;t get to play by the &quot;rules&quot; that other players in the market do.  They&#39;re angry, they remember major life changing events like the crash of 2008 and how the people responsible weren&#39;t punished, and now they&#39;re looking to fight back.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/cramer-interview-idUKN2036292620070320\">Reuters Article on the Interview</a></p>\n\n<p>&quot;What&#39;s important when you&#39;re in that hedge fund mode, is to not do anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view, that it&#39;s important to create a new view, to create a fiction.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Then you call the (Wall Street) Journal and get the bozo reporter in Research in Motion and you would feed that (rival) Palm&#39;s got a killer it&#39;s going to give away. These are all the things you must do on a day like today, and if you&#39;re not doing it, maybe you shouldn&#39;t be in the game.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>“It might cost me $15 million or $20 million to knock RIM down but it would be fabulous because it would beleaguer all the moron longs who are also keying on Research in Motion.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund ... meaning I needed (a stock) down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Who cares about the fundamentals? The great thing about the market is that it has nothing to do with the actual stocks.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>- Jim Cramer, Dec 2006</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/\">Dealbook NY Times Article on the Interview</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:%7E:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D\">Investopedia Article: Short and Distort Bear Market Stock Manipulation</a>)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#aoh=16119453107704&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Finstablog%2F11442671-gerald-klein%2F3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack\">Anatomy of a Short Attack</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l937ov/jim_cramer_gave_an_interview_in_2006_on_how_the/","title":"Jim Cramer Gave an Interview in 2006 on how the Hedge Funds Manipulate the Markets","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-31T05:57:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-31 05:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l937ov","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l937ov/jim_cramer_gave_an_interview_in_2006_on_how_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l937ov/jim_cramer_gave_an_interview_in_2006_on_how_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"givemeyourpants","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/givemeyourpants","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"givemeyourpants","score":295,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"吉姆-克拉默在2006年接受采访，讲述了对冲基金是如何操纵市场的。","the_new_excerpt":"如果人们想知道零售业中积压的愤怒的原因\n投资者在目前的市场上似乎正在上演，不要再看了。\n比2006年对Jim Cramer的采访更进一步（Jim Cramer是他的经理，他是他的朋友）。\n1987-2001年，非常自己的对冲基金）。) 普通人早已...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"吉姆-克拉默在2006年接受採訪，講述了對沖基金是如何操縱市場的。","the_new_excerpt":"如果人們想知道零售業中積壓的憤怒的原因\n投資者在目前的市場上似乎正在上演，不要再看了。\n比2006年對Jim Cramer的採訪更進一步（Jim Cramer是他的經理，他是他的朋友）。\n1987-2001年，非常自己的對沖基金）。) 普通人早已...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26067118","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26067118","title":"Rust Foundation: Hello, World","date":"February 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"锈蚀基金会。你好，世界","locale":"zh"},{"title":"鏽蝕基金會。你好，世界","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lfa7xn","excerpt":"Obviously I’m going to let my debt devalue by inflation but what should I do\nwith that money instead?\n\nNormally I would look 10+ years into the future so I wouldn’t be too worried\nabout market volatility, but since I’m expecting to cash out a large portion of\nmy portfolio next September to lump sum…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lfa7xn/now_that_my_student_loans_dont_accrue_interest/","title":"Now that my student loans don’t accrue interest for another year, what should I do with the money?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 08, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"现在我的助学贷款还有一年不计利息，我应该怎么处理这笔钱？","the_new_excerpt":"很明显，我打算让我的债务因通货膨胀而贬值，但我应该怎么做？\n用这些钱来代替？\n\n一般来说，我会把目光投向10年以上的未来，所以我不会太担心。\n关于市场波动，但由于我预计将兑现很大一部分的资金，所以我认为这是个很好的机会。\n我的投资组合明年9月一次性付清... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"現在我的助學貸款還有一年不計利息，我應該怎麼處理這筆錢？","the_new_excerpt":"很明顯，我打算讓我的債務因通貨膨脹而貶值，但我應該怎麼做？\n用這些錢來代替？\n\n一般來說，我會把目光投向10年以上的未來，所以我不會太擔心。\n關於市場波動，但由於我預計將兌現很大一部分的資金，所以我認爲這是個很好的機會。\n我的投資組合明年9月一次性付清... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l937ov","previousId":"HnPost-26067118","nextId":"RedditPost-lfa7xn","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l937ov/jim_cramer_gave_an_interview_in_2006_on_how_the/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
