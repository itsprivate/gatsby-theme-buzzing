The ppl demand answers!</p>\n\n<p>Vlad starts with PR shit, &quot;a little background, I&#39;m the ceo of RH&quot;</p>\n\n<p>EM - yea we know! go! hahahah &quot;So basically, wednesday we had unprecedented volume. load on system. These so-called Meme stocks were going viral on social media. A lot of net-buy activity&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Vlad - Thursday morning. I&#39;m sleeping. At 3:30am PT, our operations team recieves a file from the NSCC. As a clearing broker, we have to put up money to the NSCC based on factors. Eg. volatility. concentration. etc. The request was ~$3B. 10x more than typical.</p>\n\n<p>EM - &quot;That sounds like a lot more capital than usual. How did they calculate that?&quot; It&#39;s kinda opaque. One component is VAR (value at risk). Not a public formula. + a discretionary component.</p>\n\n<p>EM - what people want to know. Did something shady go down? Why did they demand so much money</p>\n\n<p>Vlad - I don&#39;t think it would be shady. It was unprecedented demand.</p>\n\n<p>EM - &quot;is anyone holding you hostage right now? Blink twice.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Vlad - Let&#39;s call up the higher ups at NSCC and see if we can work with them. Ended up lowering it to $1.4B (down from $3B). So we had to propose a plan to manage risk on those stocks. We said marking them sell only. Before market open, they said OK. deposit $700M.</p>\n\n<p>EM - sounds like this org held a gun to your head. Give us this money or else. Did you sell your clients down the river? Or did you have no choice? If you had no choice, then ppl want to know why. This is the most I&#39;ve ever liked elon musk. He&#39;s loose &amp; sharp asking Qs</p>\n\n<p>Elon - alright. I guess if you had no choice. you had no choice. That&#39;s understandable. But whoever put that gun to your head should have to answer to the public.</p>\n\n<p>Vlad - continues to waffle/bullshit. Not gonna type out his PR speak</p>\n\n<p>Elon - to what degree are you beholden to citadel. If citadel is unhappy - what happens?</p>\n\n<p>Vlad - there&#39;s a rumor that they pressured us. That&#39;s just false. This was a clearing house decision based on capital requirements. From our pov, citadel not involved.</p>\n\n<p>Elon - wouldn&#39;t they have a strong say with the NSCC? Vlad - I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t get into conspiracies</p>\n\n<p>Elon - alright... BRUH I GOT MY MONEYS WORTH Did you have fun?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l9y17p/conversation_of_elon_vs_vlad_on_clubhouse/","title":"Conversation of Elon vs Vlad on Clubhouse!","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-01T11:32:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-01 11:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l9y17p","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l9y17p/conversation_of_elon_vs_vlad_on_clubhouse/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l9y17p/conversation_of_elon_vs_vlad_on_clubhouse/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"harivel","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/harivel","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"harivel","score":120,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"埃隆与弗拉德在会所的对话!","the_new_excerpt":"埃隆-马斯克--你想听听弗拉德关于发生在他身上的真实故事吗？\nGStop？\n\n弗拉德从观众席上走出来\n\nEM - 说说看，GStop怎么了？人们要求答案！\n\nVlad开始用公共关系的狗屎， \"一个小的背景，我是RH的首席执行官\"。\n\nEM--是的，我们知道！去！哈哈哈 \"所以......。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"埃隆與弗拉德在會所的對話!","the_new_excerpt":"埃隆-馬斯克--你想聽聽弗拉德關於發生在他身上的真實故事嗎？\nGStop？\n\n弗拉德從觀衆席上走出來\n\nEM - 說說看，GStop怎麼了？人們要求答案！\n\nVlad開始用公共關係的狗屎， \"一個小的背景，我是RH的首席執行官\"。\n\nEM--是的，我們知道！去！哈哈哈 \"所以......。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lg57r6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg57r6/weed_about_to_make_me_a_millionaire_in_2021/","title":"Weed about to make me a millionaire in 2021 🌳🚀🌳🚀🌳🚀","date":"February 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Weed about to make me a millionaire in 2021 🌳🚀🌳🚀🌳🚀。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Weed about to make me a millionaire in 2021 🌳🚀🌳🚀🌳🚀。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lg1ydy","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg1ydy/the_story_of_the_apes_part_1/","title":"The Story of the Apes [Part 1]","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 09, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"人猿的故事[第1部]","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"人猿的故事[第1部]","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l9y17p","previousId":"RedditPost-lg57r6","nextId":"RedditPost-lg1ydy","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l9y17p/conversation_of_elon_vs_vlad_on_clubhouse/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
