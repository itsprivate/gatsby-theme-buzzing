Let’s see if any of the large cap stocks follow. Even if they all did with just 1% of their cash, here’s a breakdown of their cash on hand:</p>\n\n<p>Apple: $191bn \nGoogle: $136bn\nMicrosoft: $132bn\nAmazon: $84bn\nFacebook: $62bn\nTesla: $14bn</p>\n\n<p>1% of all that is $4.87bn</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin’s marketcap is currently just under $820bn at the time of this writing. So it wont make a dent but it will inspire companies, institutions, investors, and retail to adopt Bitcoin. It’s going to happen eventually sooner than we think.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lfd2rt/tesla_buys_15bn_worth_of_bitcoin_and_what_it_means/","title":"Tesla buys $1.5bn worth of Bitcoin and what it means","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-08T16:19:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-08 16:19","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lfd2rt","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lfd2rt/tesla_buys_15bn_worth_of_bitcoin_and_what_it_means/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lfd2rt/tesla_buys_15bn_worth_of_bitcoin_and_what_it_means/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"reggieoninvesting","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/reggieoninvesting","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"reggieoninvesting","score":582,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"特斯拉买入价值15亿美元的比特币，这意味着什么？","the_new_excerpt":"如果你们有谁读过ARK的 \"比特币：为机构做准备 \"部分\n投资的大思路2021年，那么你就会知道今天的新闻终究是要\n发生。这么快？可能不会，但嘿，如果有任何迹象表明，如果比特币\n将是未来的支付形式或持有任何类型的价值，这里是... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉買入價值15億美元的比特幣，這意味着什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"如果你們有誰讀過ARK的 \"比特幣：爲機構做準備 \"部分\n投資的大思路2021年，那麼你就會知道今天的新聞終究是要\n發生。這麼快？可能不會，但嘿，如果有任何跡象表明，如果比特幣\n將是未來的支付形式或持有任何類型的價值，這裏是... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-llz2i8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llz2i8/pov_hedgies_are_on_their_last_stock_and_youre_a/","title":"POV: Hedgies are on their last stock and you're a DK main💎✋","date":"February 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"POV: Hedgies are on their last stock and you're a DK main💎✋","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"POV: Hedgies are on their last stock and you're a DK main💎✋","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lmkzmd","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmkzmd/weve_come_this_far_retards_all_paper_hands_are/","title":"We’ve come this far retards, all paper hands are gone and only 💎🙌 remain here at the GME saga, keep hodling the line @GME/AMC, next stop the the moon 🚀🚀🚀.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 18, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我们已经走到了这一步弱智，所有的纸手都不见了，只有💎🙌还留在这里GME传奇，继续蹭线@GME/AMC，下一站月球🚀🚀🚀。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們已經走到了這一步弱智，所有的紙手都不見了，只有💎🙌還留在這裏GME傳奇，繼續蹭線@GME/AMC，下一站月球🚀🚀🚀。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lfd2rt","previousId":"RedditPost-llz2i8","nextId":"RedditPost-lmkzmd","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lfd2rt/tesla_buys_15bn_worth_of_bitcoin_and_what_it_means/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
