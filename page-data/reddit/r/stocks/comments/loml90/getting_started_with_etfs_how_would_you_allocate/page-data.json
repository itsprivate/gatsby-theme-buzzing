As a way to hopefully reduce my upcoming financial burden, I&#39;ve been learning more about finance and investing and retirement accounts. </p>\n\n<p>I currently have about $2000 in a Roth IRA through Fidelity and want to put that money into some good ETFs. Ideally I&#39;d like to maximize my returns via a mix of high and low risk investments, but based on my understanding, it&#39;s more beneficial for me to go for high risk because I have several decades until retirement. Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve selected 14 ETFs that have interested me and now need help deciding which to actually invest in. I understand 14 investments would lower my risk, which is why I want to simplify my portfolio to maybe 5 or more ETFs. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance! </p>\n\n<p>List of ETFs: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/OwwaCvB\">https://imgur.com/a/OwwaCvB</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/loml90/getting_started_with_etfs_how_would_you_allocate/","title":"Getting started with ETFs - how would you allocate $2000 using the following list?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-21T06:23:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-21 06:23","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"loml90","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loml90/getting_started_with_etfs_how_would_you_allocate/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loml90/getting_started_with_etfs_how_would_you_allocate/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"instaxboi","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/instaxboi","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"instaxboi","score":186,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"我今年24岁，再过几个月就要开始上牙科学校了，这意味着我将...\n我毕业后有约40万的债务（美国私立学校，fml）。作为一种方式来\n希望能减轻我即将到来的经济负担，我一直在学习更多的知识。\n理财和投资以及退休账户。\n\n我目前有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"我今年24歲，再過幾個月就要開始上牙科學校了，這意味着我將...\n我畢業後有約40萬的債務（美國私立學校，fml）。作爲一種方式來\n希望能減輕我即將到來的經濟負擔，我一直在學習更多的知識。\n理財和投資以及退休賬戶。\n\n我目前有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26318379","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26318379","title":"Dieter Rams Palettes","date":"March 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Dieter Rams调色板","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Dieter Rams調色板","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26324347","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26324347","title":"Microsoft Power-Fx: a low-code general purpose programming language","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 03, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"微软Power-Fx：一种低代码通用编程语言。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"微軟Power-Fx：一種低代碼通用編程語言。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-loml90","previousId":"HnPost-26318379","nextId":"HnPost-26324347","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/loml90/getting_started_with_etfs_how_would_you_allocate/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
