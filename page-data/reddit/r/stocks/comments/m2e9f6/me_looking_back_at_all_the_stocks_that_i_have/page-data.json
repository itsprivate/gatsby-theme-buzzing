I&#39;ve been salty about W until GRWG rose to 60&#39;s from 3. It makes my 10K gains from 22.5K look bad, most of which were from one stock.</p>\n\n<p>If you can&#39;t see the image for some reason, the stock in question are: grwg, se, tsla, W, nvax, cake, bpy. Almost all of which that I have owned for a short period or was serious considering buying but didn&#39;t do it for some reason. There&#39;s a few others stocks but these are the most notable ones. Other stocks I wanted and had were SAVE, LUV, CCL, DAL, IMAX.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the point I have is that I listened to people too much and I overthought stocks. I may have sold stocks on emotions too. I also never expected for stocks to rise so high so fast. Yes, I still made money but nowhere near as much as I could have. I had multiple opportunities and I didn&#39;t take them. Now I&#39;m stuck in a position where I don&#39;t want to buy anything because everything is crazy high.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m2e9f6/me_looking_back_at_all_the_stocks_that_i_have/","title":"Me looking back at all the stocks that I have owned a year ago","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-11T05:52:53.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-11 05:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m2e9f6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m2e9f6/me_looking_back_at_all_the_stocks_that_i_have/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m2e9f6/me_looking_back_at_all_the_stocks_that_i_have/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"73hebdhyd6h36dhld","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/73hebdhyd6h36dhld","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"73hebdhyd6h36dhld","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我回顾一年前拥有的所有股票。","the_new_excerpt":"https://imgur.com/XsDbjZm\n\n这么多机会错过了。在GRWG升到60级之前，我一直对W很不感冒。\n这让我从22.5K的10K收益看起来很糟糕，其中大部分都是来自于一个。\n股票。\n\n如果你因为某些原因看不到图片，问题股票是：grwg，se。\ntsla，W，nvax，蛋糕，......。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我回顧一年前擁有的所有股票。","the_new_excerpt":"https://imgur.com/XsDbjZm\n\n這麼多機會錯過了。在GRWG升到60級之前，我一直對W很不感冒。\n這讓我從22.5K的10K收益看起來很糟糕，其中大部分都是來自於一個。\n股票。\n\n如果你因爲某些原因看不到圖片，問題股票是：grwg，se。\ntsla，W，nvax，蛋糕，......。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m23u4x","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m23u4x/gme_trade_halting_right_now/","title":"GME trade halting right now","date":"March 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME贸易现在停止","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME貿易現在停止","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26419070","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26419070","title":"How the New York Times A/B tests their headlines","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 11, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"纽约时报》如何对他们的标题进行A/B测试？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"紐約時報》如何對他們的標題進行A/B測試？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m2e9f6","previousId":"RedditPost-m23u4x","nextId":"HnPost-26419070","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m2e9f6/me_looking_back_at_all_the_stocks_that_i_have/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
