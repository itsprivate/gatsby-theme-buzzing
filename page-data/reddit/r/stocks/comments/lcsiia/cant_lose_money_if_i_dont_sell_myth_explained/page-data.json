Many of you have come from wsb, and I am seeing multiple occasions where people have regretted the losses they took last week and have expressed a desire to learn investing fundamentals.</p>\n\n<p>That’s great! I plan to put together a “fundamentals” guide at some point, but I have not yet had the chance. In the meantime, though, I want to point out the flawed reasoning behind a common sentiment over at wsb, one that may apply to some of our newcomers:</p>\n\n<p>”Technically, if I don’t sell, I haven’t lost.”</p>\n\n<p>The point people are trying to make is that you only <em>realize</em> a loss on a position if you sell your stock. For example, if I’ve purchased a stock at, say, $400, and now that stock is down to, I don’t know, $50, then <em>technically</em> I haven’t lost anything yet because I still own the share. </p>\n\n<p>This is incorrect reasoning. To explain why, you have to consider the notion of <strong>opportunity cost</strong>, which is essentially the cost of <em>not</em> choosing an alternate option. So let’s say I have two investing options: option A and option B. Option A will pay me 12% return, option B will pay me 10% return. I went with option B. In this case, my opportunity cost is 2%, or the additional return I <em>would have</em> made by going with option A.</p>\n\n<p>If we return to our example of the $400 stock that is now trading at $50, then sure, on the one hand, we have not sold our share and so we have not realized any actual loss. But that’s not the end of the story. You also have to account for the <em>opportunity cost</em> of holding on to a $50 asset when that $50  could otherwise be reinvested. </p>\n\n<p>Say you hold your share and it stays at $50 for the remainder of the year (perhaps in the best case scenario). By holding, you not only have lost 87% thus far on the initial trade, but you’ve also cost yourself the potential gain of putting that $50 into a safe investment (like an index fund), which likely will have a modest 8% gain on the year. That 8% gain is the <em>opportunity cost</em> of holding. </p>\n\n<p>In short, no, there <strong>is</strong> a cost even when you do not sell.</p>\n\n<p>(This is not financial advice, I just want to explain a concept.)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lcsiia/cant_lose_money_if_i_dont_sell_myth_explained/","title":"“Can’t lose money if I don’t sell” myth explained","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T00:46:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 00:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lcsiia","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcsiia/cant_lose_money_if_i_dont_sell_myth_explained/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcsiia/cant_lose_money_if_i_dont_sell_myth_explained/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"worldsarmy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/worldsarmy","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"worldsarmy","score":2498,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"\"不卖就不能赔钱 \"的神话解读","the_new_excerpt":"我想欢迎过去一周加入的所有成员。其中许多人\n你来自wsb，我看到多个场合，人们有\n遗憾的是，他们在上周遭受了损失，并表示希望能够学习\n投资基本面。\n\n很好！我打算把... 我打算把一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"不賣就不能賠錢 \"的神話解讀","the_new_excerpt":"我想歡迎過去一週加入的所有成員。其中許多人\n你來自wsb，我看到多個場合，人們有\n遺憾的是，他們在上週遭受了損失，並表示希望能夠學習\n投資基本面。\n\n很好！我打算把... 我打算把一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lim9dk","excerpt":"Hello fellow retards\n\nI know these are difficult times for this sub and it’s almost impossible to post\nsomething solid which is not about the current meme stocks.\n\nInstead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my\nDD with you.
