That means the huge majority of smart money is still holding and doesn&#39;t think there&#39;s a reason to panic. When smart money panics, you have the covid crash.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, its important to understand why there is so much red recently. The main reason is the fear due to the rising 10 year old treasury yield. When we woke up this morning, it did spike in a scary way, but now its going back down sharply, we are fine: <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETNX?p=%5ETNX&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETNX?p=^TNX&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch</a></p>\n\n<p>Now, even if this stupid 10 year old treasury yield did not go down, most people would agree these fears are irrational. Check this quick interview: <a href=\"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/video/philadelphia-fed-harker-don-t-011809466.html\">https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/video/philadelphia-fed-harker-don-t-011809466.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Historically, the rates, they go down, not up. The fear of massive interest rates are irrational, and as i said earlier, its only ~7% of people who are pulling out of nasdaq, that&#39;s a small number of people who&#39;s irrationally fearful. Feds have been under their target of 2% for a LONG time, they aren&#39;t concerned about this.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Biden agreed to tighten the covid stimulus requirements. This is good news because it means its less likely to over heat the economy beyond control. And when that stimulus does get released, its hard to imagine it won&#39;t at least give a small boost to the markets.</p>\n\n<p>I also think we need to look at the bright side. Historically, most crash happens when the market overheat. Corrections like we are having right now help avoid a real full breakdown of the market, and they help buy cheaper dips.</p>\n\n<p>I also think there is a decent chance our buddy JPow props up the market today with his speech ;)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lxnzms/stop_panicking_its_going_to_be_ok/","title":"Stop panicking, its going to be ok","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-04T19:31:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-04 19:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lxnzms","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lxnzms/stop_panicking_its_going_to_be_ok/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lxnzms/stop_panicking_its_going_to_be_ok/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Floofyboy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Floofyboy","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Floofyboy","score":129,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"不要惊慌，一切都会好起来的","the_new_excerpt":"首先，你仔细想想，纳斯达克一个月只跌了7%。那\n意味着绝大部分聪明的资金还在持有，不认为\n有一个理由恐慌。当聪明的资金恐慌的时候，你就会有covid崩溃。\n\n其次，重要的是要明白为什么有这么多的红色... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不要驚慌，一切都會好起來的","the_new_excerpt":"首先，你仔細想想，納斯達克一個月只跌了7%。那\n意味着絕大部分聰明的資金還在持有，不認爲\n有一個理由恐慌。當聰明的資金恐慌的時候，你就會有covid崩潰。\n\n其次，重要的是要明白爲什麼有這麼多的紅色... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m5gx22","excerpt":"These daily discussions run from Monday to Friday including during our themed\nposts.\n\nSome helpful links:\n\n * Finviz [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amd] for charts, fundamentals, and\n   aggregated news on individual stocks\n * Bloomberg market news [https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n   *…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m5gx22/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_mar_15_2021/","title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Monday - Mar 15, 2021","date":"March 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"r/股票每日讨论 星期一--2021年3月15日","the_new_excerpt":"每天的讨论从周一到周五，包括在我们的主题讨论期间，我们都会进行。\n岗位。\n\n一些有用的链接。\n\n * Finviz[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amd]，提供图表、基本要素和\n   个股汇总\n * 彭博市场新闻[https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n   *…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"r/股票每日討論 星期一--2021年3月15日","the_new_excerpt":"每天的討論從週一到週五，包括在我們的主題討論期間，我們都會進行。\n崗位。\n\n一些有用的鏈接。\n\n * Finviz[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amd]，提供圖表、基本要素和\n   個股彙總\n * 彭博市場新聞[https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n   *…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m5mc4h","excerpt":"Hey you wonderful apes.
