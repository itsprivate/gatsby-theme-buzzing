I already mentioned this here, but there are probably hedge funds who haven&#39;t shorted Gamestop who gauged the insane market sentiment of retail investors. So they rode the BB/AMC/NOK/GME wave, and then pulled out leaving retail as the bag holders.</p>\n\n<p>But unlike AMC, NOK and GME, BB finally broke out of the correlation, and traded upward today. Which is a good sign and maybe due to the common sentiment that it&#39;s very undervalued and potentially has a very bright future with the IoT and EV market.</p>\n\n<p>Fidelity Research gives it an average analyst score rating of 8.9/10 (9-10 is in the very bullish range), with the most notable analyst being Zacks Ranking. Seeking Alpha seems to place it at a fair value price of around $15-17. It&#39;s now around $12. Let&#39;s see how this plays out.</p>\n\n<p>My current cost basis is $15.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lcqduf/bb_is_the_only_one_that_broke_its_correlation/","title":"BB is the only one that broke its correlation with the other \"BANG\" stocks (AMC, Nokia, Gamestop) and traded upward today.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-04T23:24:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-04 23:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lcqduf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcqduf/bb_is_the_only_one_that_broke_its_correlation/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcqduf/bb_is_the_only_one_that_broke_its_correlation/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Okmanl","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Okmanl","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Okmanl","score":7010,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"BB是唯一一个打破与其他 \"BANG \"股（AMC、诺基亚、Gamestop）的相关性，今天向上交易的股票。","the_new_excerpt":"老实说，我不认为其市场操纵行为像WSB所说的那样（即空头）。\n梯子攻击）。) 我在这里已经提到了，但可能有对冲的\n没有做空Gamestop的基金，他们估摸着疯狂的市场情绪，他们是谁？\n散户投资者。所以他们乘着BB/AMC/NOK/GME的浪潮，然后... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"BB是唯一一個打破與其他 \"BANG \"股（AMC、諾基亞、Gamestop）的相關性，今天向上交易的股票。","the_new_excerpt":"老實說，我不認爲其市場操縱行爲像WSB所說的那樣（即空頭）。\n梯子攻擊）。) 我在這裏已經提到了，但可能有對沖的\n沒有做空Gamestop的基金，他們估摸着瘋狂的市場情緒，他們是誰？\n散戶投資者。所以他們乘着BB/AMC/NOK/GME的浪潮，然後... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-likajv","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/likajv/the_gme_shit_in_summary/","title":"The GME shit in summary","date":"February 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"全球环境监测系统狗屎总结","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"全球環境監測系統狗屎總結","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lipuqb","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lipuqb/meet_the_degenerates/","title":"Meet the degenerates 🥂","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 13, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"遇见堕落的人 🥂。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"遇見墮落的人 🥂。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lcqduf","previousId":"RedditPost-likajv","nextId":"RedditPost-lipuqb","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lcqduf/bb_is_the_only_one_that_broke_its_correlation/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
