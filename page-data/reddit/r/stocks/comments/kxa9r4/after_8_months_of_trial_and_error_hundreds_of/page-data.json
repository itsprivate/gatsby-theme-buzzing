I was on a steady downtrend for the first 2 months (while the general market is on a steady uptrend) and found my account balance to be below $850. I had to take a break at this point and had serious thoughts about giving up. I thought I wasn&#39;t cut out to be a trader; I must be a part of the 95% who fail.  I decided to give it one more shot. I took a deep analytical dive into my past trades. I reevaluated my strategy, and found what was working and what wasn&#39;t. I slowly started seeing results. I clawed my way back to the original $1000 investment and today have officially hit the $100 profit mark. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If anyone is still reading this, I know what you&#39;re thinking: &quot;Wow, 100 bucks, big deal,&quot; and you&#39;re right. It&#39;s not much. However, If an average guy like myself can grow his account 10%, I strongly believe that anyone can; with enough dedication. I&#39;d be happy to talk more about my journey to anyone who&#39;s interested or just starting out.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxa9r4/after_8_months_of_trial_and_error_hundreds_of/","title":"After 8 months of trial and error, hundreds of hours of Youtube, losing money, almost giving up, I can finally say I made my first $100 trading stocks","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-14T18:36:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-14 18:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kxa9r4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxa9r4/after_8_months_of_trial_and_error_hundreds_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxa9r4/after_8_months_of_trial_and_error_hundreds_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"sassysquatch11","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/sassysquatch11","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"sassysquatch11","score":6678,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"经过8个月的试错，在Youtube上看了几百个小时，赔了钱，差点放弃，我终于可以说我做了我的第一笔100美元的股票交易。","the_new_excerpt":"我开始进行纸质交易，并认为我所做的工作是有效的（看\n回想我的交易，让我现在感到恶心），所以我决定把1000美元在我的账户中\n并尝试它的真实。前2个月，我一直处于稳定的下跌趋势中（而\n大盘呈稳步上升趋势），发现我的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"經過8個月的試錯，在Youtube上看了幾百個小時，賠了錢，差點放棄，我終於可以說我做了我的第一筆100美元的股票交易。","the_new_excerpt":"我開始進行紙質交易，並認爲我所做的工作是有效的（看\n回想我的交易，讓我現在感到噁心），所以我決定把1000美元在我的賬戶中\n並嘗試它的真實。前2個月，我一直處於穩定的下跌趨勢中（而\n大盤呈穩步上升趨勢），發現我的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25904658","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25904658","title":"Vancouver seaplane company to resume test flights with electric plane","date":"January 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"温哥华水上飞机公司恢复电动飞机试飞","locale":"zh"},{"title":"溫哥華水上飛機公司恢復電動飛機試飛","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-25904188","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25904188","title":"A deeper dive into our May 2019 security incident","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 25, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"深入了解我国2019年5月安全事故的情况","locale":"zh"},{"title":"深入瞭解我國2019年5月安全事故的情況","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kxa9r4","previousId":"HnPost-25904658","nextId":"HnPost-25904188","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxa9r4/after_8_months_of_trial_and_error_hundreds_of/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
