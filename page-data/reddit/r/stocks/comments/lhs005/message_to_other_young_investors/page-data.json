Huge gains have been made....but also huge losses. I am in the latter group. I saved money for most of my life, and started investing during 2020 after the pandemic hit. I didn&#39;t want to trade, I wanted to just get long term investments and hold them. And that did work out pretty well. I was down red at certain points, but it was never SERIOUS drops, and I was confident that my picks were good in the long run. I wouldn&#39;t go into details about the weighting, but my portfolio essentially contained AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, SQ, NKE, ARKK, PLTR, NVDA, WMT, COST, DIS, JNJ, PG, V, and a couple other small picks that were my &quot;fun&quot; stocks - I actually had a few dozen APHA shares at $6. I had heavy tech weighting, but I was confident in the long term prospects. </p>\n\n<p>By this year, just about everything was in the green, and collectively up around 15%. Then came BB. BB looked appealing so I sold most of my stocks that had been moving sideways for a while (AMZN, MSFT, NVDA) and put the money into BB when it was low teens. Within a couple days, it hit the 20s and I sold for thousands in profit. The fact that I made thousands of dollars by doing nothing was crazy to me. The rest of my portfolio was also up several thousand dollars (overall, my profit was around $7000 at this point - a combination of the realized gains from BB and the unrealized gains from everything else). </p>\n\n<p>Then came GME. Several months ago, I neglected GME because I did not think they were a good long term investment, and so I did not buy them when they were less than $20/share. So when I saw the stock jump to 40, and 60 in the span of hours, I thought that was crazy. So what did I do? Naturally, I got FOMO when the stock was almost $400 and bought into the hype because I actually believed in what people over at another subreddit were saying. Within a week, my portfolio dropped around 80% (roughly $20,000). I thought that would be the best learning experience for me, but I bought into the weed hype this week, and have lost another few thousand dollars. All in all, I&#39;ve lost 90% of my money in the past month. I&#39;m young so I can recover, and this wasn&#39;t money I needed urgently. But my money I worked for and saved is completely gone because of my decisions. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m writing this mostly for myself because I needed a reality check for myself and don&#39;t have anyone to talk to. I can&#39;t sleep at nights, and can&#39;t really focus on anything else. I&#39;ve lost all interest in playing video games, and my grades are starting to take a hit. This is really embarrassing for me, and nobody knows I lost my money on stocks (nor do I want them to). I don&#39;t know if anyone needs to here this, but please be careful with your money, and don&#39;t invest more than you&#39;re willing to lose. Especially for young investors, we have such a long time horizon. There&#39;s no need to try and get rich quick. Conservative investing will compound over our lives.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lhs005/message_to_other_young_investors/","title":"Message to other young investors","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-11T20:25:38.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-11 20:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lhs005","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lhs005/message_to_other_young_investors/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lhs005/message_to_other_young_investors/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"presidentgertler","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/presidentgertler","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"presidentgertler","score":12245,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"给其他年轻投资者的留言","the_new_excerpt":"对于背景，我20岁。最近的市场非常刺激。涨幅巨大\n已取得....，但也有巨大的损失。我就属于后者。我存了钱\n我大半辈子，在2020年期间，在疫情发生后开始投资。I\n我不想交易，我只想得到长期... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"給其他年輕投資者的留言","the_new_excerpt":"對於背景，我20歲。最近的市場非常刺激。漲幅巨大\n已取得....，但也有巨大的損失。我就屬於後者。我存了錢\n我大半輩子，在2020年期間，在疫情發生後開始投資。I\n我不想交易，我只想得到長期... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26224719","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26224719","title":"Traitor: Linux privilege escalation made easy","date":"February 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"叛徒。Linux特权升级变得简单","locale":"zh"},{"title":"叛徒。Linux特權升級變得簡單","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lpqrfh","excerpt":"I usually keep 10% in cash in my brokerage for large drops, opportunities, or\nwhen I’m genuinely shifting a brick etc this percentage moves up and down\ndepending on market temperament, dodgey feelings and other voo doo crystal ball\nreadings etc 🔮 but right now I’m really undecided in such strange…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lpqrfh/how_much_cash_we_holding/","title":"How much cash we holding?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 22, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我们有多少现金？","the_new_excerpt":"我通常会在经纪公司保留10%的现金，以备大跌、机会或\n当我真正在搬砖的时候，这个百分比上下浮动。\n看市场气质、躲避感情等虚虚实实的水晶球\n读数等🔮，但现在我真的没有决定在这样的奇怪... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們有多少現金？","the_new_excerpt":"我通常會在經紀公司保留10%的現金，以備大跌、機會或\n當我真正在搬磚的時候，這個百分比上下浮動。\n看市場氣質、躲避感情等虛虛實實的水晶球\n讀數等🔮，但現在我真的沒有決定在這樣的奇怪... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lhs005","previousId":"HnPost-26224719","nextId":"RedditPost-lpqrfh","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lhs005/message_to_other_young_investors/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
