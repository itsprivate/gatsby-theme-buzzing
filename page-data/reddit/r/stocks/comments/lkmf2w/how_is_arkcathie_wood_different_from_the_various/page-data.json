I am 100% optimistic about the future of innovation and believe in Wood&#39;s vision, but history shows us that they will likely not keep up their meteoric returns. After crazy years with incredible returns (like 2020) is when most of the money piles in and the fund can no longer keep up its performance. I&#39;m highly debating whether to take profits and put it into a less sexy, more consistent fund like VOO or VTI, but I also still want to believe that ARK can pull it off.</p>\n\n<p>What are your guys&#39; thoughts?
