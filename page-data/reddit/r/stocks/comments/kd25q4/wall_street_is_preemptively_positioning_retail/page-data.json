I&#39;ve read so much in the news this year about the explosion of retail investing. Most of it has been overtly critical of the apparent inexperience and irresponsibility of new retail investors despite strong evidence that retail investors don&#39;t do much, if anything, in terms of actually moving the market. Meanwhile, industry insiders are effectively engaging in the same risky plays you see on WSB, just on a way larger scale that actually has implications for the market. Think the whole Softbank story earlier this year. </p>\n\n<p>I think most people agree that this market is a bubble that will eventually pop. And I feel like Wall Street, as usual, will find a scapegoat to deflect blame onto. I have a feeling this time is will be retail investors.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kd25q4/wall_street_is_preemptively_positioning_retail/","title":"Wall Street is preemptively positioning retail investors as a scapegoat for the cause of the next crash","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"December 14, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-14T20:48:16.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-14 20:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kd25q4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kd25q4/wall_street_is_preemptively_positioning_retail/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kd25q4/wall_street_is_preemptively_positioning_retail/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Adudam42","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Adudam42","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Adudam42","score":1220,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"华尔街先发制人地将散户投资者定位为下一次崩盘原因的替罪羊","the_new_excerpt":"你对这份声明有什么看法？今年我在新闻里读了很多东西\n关于散户投资的爆炸性增长。它的大部分都公开批评\n新散户投资者明显缺乏经验和不负责任，尽管\n强有力的证据表明散户投资者做得不多，如果…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"華爾街先發制人地將散戶投資者定位爲下一次崩盤原因的替罪羊","the_new_excerpt":"你對這份聲明有什麼看法？今年我在新聞裏讀了很多東西\n關於散戶投資的爆炸性增長。它的大部分都公開批評\n新散戶投資者明顯缺乏經驗和不負責任，儘管\n強有力的證據表明散戶投資者做得不多，如果…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kczed6","excerpt":"Seems like they had a successful pre-IND meeting with the FDA\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helping-ontarians-develop-skills-good-173000697.html].\n\nStill waiting for that up list to NASDAQ, do you guys think it's going to happen\nsoon?","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kczed6/mmedf_another_big_boost_today/","title":"$MMEDF Another Big Boost Today","date":"December 14, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$MMEDF今天又一次大幅提振","the_new_excerpt":"看起来他们和FDA进行了一次成功的IND前会议\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helping-ontarians-develop-skills-good-173000697.html].\n\n还在等待纳斯达克的名单，你们认为这会发生吗\n很快吗？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$MMEDF今天又一次大幅提振","the_new_excerpt":"看起來他們和FDA進行了一次成功的IND前會議\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helping-ontarians-develop-skills-good-173000697.html].\n\n還在等待納斯達克的名單，你們認爲這會發生嗎\n很快嗎？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kcw58h","excerpt":"Nio (NYSE:NIO) has priced its offering of 68M ADSs, each representing one Class\nA ordinary share at $39.00/ADS.\n\nUnderwriters' over-allotment is an additional 10.2M ADSs.\n\nNet proceeds will be used for research and development of new products and next\ngenerations of autonomous driving technologies,…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kcw58h/nio_slips_6_after_pricing_ads_offering_at_39/","title":"Nio slips 6% after pricing ADS offering at $39","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"December 15, 2020","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"NIO股价下跌6%，此前将广告定价为39美元","the_new_excerpt":"NIO(纽约证券交易所代码：NIO)已为其发行的6800万张美国存托凭证定价，每只美国存托凭证代表一个类别\n普通股，每股39美元。\n\n承销商的超额配售是额外的1020万美国存托凭证。\n\n净收益将用于新产品的研发和下一步\n一代又一代的自动驾驶技术，…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"NIO股價下跌6%，此前將廣告定價爲39美元","the_new_excerpt":"NIO(紐約證券交易所代碼：NIO)已爲其發行的6800萬張美國存託憑證定價，每隻美國存託憑證代表一個類別\n普通股，每股39美元。\n\n承銷商的超額配售是額外的1020萬美國存託憑證。\n\n淨收益將用於新產品的研發和下一步\n一代又一代的自動駕駛技術，…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kd25q4","previousId":"RedditPost-kczed6","nextId":"RedditPost-kcw58h","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kd25q4/wall_street_is_preemptively_positioning_retail/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","386998304","4203388852"]}
