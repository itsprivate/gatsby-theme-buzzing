I learned about NIO over two years ago when they were featured on 60 Minutes and was one of the first active users on <a href=\"/r/Nio\">r/Nio</a>. Back then, the stock was 10$, and I bought 500 shares. But after their IPO, they had a rough year with declining sales. Despite that, I kept buying in to eventually accumulate 3,200 shares at an average price of 3.12$.</p>\n\n<p>But then came more bad news and worse sales. People were talking about the company running out of cash and the stock going to 0$, and they did eventually hit 1.00$. I sold at 1.78$ before that happened and took my 57% loss.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve only been investing for two years, but it&#39;s my biggest regret so far. I should have never listened to some asshole at Bloomberg getting paid to write negative articles and trusted my gut. NIO is a solid company and is going to be one the leaders in the Chinese and global EV market. They completely restructured after those losses (Nio Places vs. Nio Houses, fired staff, etc.), and those 3,200 shares are worth over 150,000$ today. They&#39;ll be worth even more in the future.</p>\n\n<p>All I can do now is take this as a learning experience, but I feel like I&#39;ll never find another stock like them. Sigh ...</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Someone here contacted the Reddit Care Team. Thank you for the laugh ...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kpjmim/i_sold_nio_when_they_were_178_and_missed_out_on/","title":"I sold NIO when they were 1.78$ and missed out on their meteoric rise","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-03T15:30:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-03 15:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kpjmim","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kpjmim/i_sold_nio_when_they_were_178_and_missed_out_on/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kpjmim/i_sold_nio_when_they_were_178_and_missed_out_on/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"vacuum_potential","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/vacuum_potential","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"vacuum_potential","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我在他们1.78美元的时候卖出了NIO，错过了他们的快速上涨","the_new_excerpt":"我要为这件事自杀了。我是在两年多前了解到NIO的，当时他们\n是“60分钟”的特色节目，是r/nio上的首批活跃用户之一。\n[/r/nio]。当时，股票是10美元，我买了500股。但是在他们的\n在首次公开募股(IPO)期间，他们经历了艰难的一年，销售额不断下降。尽管如此，I…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我在他們1.78美元的時候賣出了NIO，錯過了他們的快速上漲","the_new_excerpt":"我要爲這件事自殺了。我是在兩年多前瞭解到NIO的，當時他們\n是“60分鐘”的特色節目，是r/nio上的首批活躍用戶之一。\n[/r/nio]。當時，股票是10美元，我買了500股。但是在他們的\n在首次公開募股(IPO)期間，他們經歷了艱難的一年，銷售額不斷下降。儘管如此，I…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kpj5t3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kpj5t3/the_story_of_my_life/","title":"The story of my life","date":"January 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我整个人生的故事","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我整個人生的故事","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1345716425772695552","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1345716425772695552","title":"There’s going to be hyperinflation when all the Bitcoin gets converted into dollars.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 03, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"当所有比特币都兑换成美元时，将会出现恶性通货膨胀。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"當所有比特幣都兌換成美元時，將會出現惡性通貨膨脹。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kpjmim","previousId":"RedditPost-kpj5t3","nextId":"TweetPost-1345716425772695552","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kpjmim/i_sold_nio_when_they_were_178_and_missed_out_on/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","386998304","4203388852"]}
