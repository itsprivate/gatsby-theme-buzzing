Why not restrict the trading between 08-16 or just allow everyone to purchase/sell during after hours? I live in Sweden so I invest through something called an &quot;Investeringssparkonto&quot; which you tax like 0,375% on the total value of the account and instead of 30% of the profits and we can&#39;t trade during AH with those accounts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lrz748/why_is_afterhours_trading_even_a_thing/","title":"Why is afterhours trading even a thing?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-25T11:22:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-25 11:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lrz748","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrz748/why_is_afterhours_trading_even_a_thing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrz748/why_is_afterhours_trading_even_a_thing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"pm_me_you_in_latex","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/pm_me_you_in_latex","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"pm_me_you_in_latex","score":241,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么盘后交易还能成事？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，我是新的投资生活，我只是一直在想，为什么收市后的\n交易甚至是一个东西？大多数普通投资者并没有能力来\n交易后的时间，所以我们只是坐在那里，看股票上涨或下跌和\n无力做任何事情，而机构和富人... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼盤後交易還能成事？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，我是新的投資生活，我只是一直在想，爲什麼收市後的\n交易甚至是一個東西？大多數普通投資者並沒有能力來\n交易後的時間，所以我們只是坐在那裏，看股票上漲或下跌和\n無力做任何事情，而機構和富人... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lrycl1","excerpt":"Results for the quarter\n\nParticular Q421 (In millions) Q420(In millions) % Revenue 5000 3105 61% Gross\nmargins 63.1% 64.9% Net income 1457 950 53%\n\nResults for the year\n\n\n\nParticular FY21 FY20 % Revenue 16675 10918 53% Gross Margins 65.6% 62.5% Net\nIncome 62700 3580 75%\n\n\n\nQ122 Projections\n\nRevenue…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lrycl1/nvidia_q4_earnings_release/","title":"Nvidia Q4 Earnings release","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Nvidia第四季度财报发布","the_new_excerpt":"本季度业绩\n\n第421季度(百万元) 第420季度(百万元) 收入百分比 5000 3105 61% 毛额\n利润率 63.1% 64.9% 净收入 1457 950 53%\n\n本年度的成果\n\n\n\n21财年20财年%收入16675 10918 53%毛利率65.6% 62.5%净利率\n收入 62700 3580 75%\n\n\n\n问题122预测\n\n收入...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Nvidia第四季度財報發佈","the_new_excerpt":"本季度業績\n\n第421季度(百萬元) 第420季度(百萬元) 收入百分比 5000 3105 61% 毛額\n利潤率 63.1% 64.9% 淨收入 1457 950 53%\n\n本年度的成果\n\n\n\n21財年20財年%收入16675 10918 53%毛利率65.6% 62.5%淨利率\n收入 62700 3580 75%\n\n\n\n問題122預測\n\n收入...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26259955","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26259955","title":"Common Nginx misconfigurations that leave your web server open to attack","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 25, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"常见的Nginx错误配置会让你的Web服务器受到攻击。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"常見的Nginx錯誤配置會讓你的Web服務器受到攻擊。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lrz748","previousId":"RedditPost-lrycl1","nextId":"HnPost-26259955","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lrz748/why_is_afterhours_trading_even_a_thing/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
