Obviously, the EV space in China is getting crowded and not everyone will emerge as a winner. From my perspective, I think a lot of investors are missing the key competitive advantage in the future EV race when evaluating an EV player. The most important differentiation from one EV to another isn’t its design, hardware (performance, range, safety, etc.) or even price, it’s software and in other words, tech and autonomous driving development. Whoever comes out ahead in autonomous driving will emerge as leaders in the EV space. Personally, I think Xpeng will come out on top based on its huge focus on software development and promising execution thus far:</p>\n\n<p>Xpeng markets its EVs as “smart” EVs from the get go and mainly focuses on the tech components and, most importantly, autonomous driving development. Among all Chinese EV competitors, Xpeng was the first to decide to utilize Nvidia’s platform to advance autonomous driving. Others like Li and Nio followed suit later on. Xpeng has also been constantly upgrading its autonomous driving software and its latest NGP (version 3.0) has been starting to receive more recognitions in China. </p>\n\n<p>Xpeng is heavily backed by institutional investors and CCP. 5 state-owned banks just handed Xpeng a $2 billion line of credit without Xpeng having to potentially give up equity. CCP will not let Xpeng fail. </p>\n\n<p>Within a short period of time, Xpeng will be already rolling out 3 mass market EVs including a new sedan by Q3 to Q4 this year. We all know the mass market is ultimately where most of the money comes from (Tesla did not take off until Model 3 release). Xpeng’s rapid rollout of mass market EVs is very impressive but could also result in capacity risk. However, Xpeng is already in the process of manufacturing its second plant in Guangzhou which will be operational by Q3 this year, bringing the total annual capacity to min. 200k+. Xpeng is also planning to expand manufacturing by most likely building a third plant in the near future via the new LOC from state owned banks. As a result,  Xpeng will be able to scale quickly, much quicker than Nio, and handle the demand spike without delay issues.  </p>\n\n<p>Xpeng has demonstrated to have great execution thus far. It achieved 10k deliveries milestones and positive GPM faster than any other Chinese EV competitor. Both Nio and Xpeng are backed by CCP but, unlike Nio, Xpeng never had liquidity issue and did not utilize government funding for bailout. </p>\n\n<p>If one worries about Xpeng’s potential legal problems due to allegations by Tesla against Xpeng’s employee. You shouldn’t. The investigation went on for 2 years with zero legal credibility. It has been a war of words going nowhere. See link below for the timeline of the allegations.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/insideevs.com/news/455900/xpeng-responds-elon-musk-tweet/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/insideevs.com/news/455900/xpeng-responds-elon-musk-tweet/amp/</a></p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, I’m bullish on Xpeng and overall Chinese EV market. I think Xpeng ($34.1mil market cap) is a cheap buy compared to Nio ($87.7mil market cap) right now and later on people might regret putting all the eggs in Nio’s basket.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l00y5s/lets_talk_about_xpeng/","title":"Let’s talk about Xpeng.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-19T07:40:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-19 07:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l00y5s","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l00y5s/lets_talk_about_xpeng/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l00y5s/lets_talk_about_xpeng/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Sensei071","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sensei071","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Sensei071","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我们来说说X鹏。","the_new_excerpt":"我想现在大家都认识到，中国的电动车市场的利润比\n鉴于TAM的规模和中共积极推动向TAM过渡的情况下，任何其他国家\n电动车。很显然，中国的电动车领域越来越拥挤，并不是每个人都会有\n崭露头角，成为赢家。从我的角度来看，我认为很多... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們來說說X鵬。","the_new_excerpt":"我想現在大家都認識到，中國的電動車市場的利潤比\n鑑於TAM的規模和中共積極推動向TAM過渡的情況下，任何其他國家\n電動車。很顯然，中國的電動車領域越來越擁擠，並不是每個人都會有\n嶄露頭角，成爲贏家。從我的角度來看，我認爲很多... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1354462831295557638","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1354462831295557638","title":"Virgin Galactic is up 30%. \n \n$SPCE 🚀 https://t.co/3Rxm9REtGm","date":"January 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"维珍银河上涨30%。\n \n$SPCE 🚀 https://t.co/3Rxm9REtGm","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"維珍銀河上漲30%。\n \n$SPCE 🚀 https://t.co/3Rxm9REtGm","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1354667898455937027","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1354667898455937027","title":"Apple justifies its huge valuation, while Tesla … not so much https://t.co/D7WVyyrmT2","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 28, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"苹果为其巨大的估值提供了理由，而特斯拉......则没有那么多https://t.co/D7WVyyrmT2。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"蘋果爲其巨大的估值提供了理由，而特斯拉......則沒有那麼多https://t.co/D7WVyyrmT2。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l00y5s","previousId":"TweetPost-1354462831295557638","nextId":"TweetPost-1354667898455937027","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l00y5s/lets_talk_about_xpeng/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
