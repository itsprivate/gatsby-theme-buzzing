Margin calls out the ass. Like $200k per day. If I bought back the stock (covered) I would never be able to borrow it again so I would be totally locked out. I bought the same number of shares that I was short so that I was both short and long (short against the box it is called). No matter which way the stock went I was even. When it finally peaked at $55 and started falling like a rock I sold my long side every day that I had enough margin and rode it down to $9. I made about $180k but believe me, it wasn&#39;t worth the stress.</p>\n\n<p>I am so tired of people saying that the shorts haven&#39;t covered. Or one neophyte asking &quot;What day are the shorts going to cover?&quot; I don&#39;t have a horse in this race (I day traded it last week several times) but I feel very bad for the new people getting in at the high. Especially one who said &quot;I paid my rent by credit card and used the money to buy GME&quot; That person is already under water.</p>\n\n<p>GME shorts all covered and/or boxed last week. Do you really think that you guys collectively have enough buying power to move it it from $65 to $483 with 500 million shares on your own? Time for a reality check.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lak74v/confessions_of_a_short_seller/","title":"Confessions of a short seller","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T03:37:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 03:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lak74v","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lak74v/confessions_of_a_short_seller/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lak74v/confessions_of_a_short_seller/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"bighdaddie","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bighdaddie","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"bighdaddie","score":29,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"卖空者的自白","the_new_excerpt":"你想要现实吗？我在80年代是个大空头。做空Iomega\n12元，就到了55元。保证金叫出了屁股。比如每天20万。如果我\n买回股票（覆盖），我将永远无法再借到它，所以我\n会被完全锁定。我买了同样数量的股票... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"賣空者的自白","the_new_excerpt":"你想要現實嗎？我在80年代是個大空頭。做空Iomega\n12元，就到了55元。保證金叫出了屁股。比如每天20萬。如果我\n買回股票（覆蓋），我將永遠無法再借到它，所以我\n會被完全鎖定。我買了同樣數量的股票... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26078677","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26078677","title":"Infinitely zooming botanical floral paradise painting","date":"February 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"无限放大的植物花卉天堂画作。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"無限放大的植物花卉天堂畫作。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lgdk0p","excerpt":"Any thoughts on KOPN?
