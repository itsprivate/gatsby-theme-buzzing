Started this year halfway through January. Not panicking right now, just wondering why and how this happens. Last week we saw the same thing happen where Thursday and Friday were mostly red. How does this happen and why are some days massively green, while others are massively red like last week, yesterday and if I have to believe the pre market, today as well. Is it big funds all selling at once?</p>\n\n<p>To add to this question, how often in general does this happen? I understand 2020 and 2021 so far have been insane and abnormal in terms of investing but are these red days something that has always happened on a regular basis?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Some of you seem to not understand what I&#39;m asking here. I&#39;m not asking why stocks go down in value. I realize that&#39;s because people are selling more then buying. I&#39;m asking why on some days all stocks go to red at the same time as some kind of uniform thing.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lmnqhs/can_someone_eli5_why_sometimes_the_whole_market/","title":"Can someone ELI5 why sometimes the whole market is red like today?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-18T17:42:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-18 17:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lmnqhs","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lmnqhs/can_someone_eli5_why_sometimes_the_whole_market/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lmnqhs/can_someone_eli5_why_sometimes_the_whole_market/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"pklokgieters","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/pklokgieters","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"pklokgieters","score":146,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"谁能ELI5为什么有时候整个市场像今天这样红？","the_new_excerpt":"为了弄清我的问题。\n\n我对投资很陌生。今年一月半开始。不\n现在很恐慌，只是想知道为什么会发生这种情况，如何发生。上周我们看到\n同样的事情发生在周四和周五大部分是红色的地方。这怎么\n发生，为什么有些日子大规模... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"誰能ELI5爲什麼有時候整個市場像今天這樣紅？","the_new_excerpt":"爲了弄清我的問題。\n\n我對投資很陌生。今年一月半開始。不\n現在很恐慌，只是想知道爲什麼會發生這種情況，如何發生。上週我們看到\n同樣的事情發生在週四和週五大部分是紅色的地方。這怎麼\n發生，爲什麼有些日子大規模... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-luxx2q","excerpt":"I have seen many people not buy stocks due to the price being too high or vice\nversa.
