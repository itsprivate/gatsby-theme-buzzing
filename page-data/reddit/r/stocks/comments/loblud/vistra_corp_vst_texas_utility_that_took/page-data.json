Most of their portfolio is low and no carbon emission generation, and moving in that direction long term.</p>\n\n<p>As a company, they continue to trade at undervalued prices. Regulated utilities trade at a 20.5 PE (IPP’s trade at 65.5), while VST trades at 12.8 PE. <strong>If VST traded in line with regulated utilities, it would trade at $36.69</strong> (IPP’s at $117).</p>\n\n<p>This is all before the moonshot quarter, before forwards have increased, before all of these REP’s go on liquidation sale, and before the $1.5B share repurchase (started January 2021) has taken affect.</p>\n\n<p>As a company, VST has:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>4 years of YoY Revenue growth (over 100%)</li>\n<li>4 years of YoY Earnings growth (from -$250M to $1B+ TTM)</li>\n<li>4 years of YoY EPS growth</li>\n<li>Insider buying as recent as late December 2020 (right up to the blackout period)</li>\n<li>Pending IG rating in 2021, reducing costs of debt in 2021. This week their application got a whole lot better</li>\n<li>Way undervalued vs industry in nearly every valuation metric 18% FCF, 5.5 EV to EBITDA</li>\n<li>Average analyst rating of mid 30&#39;s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The companies vision to transition to a zero carbon. Many talk about NextEra Energy as the only game in town. VST is far cheaper with a similar mission. Looking NEE’s energy breakdown by source (data from Sustainability&gt;Overview&gt;By the numbers on NEE website ), 58% of generation comes from Natural Gas +Nuclear vs 53% of VST. The difference is looking at the coal generation of 5% for NEE vs 20% EBITA for VST. If VST got rid of 15% of coal generated EBITA, and traded at NEE’s valuation, it would be $83 a share. Both NEE and VST have gas turbines that can be retrofit should hydrogen become economical. VST has the biggest battery in the world, VST is committing $500M+ in green investments annually.</p>\n\n<p>Q4 earnings are out on 2/26, so I’m looking forward to hearing the comments from last week.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/loblud/vistra_corp_vst_texas_utility_that_took/","title":"Vistra Corp (VST): Texas Utility that took Winterization Seriously","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-21T04:52:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-21 04:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"loblud","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loblud/vistra_corp_vst_texas_utility_that_took/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loblud/vistra_corp_vst_texas_utility_that_took/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"veggie-man","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/veggie-man","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"veggie-man","score":50,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"威斯特拉公司（VST）。德州认真对待过冬的公用事业","the_new_excerpt":"VST的市值为110亿美元，本周完成了历史性的一周，很有可\n在激增定价上产生了约20-40亿美元的收入，因为它似乎是唯一的德克萨斯州。\n公用事业认真对待过冬问题，几乎所有的发电量都是如此\n上周的发电量...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"威斯特拉公司（VST）。德州認真對待過冬的公用事業","the_new_excerpt":"VST的市值爲110億美元，本週完成了歷史性的一週，很有可\n在激增定價上產生了約20-40億美元的收入，因爲它似乎是唯一的德克薩斯州。\n公用事業認真對待過冬問題，幾乎所有的發電量都是如此\n上週的發電量...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26302344","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26302344","title":"Giving Ada a Chance","date":"March 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"给Ada一个机会","locale":"zh"},{"title":"給Ada一個機會","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lwk046","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwk046/update_gme_in_full_phineas_mode/","title":"UPDATE: $GME in full Phineas mode","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 03, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"更新：$GME完全进入Phineas模式。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"更新：$GME完全進入Phineas模式。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-loblud","previousId":"HnPost-26302344","nextId":"RedditPost-lwk046","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/loblud/vistra_corp_vst_texas_utility_that_took/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
