A few minutes later, it did not appear to work, so I attempted to sell again. Subsequently, my account showed that both &quot;sells&quot; went through. Then my account had the cash from both sales, and a negative balance of shares that I was required to deliver in 3 days.</p>\n\n<p>After seeing the stock price dramatically rise and my apparent liabilities increasing (without limit), I freaked out and covered the short position at a huge loss (~$180k). If I was lucky and the price went down, I could have been able to cover the short at a huge gain, and could have kept my mouth shut (not that I would have). But instead I&#39;m out a bunch of money in my retirement account that was a result of this bug, and Schwab owes me about $180k.</p>\n\n<p>Had I not covered this erroneous short position, the shorts probably would have become what we know to be &quot;Failures to Deliver&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I have attached the record of what happened below, which I sent to Schwab soon after the event, to try to get the situation undone. I eventually was able to call their support team and they said I would have to wait 30 days to resolve the situation.</p>\n\n<p>The guy on the phone said they were having lots of problems with this bug, in other equities too. I can&#39;t recall the complete conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I recently got a message in the system that I would have to wait *another* 30 days. So I flipped my shit and now I&#39;m posting about it here. Please don&#39;t comment about how retarded I am for investing my retirement in GME. That&#39;s not the story. I do what I want, I like the stock, and there is a serious problem here completely unrelated to how retarded I am, and the general public absolutely needs to know what is going on.</p>\n\n<p>I have no information about how many other naked short positions were created by Schwab. I do know that it was more than just myself, and in other equities as well, based on my conversation with their support representative. I have no information about whether or not the bug still exists. I did not test it beyond what happened. It may very well be the case that the bug is still a problem, as far as I know.</p>\n\n<p>Related: I recently posted something that made me suspicious to <a href=\"/r/stocks\">/r/stocks</a> - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/</a></p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t realize this until today, but I connected the dots between the details of this post and what happened to me in my Schwab retirement account. i.e. Schwab+TD are the same company, and these two things could be related.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the message I sent to Schwab (for a record of what happened). You might notice that it&#39;s a 401(k), which most people might note does not usually allow individual stock trading, but it is a self-managed fund, and individual stocks are actually allowed:</p>\n\n<p>------------------------------- START OF MESSAGE -----------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>To whom it may concern:</p>\n\n<p>My name is ####### #######, my account number is ####-####</p>\n\n<p>I attempted to call your 1-800 number several times, but I was unable to get through to your support. Here is a breakdown of what happened:</p>\n\n<p>There is a bug in your system that caused my non-margin account to briefly become short GME shares. My account is a non-margin 401(k) account. In good faith, I spent $430k to cover the position that my account should not have been allowed to get into. Two trades need to be undone.</p>\n\n<p>At market open, my position this morning was NNNN shares of GME.</p>\n\n<p>At 11:09, I attempted to place a market order to sell NNNN shares: Order #AAAAAAAA</p>\n\n<p>The order did not show up for about 10 minutes. My account balance still showed NNNN shares, so I attempted to make a similar order again. I placed a sell of &quot;Limit Or Better&quot; to sell NNNN shares at $125. Order #BBBBBBBB</p>\n\n<p>About 10 minutes later, I got confirmations for BOTH ORDERS, and a notice that the account was due securities. I DO NOT have a margin account, and it should not have gone short, the system should have rejected one of the orders because the shares were not in my account.</p>\n\n<p>Once I realized what the system did, I saw the short position which your system erroneously put me in, and to protect from the potential infinite uncovered losses on my account, I did a market buy at 11:44AM for NNNN shares using the &quot;Buy to Cover&quot; button, which zeroed out my position in GME. Order #CCCCCCCC</p>\n\n<p>The erroneous trade needs to be undone, and my buy to cover also needs to be undone, as both of these are not legal trades for my 401(k).</p>\n\n<p>Orders #BBBBBBBB and #CCCCCCCC should not exist on my account. #BBBBBBBB is a result of a bug in your trading system, and #CCCCCCCC  was a good faith attempt for me to prevent the issue from becoming a much bigger problem.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sending this in a timely manner so there is a record of what happened, and I will refer to it when I call again when your call volume is reduced.</p>\n\n<p>-------------------------------------------- END OF MESSAGE -------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>Disclosure: My current positions in my 401(k) are as follows, ignoring what Schwab owes me:</p>\n\n<p>GME: ~4500 shares</p>\n\n<p>Cash &amp; Money Market: ~$180k.</p>\n\n<p>Again please don&#39;t comment about the intelligence or stupidity of my investing strategies. None of this is advice. If you do anything related to what I&#39;m talking about here, you&#39;re probably stupid. I&#39;m only trying to point out a massive problem with Schwab that indicates to me a potential systemic risk in the markets (and Schwab investors).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/","title":"A bug in Schwab caused my retirement account to go naked short GME.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-20T22:40:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-20 22:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"loffqz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Fragsworth","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fragsworth","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Fragsworth","score":2362,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Schwab的一个BUG导致我的退休账户裸空GME。","the_new_excerpt":"这是一个*涉及*金交所的故事，但不是*关于金交所的故事。\n\n我在这里所描述的事件发生在1月28日，在我的现金退休金中\n帐户。\n\n简而言之，我有一些GME的股票，并使用接口立即出售它们\n在我读到Robinhood宣布禁用他们的买...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Schwab的一個BUG導致我的退休賬戶裸空GME。","the_new_excerpt":"這是一個*涉及*金交所的故事，但不是*關於金交所的故事。\n\n我在這裏所描述的事件發生在1月28日，在我的現金退休金中\n帳戶。\n\n簡而言之，我有一些GME的股票，並使用接口立即出售它們\n在我讀到Robinhood宣佈禁用他們的買...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26314900","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26314900","title":"Statistics Postdoc Tames Decades-Old Geometry Problem","date":"March 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"统计学博士后驯服几十年前的几何学问题","locale":"zh"},{"title":"統計學博士後馴服幾十年前的幾何學問題","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lvtzj4","excerpt":"There's been a lot of chatter here about PE ratios and Great Depression levels\nof overvalue.
