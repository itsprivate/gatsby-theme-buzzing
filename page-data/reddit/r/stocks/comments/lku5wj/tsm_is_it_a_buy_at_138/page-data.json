I first invested in it at $50 but since sold that position was able to re-enter and stayed with my positions at $76 and $103. With 36 shares total I am excited and hopeful this TSM with continue to rally. It even pays a 1.59% Annual Dividend but comes with a small foreign tax fee, my latest tax fee was $.19.</p>\n\n<p>They have purchased land in Arizona for $89 million to manufacture 5nm chips and they expect production can start in 2024 and the project will continue to 2029 with an estimated cost at $12 billion dollars. With expectations of 4nm and 3nm being manufactured by 2022. The P/E is slightly higher than the average with earnings just shy of the average. So your paying a premium but for the largest semiconductor manufacture with a market cap at $715B you also get an advantage in the market with a respectable stock price history, market exposure and a positive future with increasing ability to manufacture more chips in the upcoming years.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think TSM is far away from hitting the $150 and beyond. <a href=\"https://stockinvest.us/\">Stockinvest.us</a> has price projections near $200 in the next 3 months. I am not too concerned with the timeline but honestly I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it hit $150 next week. I tend to be a bit bullish on TSM and I see this chip shortage being the catalyst that can give us a strong first quarter. With the chip shortage being fueled by the high demand in the auto industry among all the new smart technology devices.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t believe investing in TSM or into any position for just 1 reason or even for somebody else&#39;s reasons is wise. It&#39;s easy to pull up the graph and see the upward trend but I am trying to focus on need for TSM products and the ways they plan on increasing production.</p>\n\n<p>How and if you choose to invest in TSM is up to you. I am long TSM and I am interested in the following as well.</p>\n\n<p>ON,MU,ASML,AMAT,LRCX</p>\n\n<p>I hope this was helpful to someone. I think it would be a good idea to at least give it a second look for those looking for Semiconductor exposure.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lku5wj/tsm_is_it_a_buy_at_138/","title":"TSM - Is it a Buy at $138?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-16T14:57:07.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-16 14:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lku5wj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lku5wj/tsm_is_it_a_buy_at_138/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lku5wj/tsm_is_it_a_buy_at_138/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"xAshraxx","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/xAshraxx","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"xAshraxx","score":50,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"$TSM--我是以平均成本102美元的价格进入的。\n由于卖出了这个头寸，能够重新进入并留在我的头寸在。\n76元和103元。共36股，我很兴奋，希望这个TSM与\n继续反弹。它甚至支付了1.59%的年度股息，但附带...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"$TSM--我是以平均成本102美元的價格進入的。\n由於賣出了這個頭寸，能夠重新進入並留在我的頭寸在。\n76元和103元。共36股，我很興奮，希望這個TSM與\n繼續反彈。它甚至支付了1.59%的年度股息，但附帶...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26274516","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26274516","title":"An interactive guide to CSS transitions","date":"February 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"CSS过渡的交互式指南","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CSS過渡的交互式指南","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lt49gl","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt49gl/theres_only_500000_shares_left_to_short_buy_and/","title":"There's only 500000 shares left to short.
