Yes, they seem to have a huge breakthrough just about to happen. Yes, they actually have an announcement or two. Yes, people have gotten excited and rushed in. But in nearly each case, the talk fizzled out and investors were left holding bags (hmm, yet to see what happens long term with NIO, but the rest still holds).</p>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;m wondering if $BB is following in these footsteps. The price jumps seem so OTT in comparison to what they&#39;ve actually announced. Nearly 100% in a week, 52 week highs, highs not seen for 2.5 years?!</p>\n\n<p>What do others think about this? Is this just irrational exuberance by the market, or Pumpers, or Robinhooders looking for the next rocket to the moon? Or, do they really have something amazing buried underneath all the hype, and if so, what is it (with numbers, not just talk)?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l1ntnm/serious_is_bb_replacing_nio_nkla_and_htzgq_as_the/","title":"[Serious] Is $BB replacing $NIO, $NKLA, and $HTZGQ as the Meme Stock of 2021?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-21T23:57:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-21 23:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l1ntnm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l1ntnm/serious_is_bb_replacing_nio_nkla_and_htzgq_as_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l1ntnm/serious_is_bb_replacing_nio_nkla_and_htzgq_as_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"djh_van","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/djh_van","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"djh_van","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"严重]巴恩斯B是否取代蔚来、$NKLA和$HTZGQ成为2021年的Meme股？","the_new_excerpt":"在近期巴恩斯B大幅飙升之后。\n[https://www.google.ca/search?q=bb&tbm=fin#scso=_JdMIYOP4E8nN0PEPr4Wh2Ag7:0]。\n我看的是事实。\n\n * 少量的利好消息（华为\n   [https://www.fxstreet.com/news/bb-stock-price-blackberry-ltd-soars-on-patent-deal-with-huawei-202101181109]\n   还有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"嚴重]巴恩斯B是否取代蔚來、$NKLA和$HTZGQ成爲2021年的Meme股？","the_new_excerpt":"在近期巴恩斯B大幅飆升之後。\n[https://www.google.ca/search?q=bb&tbm=fin#scso=_JdMIYOP4E8nN0PEPr4Wh2Ag7:0]。\n我看的是事實。\n\n * 少量的利好消息（華爲\n   [https://www.fxstreet.com/news/bb-stock-price-blackberry-ltd-soars-on-patent-deal-with-huawei-202101181109]\n   還有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1355417807543013377","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1355417807543013377","title":"AMC Entertainment Holdings’ second-largest holder Silver Lake has sold its entire stake in the theater chain for $713 million. https://t.co/YTQuIc0iCG","date":"January 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"AMC娱乐控股的第二大股东银湖以7.13亿美元的价格出售了其在连锁影院的全部股份。https://t.co/YTQuIc0iCG。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"AMC娛樂控股的第二大股東銀湖以7.13億美元的價格出售了其在連鎖影院的全部股份。https://t.co/YTQuIc0iCG。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l8jwsl","excerpt":"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.
