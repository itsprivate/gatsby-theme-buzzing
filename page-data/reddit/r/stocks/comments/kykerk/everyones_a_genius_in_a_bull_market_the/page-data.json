We are incapable of objective evaluation of our own competency levels. I&#39;m writing about it as I&#39;ve come to realise I suffer from it.</p>\n\n<p>Dunning and Kruger&#39;s main finding from their 1999 study “Unskilled and Unaware of it” was that the worst performers consistently overestimate their ability relative to others.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve outlined two examples of this bias in action and how you can avoid some of these pitfalls:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Investing</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As the age old saying goes, &quot;Everyone is a genius in a bull market.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>When your portfolio is growing and the markets are ripping as they have in 2020, many fall victim to the Dunning-Kruger Effect. We tend to wrongly attribute this performance to our ability as talented investors.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Politics</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>An obvious example people have been using recently is Donald Trump, whose confidence never wavers, despite his weak interest and understanding of policy matters.</p>\n\n<p>The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don&#39;t know you&#39;re a member of the Dunning-Kruger club. But we&#39;re all human, and it&#39;s important to recognise that we are all prone to this cognitive bias.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few strategies to avoid it:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Identify your circle of competence</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The circle of competence is a sacred place. It&#39;s a set of topics or areas that align with a person&#39;s expertise. Be ruthless in identifying and protecting the boundaries, and it&#39;s usually smaller than you think.</p>\n\n<p>As Charlie Munger said, &quot;It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of being very intelligent.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Know your competencies, focus on them. Know your incompetencies, avoid or outsource them.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Be a first principles thinker</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A first principle is a foundational assumption or proposition - it is foundational in that it cannot be deduced from other assumptions. In chemistry, it&#39;s like an element. It cannot be broken down further.</p>\n\n<p>Ground yourself in foundational truths and build up from there. Challenge your reasoning, and most importantly, always ask why.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It isn&#39;t what you don&#39;t know that gets you in trouble. It&#39;s what you know for sure that just isn&#39;t so.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Link to original: <a href=\"https://mrsk.substack.com/p/everyone-is-a-genius-in-a-bull-market\">https://mrsk.substack.com/p/everyone-is-a-genius-in-a-bull-market</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kykerk/everyones_a_genius_in_a_bull_market_the/","title":"Everyone’s a genius in a bull market: The Dunning-Kruger Effect.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-16T17:30:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-16 17:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kykerk","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kykerk/everyones_a_genius_in_a_bull_market_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kykerk/everyones_a_genius_in_a_bull_market_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"sk2977","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/sk2977","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"sk2977","score":303,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"牛市中人人都是天才。邓宁 -克鲁格效应。","the_new_excerpt":"邓宁-克鲁格效应是一种认知偏差，能力低下的人。\n的，容易高估自己在该任务上的能力。我们是\n无法客观评价自己的能力水平。我在写\n关于它，因为我已经意识到我遭受它。\n\n邓宁和...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"牛市中人人都是天才。鄧寧 -克魯格效應。","the_new_excerpt":"鄧寧-克魯格效應是一種認知偏差，能力低下的人。\n的，容易高估自己在該任務上的能力。我們是\n無法客觀評價自己的能力水平。我在寫\n關於它，因爲我已經意識到我遭受它。\n\n鄧寧和...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25800858","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25800858","title":"Computer System Engineering","date":"January 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"计算机系统工程","locale":"zh"},{"title":"計算機系統工程","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kykugo","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kykugo/remember_this_guy_rip/","title":"Remember this guy?
