More such redemptions would prompt Wood&#39;s fund to sell liquid holdings to manage the squeeze in the near-term before looking to unwind its illiquid holdings.</p>\n\n<p>Ark Invest meanwhile shuffled its portfolio on Tuesday by cutting its already-tiny holdings in Apple, Amazon, Taiwan Semiconductor and Google-owner Alphabet to beef-up its Tesla stake on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>This is one of the problem that ark funds is trying to mitigate. Many people are very bullish and saying they are 50 to 70% into the ark funds, but they don&#39;t even know what stocks are inside these funds. People please realize that ark funds are high risk high return funds, so you should only invest a reasonable % of your portfolio into these funds.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lrnub3/record_redemption_in_ark_etf_sparks_liquidity/","title":"Record redemption in Ark ETF sparks liquidity worries","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-24T23:35:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-24 23:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lrnub3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrnub3/record_redemption_in_ark_etf_sparks_liquidity/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrnub3/record_redemption_in_ark_etf_sparks_liquidity/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"coolcomfort123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/coolcomfort123","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"coolcomfort123","score":298,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"方舟ETF赎回记录引发流动性担忧","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-ark-innovation-wood/record-redemption-in-ark-etf-sparks-liquidity-worries-idUSKBN2AO2Q2\n\n方舟投资旗舰基金创纪录的5亿美金赎回，在一次\n单日已导致分析师强调ETF重仓带来的风险。\n暴露于...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"方舟ETF贖回記錄引發流動性擔憂","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-ark-innovation-wood/record-redemption-in-ark-etf-sparks-liquidity-worries-idUSKBN2AO2Q2\n\n方舟投資旗艦基金創紀錄的5億美金贖回，在一次\n單日已導致分析師強調ETF重倉帶來的風險。\n暴露於...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lyndem","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyndem/robinhood_has_reportedly_chosen_nasdaq_for_its/","title":"⚠️ Robinhood has reportedly chosen NASDAQ for its IPO.
