Everyone knows SNOW is MASSIVELY overvalued and there is a possible short/put opportunity in the next few weeks/months as 2 more significant share unlocks are coming.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We have seen a massive run up in $SNOW with very small volume because the float is incredibly small at 30M shares prior to the first lockup. All of this is changing over the next few months. SNOWs lockup period is in three stages:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The first lockup expiration for $SNOW was on December 15th of 11M shares. Prior to the first lockup the stock ran up to $420 then going into this lockup traded all the way down to $300 into expiration.</li>\n<li>The second lockup expiration is expected Jan 4-7th per the S1 I posted below by meeting the post IPO requirements. Per the S1 below, this unlocks 37M shares, the float today is only 50M shares, that is a 60% increase in the float and with that many new shares available paired with ultra low volume we see on buy side, that should cause the stock to massively correct.</li>\n<li>The third and largest lockup is March 5th 2021 and will take the free float to 345m shares.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The stock is INCREDIBLY overvalued trading over 200 x 2021 price to sales. To put that into perspective Tesla only trades at 23 x 2021 sales.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Snow CEO options based pay is $1.3B annually while revenue this year is only $489M, can&#39;t imagine shareholders will continue to be okay with this</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Stock today trades at $350, you can see over the last week since the first lockup, MMs have been manipulating the price higher (easily done with a small float) for their clients to get out at a higher price. Look at the very low volume and also the order book.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Once the 32m shares unlock, many of which employees received at less than $10, they will be selling before the stock goes any lower, especially before the big lockup expiration in March. Given the low volume and limited buyers, it will be hard to manipulate this stock with these shares entering the market</li>\n<li>From their S1, AVG PRICE is $6.70!\n\n<ul>\n<li>As of July 31, 2020, we had outstanding options to purchase 72,228,820 shares of our Class B common stock, with a weighted-average exercise price of approximately $6.70 per share under our 2012 Plan.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Now some of you will protest saying nothing happened to Uber during their lockup expiration, however their float was 700M SHARES at unlock compared to the only 50M shares for SNOW, this is significant and will push the stock down substantially.</p></li>\n<li><p>The stock ran up to $420 after a poor earnings report, prior to that it was showing some support at $250, I think that is the minimum this stock drops to over the next few weeks. Also, if we see a market sell off, as insiders are looking to dump shares, this will fall off a cliff.</p></li>\n<li><p>I am not trying to time this perfectly. I own feb 300p to give it a few weeks after jan expiration and may 250p to give it some time after March expiration. I have 7 contracts in each.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> SNOW very overvalued with a very small float and on low volume. Two large lockup expirations coming soon that will cause the stock to plummet as insiders sell. Buy puts.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>S1 showing lockup expiring: <a href=\"https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/3189/5Y3smG.png\">https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/3189/5Y3smG.png</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kixl3x/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_possible_short/","title":"$SNOW MASSIVE Dilution Incoming & Possible Short Opportunity","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"December 24, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-24T03:49:44.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-24 03:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kixl3x","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kixl3x/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_possible_short/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kixl3x/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_possible_short/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"KingCuerv0","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/KingCuerv0","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"KingCuerv0","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"斯普林特现在大量稀释即将到来的机会和可能的短期机会","the_new_excerpt":"我为WSB整理了下面的DD(因此有了子弹)，我想我会\n在这里分享。每个人都知道雪的价值被大大高估了，有可能\n在接下来的几周/几个月内做空/放入机会，作为2个更重要的份额\n开锁马上就来了。\n\n*我们看到斯普林特Now…大幅上涨","locale":"zh"},{"title":"斯普林特現在大量稀釋即將到來的機會和可能的短期機會","the_new_excerpt":"我爲WSB整理了下面的DD(因此有了子彈)，我想我會\n在這裏分享。每個人都知道雪的價值被大大高估了，有可能\n在接下來的幾周/幾個月內做空/放入機會，作爲2個更重要的份額\n開鎖馬上就來了。\n\n*我們看到斯普林特Now…大幅上漲","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ktmnxn","excerpt":"I’m 24, I live in Arkansas.
