I used to really enjoy reading DDs on obscure or interesting companies. I loved checking the sub each day because I never knew what new pieces of information I would find. Some of my favorite stocks I found searching through new/hot. With the whole GME fiasco (I like WSB but I like to keep it separate from my actual investments) every single stock market community seems to be exclusively focused on pumps or squeezes or meme stocks and I just want a community to discuss interesting companies and fundamentals. Is there any subreddit people could recommend me for this? I wouldn’t exactly consider myself a value investor but I do look for reasonably valued growth companies.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lcele5/where_can_a_regular_investor_get_stock/","title":"Where can a regular investor get stock information on Reddit these days?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-04T15:42:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-04 15:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lcele5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcele5/where_can_a_regular_investor_get_stock/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcele5/where_can_a_regular_investor_get_stock/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Haigfish","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Haigfish","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Haigfish","score":815,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"现在的普通投资者哪里能在Reddit上获得股票信息？","the_new_excerpt":"我和其他大股民一起成为了这个社区的成员。\n社区在Reddit上已经有几年了。我曾经非常喜欢阅读\n晦涩或有趣的公司的DD。我喜欢每天查看子\n因为我永远不知道我会发现什么新的信息。有些...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"現在的普通投資者哪裏能在Reddit上獲得股票信息？","the_new_excerpt":"我和其他大股民一起成爲了這個社區的成員。\n社區在Reddit上已經有幾年了。我曾經非常喜歡閱讀\n晦澀或有趣的公司的DD。我喜歡每天查看子\n因爲我永遠不知道我會發現什麼新的信息。有些...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-libn68","excerpt":"Alright so we all know the subreddit is now being monitored by media, investors\nand hedge funds.
