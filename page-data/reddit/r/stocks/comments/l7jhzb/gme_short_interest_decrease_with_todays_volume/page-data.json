(FYI I believe this data is only released every couple weeks, so stop believing that people have up to date SI/%, we can only speculate)</p>\n\n<p>The DTC was so low because the volume was so high (93M) that day right? With a (56M) vol does DTC just scale linearly into 3.5 days? Meaning, in one day, they’d only be able to cover 17.7M, or 30%? So worst case, short interest is at worst 90%+ still?</p>\n\n<p>The above is a complete and utter guess based on my limited knowledge, so please correct me if I’m wrong.
