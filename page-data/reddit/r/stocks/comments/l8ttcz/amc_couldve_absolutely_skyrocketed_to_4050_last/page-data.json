It allowed AMC to sell shares directly to the public to raise cash to run the business. They got $300+ million in cash but were selling at under $5/share. This took the <strong>float from 100M to 160M shares</strong>. <em>Up 60%</em>. Because of the prior run up and buzz already starting, the was eaten up by the public without any significant change to the stock price. It probably should&#39;ve risen a few bucks given they <strong>DILUTED 60%</strong>, but for time&#39;s sake I&#39;ll ignore since overall market cap was still low. </p>\n\n<p><strong>1B - $600 Million debt conversion to shares</strong></p>\n\n<p>Overnight the stock was up 3-4x going into Wednesday dramatically increasing share price and market cap. They had a prior debt agreement which allowed for conversions from bonds into stock. Given the overnight increase in price, this was executed. <strong>Silver Lake obtained $600 million dollars worth of shares at the agreed price of ~$13</strong>. This was sold on the market during the morning. This translates to another <strong>44M shares</strong>. If we take a look Wednesday&#39;s chart. <strong>We see they opened at $20, but immediately dropped to the day low of $11.01</strong>. This was likely due to newly available shares (and some sell off). The public was buying shares and stock rose to $17.50 before downward pressure (some sell off, also assume a second chunk of new shares. If we remove even half of these down trends (assuming the other half is profit taking), the stock should&#39;ve closed at about <strong>$26.</strong></p>\n\n<p>See these charts for a simple <a href=\"https://imgur.com/Fryz3CM\">Before</a> and <a href=\"https://imgur.com/1HYvQQQ\">After</a>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>2 - Limited purchases</strong></p>\n\n<p>We all know this part. In premarket the stock was up to $23 (Up another 15%), but opened at $12. I&#39;m losing steam here, but imagine another 15% from yesterday&#39;s predicted 26 (<strong>$30 open</strong>). And clearly continued gain which started again Friday. but even still was impacted by return of restrictions by trading apps (There was another post with charts to back this up already, I wont repeat it).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>AMC added 100M shares significantly limiting this run up, and there are already talks of more <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/amc-entertainment-explores-raising-new-capital-as-its-stock-surges-sources-say.html\">on the way</a>. </li>\n<li>AMC remains with significant debt and limited income, making the previous bullet point even more possible</li>\n<li>Short float may be ~20% after dilution, depending if shorts covered or added to positions.</li>\n<li>This stock really could have MOONED faster than even GME, if not for the offerings and trading apps interfering.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>\n\n<p>AMC diluted shareholders by $1B and 100M shares in two days. Without these extra 100M shares doubling the shares available, the stock would&#39;ve risen DRAMATICALLY higher. This was compounded by trading apps preventing purchases. Additionally, shorts got diluted and now might estimated at just~20% of float. <strong>BE CAREFUL.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong on anything.... but I may not respond right away given my circumstances at home! Good luck to all, be cautious, and consider donating some of your profits to charities.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l8ttcz/amc_couldve_absolutely_skyrocketed_to_4050_last/","title":"AMC could've absolutely skyrocketed to $40-$50 last week, here's why it didn't.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-31T01:35:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-31 01:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l8ttcz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8ttcz/amc_couldve_absolutely_skyrocketed_to_4050_last/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8ttcz/amc_couldve_absolutely_skyrocketed_to_4050_last/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"moab361","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/moab361","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"moab361","score":117,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"AMC上周绝对可以暴涨到40-50美元，这就是为什么没有。","the_new_excerpt":"免责声明：\n\n * 我不在金融业工作\n * 我没有投资或做空。\n * 我的妻子是几个小时的路程从劳动，所以我试图写这之前，它是。\n   去医院的时间。\n * 我也在WSB上发过这个帖子，但觉得这是一个不同的受众。\n\n如果不是2个（重大）事件，上周我想... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"AMC上週絕對可以暴漲到40-50美元，這就是爲什麼沒有。","the_new_excerpt":"免責聲明：\n\n * 我不在金融業工作\n * 我沒有投資或做空。\n * 我的妻子是幾個小時的路程從勞動，所以我試圖寫這之前，它是。\n   去醫院的時間。\n * 我也在WSB上發過這個帖子，但覺得這是一個不同的受衆。\n\n如果不是2個（重大）事件，上週我想... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lfb5jt","excerpt":"> In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more\n> flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not\n> required to maintain adequate operating liquidity.
