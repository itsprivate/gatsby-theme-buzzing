I executed on all of them except SFIX and CRSRS because both of them shot up hard. The rest I entered and either exited at 75% profit or I am still holding. I want to begin to move to at least 40% cash since the market is extended at these levels. I will probably be slightly more patient with some plays going forward. Think I might just add a couple more puts sold to open on PLTR. As a side note, looks like I broke that $100k barrier for good now. When I started this journey with you all 3 months ago I was only at $75k</p>\n\n<h1>Old Positions</h1>\n\n<p><strong>ARCT:</strong> even though I said I would hold until I was profitable I will be closing this. It will free up much more capital and allow me to make other trades now that it&#39;s closed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>FSLY + OSTK</strong>: These are in my zones to close the positions and will do so by EOD today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GME:</strong> Currently holding $15 puts sold to open and they are still only 50% profit. Crazy how high the IV is that it&#39;s still giving good premiums for a put requiring a 60% drop in just 3 weeks. I want to sell more here, but I&#39;m not sure about the risk/reward with how the stock is moving.</p>\n\n<h1>New positions from this week</h1>\n\n<p><strong>JMIA:</strong> This one rocketed up 15% the day after I sold puts which was great for me. They still have a few weeks to go so they aren&#39;t losing value that fast. I will hold through the 3-day weekend and re-evaluate next week.</p>\n\n<p><strong>COTY, FEYE, PLTR</strong>: All 3 of these pretty much haven&#39;t moved, so I&#39;m waiting.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/y8XX2l4\">Positions screenshot</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxaxpk/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_update/","title":"I draw with crayons so you don't have to.
