I started trading this year just to see if I could make a little bit of money instead of letting it sit in my savings account and managed to make $35k+ so far in profits off of about $6k of my student loan refund. I&#39;m confused if this fucks me over since I&#39;m in college and have no job. Not sure if I&#39;m getting paranoid for no reason.</p>\n\n<p>Theoretically if I made $100,000+ in profits would I fuck myself over tax wise or with any penalties? Or should I just report what I can on my tax return and move on?</p>\n\n<p>The stock that I made the most money off is currently projected to do really well and I&#39;m thinking I will make substantially more. I don&#39;t want to sell yet but I do want to make sure I don&#39;t get in trouble or screw it up. After the success with mine, I later had my boyfriend do the same thing with his stocks and he made $8,000. He&#39;s not in college and is employed so we&#39;ve been paying some attention to his tax bracket and capital gains tax but aren&#39;t sure what to do for my situation.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR; In college with no job. Used college loans in stock market and made $35,000 profit. Is there anything special I should do for my tax return? And theoretically if I made $200,000 in profit or $1 million in profit...what would be the next steps?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I’m 27</p>\n\n<p>Update: Ended up securing $20k profits on AMPE. Might buy back some if there’s a big dip. I might post updates on Monday if all goes well? Hopefully...</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for all of the advice!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kfq891/started_trading_this_year_no_job_took_6000_of_my/","title":"Started trading this year.
