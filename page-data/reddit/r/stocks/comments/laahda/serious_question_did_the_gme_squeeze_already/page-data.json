Then I found this information a few hours ago, and it has me worried for the people indefinitely holding, with the expectation of a squeeze coming soon. I&#39;m new to the stock market but have learned a bit in the last week. Am I reading this wrong, or have the percentage of shorted shares dropped to 49.21%?</p>\n\n<p>If the squeeze already happened last friday, how is lying about it or hiding this information to keep people buying/holding GME stock, to increase personal profits, ANY different then the bullshit that Hedge Funds do? That is active manipulation and deception for personal gain, not an altruistic attempt to &#39;take down Goliath&#39;, which is why many people (myself included) supported/support the GME/AMC fight.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Even ASKING for people to explain this information to me has resulted in mass downvotes, ZERO direct responses explaining why I am wrong, and a post I made about it on WSB, was deleted within 30 seconds by mods. No explanation was provided for the quick deletion, and after asking why it was deleted, I was ignored. (edit - AND Shadowbanned, as I recently just noticed.)</p>\n\n<p>Is this a &quot;David vs. Goliath&quot; type of fight, or essentially a Ponzi scheme for people who invested early and/or with large funds?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Am I crazy/wrong, or is ignorance and greed now fueling this &#39;movement&#39;? <strong><em>ANY</em></strong> explanation is greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>edit- Shoutout to the mods here for reinstating this post after it was initially removed. The mods over at WSB shadowbanned me after I asked the same question.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/laahda/serious_question_did_the_gme_squeeze_already/","title":"Serious question, did the GME squeeze already happen?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-01T20:34:53.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-01 20:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"laahda","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/laahda/serious_question_did_the_gme_squeeze_already/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/laahda/serious_question_did_the_gme_squeeze_already/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Tazwhitelol","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tazwhitelol","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Tazwhitelol","score":837,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"严重的问题是，金交所的挤压已经发生了吗？","the_new_excerpt":"https://i.imgur.com/6BGahUN.jpg\n\n从我知道WSB对抗对冲基金开始，我就一直支持WSB。\n大约一个星期前。然后，我在几个小时前发现了这个信息，它让我。\n忧心忡忡的人无限期地持有，与期望的挤压。\n即将到来。我是新来的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"嚴重的問題是，金交所的擠壓已經發生了嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"https://i.imgur.com/6BGahUN.jpg\n\n從我知道WSB對抗對沖基金開始，我就一直支持WSB。\n大約一個星期前。然後，我在幾個小時前發現了這個信息，它讓我。\n憂心忡忡的人無限期地持有，與期望的擠壓。\n即將到來。我是新來的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lgevvc","excerpt":"I mean seriously.
