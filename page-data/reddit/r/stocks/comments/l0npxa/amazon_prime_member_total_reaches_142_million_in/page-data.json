In other words, in the December quarter new and renewing members took advantage of the lower annualized cost of a yearly membership, and with that made a longer commitment to Amazon Prime. These new members will be around well into 2021.”</p>\n\n<p>According to a January report, eMarketer estimates global e-commerce sales of $4.28 trillion in 2020, up 27.6% from 2019.
