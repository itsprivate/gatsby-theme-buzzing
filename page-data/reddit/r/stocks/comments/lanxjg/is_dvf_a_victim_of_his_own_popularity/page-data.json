Given that WSB has a few inadequate members who might threaten DFV’s safety, if something goes wrong. As DFV just became a public person and his name and other personal details are widely known, this becomes even trickier.</p>\n\n<p>I might be downvoted, but a fact that I saw people in WSB calling a little kid who sold his GME shares (from the recent news) “a little c*nt” just pisses me off as this crosses all the borders.</p>\n\n<p>Hope, nothing terrible happens to DFV and he pulls out from GME at the right time without raising to much hate from his followers. I guess loosing his reputation is also something that he might not want, but are millions a good price for being called a legend of a Reddit community?</p>\n\n<p>What would you do if you were in his shoes?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: made a typo in the title, supposed to be DFV</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lanxjg/is_dvf_a_victim_of_his_own_popularity/","title":"Is DVF a victim of his own popularity?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T19:47:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 19:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lanxjg","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lanxjg/is_dvf_a_victim_of_his_own_popularity/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lanxjg/is_dvf_a_victim_of_his_own_popularity/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"lebrokholic","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lebrokholic","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"lebrokholic","score":70,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"DVF是自己人气的受害者吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我有一种感觉，在获得如此多的关注之后，u/deepfuckingvalue。\n[/u/deepfuckingvalue]陷入了自己的人气陷阱，有问题的任何\n公众可能拥有的，特别是当很多人的财富都是依赖的时候。\n对他的决定。\n\n他一定有一个两难的选择：他卖的太...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"DVF是自己人氣的受害者嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我有一種感覺，在獲得如此多的關注之後，u/deepfuckingvalue。\n[/u/deepfuckingvalue]陷入了自己的人氣陷阱，有問題的任何\n公衆可能擁有的，特別是當很多人的財富都是依賴的時候。\n對他的決定。\n\n他一定有一個兩難的選擇：他賣的太...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lgxx3h","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgxx3h/yolo_am_i_doing_this_right/","title":"Yolo!
