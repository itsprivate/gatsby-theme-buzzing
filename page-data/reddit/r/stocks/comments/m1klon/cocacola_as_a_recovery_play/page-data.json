We&#39;ve seen big moves out of the airlines and cruise companies, but I personally feel that Coca-Cola is a stronger re-opening play than either of those.</p>\n\n<p>KO is trading at just under $51 as of today&#39;s close, down from its pre-COVID high of $60 last year. The company was hit hard by their consumers being stuck at home for months, unable to dine out and attend sporting events or concerts. Revenue and earnings were down in 2020, and even with vaccines coming out it may still be a while until they return to 2019 levels.</p>\n\n<p>With that being said, Coca-Cola took steps to re-organize their business to become more efficient in order to respond to the pandemic. I think that they can emerge from the pandemic as a more focused business, and once top-line revenues catch back up the company could really see some improvements in their earnings.</p>\n\n<p>Their CEO touched on some of these aspects in their earnings call back in February:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://equisolve-private.s3.amazonaws.com/cocacolacompany/db/764/7664/file/CORRECTED%20TRANSCRIPT_%20The%20Coca-Cola%20Co.%28KO-US%29%2C%20Q4%202020%20Earnings%20Call%2C%2010-February-2021%208_30%20AM%20ET.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAVOH5SHIJOSUYOLRZ&amp;Expires=1615332187&amp;Signature=oPMiBI1hM9jbiC2m%2FNpNed8vwfU%3D\">https://equisolve-private.s3.amazonaws.com/cocacolacompany/db/764/7664/file/CORRECTED%20TRANSCRIPT_%20The%20Coca-Cola%20Co.%28KO-US%29%2C%20Q4%202020%20Earnings%20Call%2C%2010-February-2021%208_30%20AM%20ET.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAVOH5SHIJOSUYOLRZ&amp;Expires=1615332187&amp;Signature=oPMiBI1hM9jbiC2m%2FNpNed8vwfU%3D</a></p>\n\n<p>Even with the headwinds they faced in the past year, KO still managed to increase their annual dividend to $1.64, their 39th consecutive annual increase. Of all of the so-called &quot;reopening plays,&quot; I feel like KO has not had a huge bounce due to changing investor sentiment. For example, cruise lines like Carnival are issuing new shares just to stay afloat (literally), and are months away from even being able to receive passengers. Yet investors have already pumped their shares 30% in the past month. I understand that KO is only 16% below their pre-COVID high so I&#39;m not expecting a 25% run up out of them in the next month or anything. I&#39;m just surprised that more people don&#39;t seem to be getting behind this name. With restrictions being lifted across the country, the amount of Coke products that will be bought at convenience stores, restaurants, and arenas will start to pick up. There&#39;s a pent-up demand for people to get out of the house, but not everyone is financially able to book a cruise or plane ticket right now. However, almost anyone can celebrate by taking their family to the local pizzeria or taco place and washing their meal down with a Coke or Sprite. There are hundreds of restaurants in NYC alone that will be increasing their orders for both flavor syrup and bottled drinks now that indoor dining is returning.</p>\n\n<p>With that being said, my plan at the moment is to use a small portion of my portfolio (~10%) to scoop some shares on the next drop to $50 or below. This would be at least a year hold, to collect the dividend income along with hopefully $5-10 in gains per share. About 70% of my portfolio is loaded to the tits with PLTR (300 @ 32 lol), IPOE, PSTH, and some biotech, so on the recent dip I&#39;ve been thinking about adding some value plays like KO or COST.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to post a Discussion here rather than go the DD route because I&#39;m not 100% sold on this play myself. If you have any opinions about KO (good or bad) please share! I&#39;m obviously not worried that the stock is gonna tank 50% or anything, but my main fear is that it could trade sideways between $48 and $52 for the next 6 months, and if tech finds some more room to run I&#39;d hate to miss out on those gains.</p>\n\n<p>Is KO a good re-opening play? Are there better value plays out there rn? Can tech keep running after this correction? I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice and I have no shares of KO at the present time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m1klon/cocacola_as_a_recovery_play/","title":"Coca-Cola as a recovery play?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-10T22:13:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-10 22:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m1klon","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m1klon/cocacola_as_a_recovery_play/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m1klon/cocacola_as_a_recovery_play/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Florida_Knight77","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Florida_Knight77","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Florida_Knight77","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"可口可乐作为复苏剧？","the_new_excerpt":"大家都很清楚，在过去的几个月里，市场一直在狂奔\n周，在 \"重开 \"的同时，科技股被打压，而其他价值游戏如\n能源大多表现良好。我们看到航空公司的大动作和\n邮轮公司，但我个人觉得可口可乐是一...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"可口可樂作爲復甦劇？","the_new_excerpt":"大家都很清楚，在過去的幾個月裏，市場一直在狂奔\n周，在 \"重開 \"的同時，科技股被打壓，而其他價值遊戲如\n能源大多表現良好。我們看到航空公司的大動作和\n郵輪公司，但我個人覺得可口可樂是一...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26413343","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26413343","title":"What does any of this have to do with physics?
