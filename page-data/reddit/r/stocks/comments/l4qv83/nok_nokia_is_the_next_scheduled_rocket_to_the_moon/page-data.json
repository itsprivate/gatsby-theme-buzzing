Furthermore NOK&#39;s short term assets (€17.4B) also exceed its <strong>long</strong> term liabilities (€12.2B). Their debt to equity ratio (37.9%) is considered satisfactory. Some may be concerned by the fact that NOK&#39;s debt to equity ratio has increased from 30.1% to 37.9% over the past 5 years. However NOK&#39;s debt is well covered by operating cash flow (42.8%) so I&#39;m not stressing and neither should you.</p>\n\n<p>NOKIA&#39;s board of directors are considered experienced (3.7 years average tenure).
