I currently hold ten percent ARKK and wanted to put another 5 percent in another ARK fund and was hoping for ARKG. However when I go through the weightings of ARKG&#39;s holdings it seems they are a lot of small and medium cap companies. My worry is that ARK owns around ten percent of these companies and this is quite a risky play.</p>\n\n<p>Does ARKG manage too much money for them to achieve what they want to do in ARKG or is my logic flawed. I truly believe genomics is a great ten year strategy but is this fund too big to be nimble enough to navigate this volatile area? I notice recently they are buying into bigger pharma companies (Roche, Takeda, Nov) is this just to park cash or is there an actual genomics play here. A quick glance at their pipeline I couldn&#39;t find much.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for clearing this up as I&#39;m quite new to this.</p>\n\n<p>I also used <a href=\"https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php\">https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php</a> to find out the fund overlaps</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lk2v21/arkg/","title":"ARKG","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-15T08:38:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-15 08:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lk2v21","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lk2v21/arkg/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lk2v21/arkg/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Gucci_Bane_","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gucci_Bane_","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Gucci_Bane_","score":84,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ARKG","the_new_excerpt":"ARKG权重\n\n嘿，我对这些ARK基金比较陌生。我目前持有10%的ARKK和\n想再投5%到另一只ARK基金，并希望能投ARKG。\n然而当我翻看ARKG的持股比重时，似乎他们是一\n很多中小市值的公司。我的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ARKG","the_new_excerpt":"ARKG權重\n\n嘿，我對這些ARK基金比較陌生。我目前持有10%的ARKK和\n想再投5%到另一隻ARK基金，並希望能投ARKG。\n然而當我翻看ARKG的持股比重時，似乎他們是一\n很多中小市值的公司。我的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26261314","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26261314","title":"GNU Taler – Payment system for privacy-friendly, fast, easy online transactions","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"GNU Taler - 用于隐私友好、快速、便捷的在线交易的支付系统。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GNU Taler - 用於隱私友好、快速、便捷的在線交易的支付系統。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26262989","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26262989","title":"A solo journey to $100k","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 25, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"一个人的10万之旅","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一個人的10萬之旅","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lk2v21","previousId":"HnPost-26261314","nextId":"HnPost-26262989","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lk2v21/arkg/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
