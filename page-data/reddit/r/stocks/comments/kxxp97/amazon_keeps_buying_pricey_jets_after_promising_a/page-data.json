The ultimate aim is to ensure that virtually every product the company sells is a van ride—and eventually a drone flight—away from customers’ homes. And yet, last week Amazon announced it was buying 11 Boeing 767-300 jets for its air-cargo division, mostly to get products to Prime subscribers.</p>\n\n<p>The expanded air-cargo operation will add billions of dollars to already hefty shipping costs that amounted to $52 billion in the 12 months ended in September. Though Amazon is one of the wealthiest and most valuable companies in the world, it has historically operated on razor-thin margins and plowed cash back into the business, sometimes to the consternation of investors who’d rather see the company focus on profitability.</p>\n\n<p>Even as Amazon expands its air-cargo division, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos remains fixated on his ultimate dream: building a network so sophisticated it can get just about anything to a customer’s doorstep in 30 minutes or less. One day his vision will bring another air carrier to life, the Prime Now drone fleet, that along with autonomous vehicles and electric vans could make it less necessary to fly stuffed giraffes across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the award.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxxp97/amazon_keeps_buying_pricey_jets_after_promising_a/","title":"Amazon Keeps Buying Pricey Jets After Promising a Drone Fleet","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-16T00:04:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-16 00:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kxxp97","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxxp97/amazon_keeps_buying_pricey_jets_after_promising_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxxp97/amazon_keeps_buying_pricey_jets_after_promising_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"coolcomfort123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/coolcomfort123","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"coolcomfort123","score":66,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"亚马逊在承诺建立无人机舰队后，继续购买昂贵的喷气式飞机。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/amazon-prime-overnight-shipping-guarantees-rely-on-fleet-of-pricey-jets?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google\n\n亚马逊公司在美国开设仓库和航运中心的速度。\n大约每24小时一个。最终目的是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"亞馬遜在承諾建立無人機艦隊後，繼續購買昂貴的噴氣式飛機。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/amazon-prime-overnight-shipping-guarantees-rely-on-fleet-of-pricey-jets?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google\n\n亞馬遜公司在美國開設倉庫和航運中心的速度。\n大約每24小時一個。最終目的是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l54gji","excerpt":"What if this is the new standard?\n\nWhat if with COVID, people realized they had a lot of unused money laying around\nand they decided to invest it in stock, bitcoin, gold and even collectibles\n(pokémon, magic and figures have seen huge spikes on extra-rare items).\n\nOf course, there is the side of…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l54gji/what_if_this_was_not_a_bubble_but_a_price/","title":"What if this was not a bubble - but a price correction?","date":"January 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果这不是泡沫--而是价格修正呢？","the_new_excerpt":"如果这是新的标准呢？\n\n如果有了COVID，人们意识到他们有很多闲置的钱，怎么办？\n他们决定将其投资于股票、比特币、黄金甚至收藏品上\n(pokémon、魔法和人偶的特级品出现了巨大的飙升)。\n\n当然，还有一方面是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果這不是泡沫--而是價格修正呢？","the_new_excerpt":"如果這是新的標準呢？\n\n如果有了COVID，人們意識到他們有很多閒置的錢，怎麼辦？\n他們決定將其投資於股票、比特幣、黃金甚至收藏品上\n(pokémon、魔法和人偶的特級品出現了巨大的飆升)。\n\n當然，還有一方面是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l51xgw","excerpt":"Thinking this will really run, especially Tuesday, as the hyped demo day is\nafter hours then.\n\nIt seems by buying these contracts, gamma squeezes are artificially being made,\nI noticed this on different stocks as well, just pick the highest weekly strike\nand go all in. 15% to $40 PLTR is, will it…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l51xgw/103k_weekly_40c_pltr_contracts_purchased_today/","title":"103k weekly $40C PLTR contracts purchased today","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 26, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"今天购买的10.3万周40C PLTR合约。","the_new_excerpt":"认为这将真正运行，特别是周二，因为催生的演示日是。\n那么下班后。\n\n看来通过买入这些合约，人为地进行了伽马挤压。\n我在不同的股票上也注意到了这一点，只要选择每周最高的罢工率\n并全力以赴。15%到40美元的PLTR是，将... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"今天購買的10.3萬周40C PLTR合約。","the_new_excerpt":"認爲這將真正運行，特別是週二，因爲催生的演示日是。\n那麼下班後。\n\n看來通過買入這些合約，人爲地進行了伽馬擠壓。\n我在不同的股票上也注意到了這一點，只要選擇每週最高的罷工率\n並全力以赴。15%到40美元的PLTR是，將... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kxxp97","previousId":"RedditPost-l54gji","nextId":"RedditPost-l51xgw","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxxp97/amazon_keeps_buying_pricey_jets_after_promising_a/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
