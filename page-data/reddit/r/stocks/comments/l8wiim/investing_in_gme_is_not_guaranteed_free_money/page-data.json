This may have started as retail vs hedge fund, but by now, it&#39;s definitely retail and hedge funds vs hedge funds. There is incredibly smart money, willing to trade emotionlessly with perfect information and bots  in a battle of timing on both sides of this trade. The fact that it closed at $200/share on Thursday means hedge funds with near infinite money were thinking it&#39;s probably not worth participating in the short squeeze for more than $200/share. The pros didn&#39;t think it was guaranteed money at $200/share and the pros never turn down guaranteed free money. That should bring great caution to anyone still looking to get in. </p>\n\n<p>What will likely happen is it will end up selling for large amounts per share for a very short amount of time, and then very rapidly crater in price. Hedge funds on the long side of the trade will be able to execute their sells near perfectly, and retail traders will likely be bag holders after it craters who don&#39;t have access to bots for perfectly executed sells. Another very real possibility is there is no pop, remember, the hedge funds didn&#39;t buy up all the shares at $200 and just wait for it to climb to $250. They didn&#39;t think it was guaranteed to go to $250, which would be well under a pop level.</p>\n\n<p>This is just my opinion, but I&#39;d exercise great caution before touching this with a 10 foot pole at these prices, and definitely not with any meaningful amount of money. I&#39;d also strongly consider cashing some out if you are already in. Ask yourself how you&#39;d feel if you lost 90% of the current value of your  gme shares, as that&#39;s a very reasonably likely outcome for the non-pros, imo.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l8wiim/investing_in_gme_is_not_guaranteed_free_money/","title":"Investing in GME is not guaranteed free money","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-31T08:56:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-31 08:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l8wiim","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8wiim/investing_in_gme_is_not_guaranteed_free_money/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8wiim/investing_in_gme_is_not_guaranteed_free_money/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"IEatYourToast","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/IEatYourToast","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"IEatYourToast","score":58,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"投资GME不保证免费赚钱","the_new_excerpt":"我见过很多散户投资者清算投资组合的故事，以达到以下目的\n参与Gamestop的短线挤压。这可能是一开始零售与\n对冲基金，但到现在，肯定是散户和对冲基金与对冲基金。\n有不可思议的聪明资金，愿意交易...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"投資GME不保證免費賺錢","the_new_excerpt":"我見過很多散戶投資者清算投資組合的故事，以達到以下目的\n參與Gamestop的短線擠壓。這可能是一開始零售與\n對沖基金，但到現在，肯定是散戶和對沖基金與對沖基金。\n有不可思議的聰明資金，願意交易...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26067188","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26067188","title":"Reminder: Terraria Dev’s Google Story Is Not Unusual at All","date":"February 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"提醒。Terraria Dev的谷歌故事一点也不稀奇","locale":"zh"},{"title":"提醒。Terraria Dev的谷歌故事一點也不稀奇","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lfaapa","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfaapa/on_this_date_in_1637_the_infamous_tulip_bubble/","title":"On this date in 1637, the infamous tulip bubble burst abruptly ending the year of speculative market growth","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 08, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"1637年的这一天，臭名昭著的郁金香泡沫突然破灭，结束了这一年的投机市场增长期","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"1637年的這一天，臭名昭著的鬱金香泡沫突然破滅，結束了這一年的投機市場增長期","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l8wiim","previousId":"HnPost-26067188","nextId":"RedditPost-lfaapa","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l8wiim/investing_in_gme_is_not_guaranteed_free_money/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
