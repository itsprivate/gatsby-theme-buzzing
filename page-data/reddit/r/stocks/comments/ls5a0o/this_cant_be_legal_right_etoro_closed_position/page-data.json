This was obviously worrying as the downside risk of my trade had increased a lot; but I still had faith in my decision and watched it climb back into a profit, before I had the chance to sell, Etoro had MORE technical issues, this time locking me out for the entire evening/morning.</p>\n\n<p>When It allowed me back in my trade had been closed just hours before, when the market was well above my stop-loss level. I started emailing Etoro for help and they claim to have retroactively closed my position for the price that the stop-loss would have activated.</p>\n\n<p>Key points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The same technical issue that stopped me from selling in a profit, stopped their stop-loss from closing my trade</li>\n<li>They closed my trade without my consent, and I did not receive even close to market value at the time of my trade being closed</li>\n<li>If we are able to retroactively pick a point on a chart where I <em>should</em> have sold, but didn&#39;t due to ETOROs <em>technical issue</em> why at the point of maximum loss and not maximum gain (or at least where I tried and was signed out)?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have tried to contact Etoro support, but they sent one canned response saying what they did, and have stopped answering.</p>\n\n<p>I understand I entered a risky position, I am ok with the risk of losing due to the market, but it seems like Etoro made it impossible for me to do anything but lose the maximum amount here.</p>\n\n<p>I am using Australian Etoro if it makes a difference.</p>\n\n<p>Where can I go from here?
