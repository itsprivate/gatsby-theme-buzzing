It seems that the influx of competition in the EV market has been causing their share price to slip. It’s also well known that Tesla is extremely overpriced. I make a point to never underestimate hype, and Tesla is a great example of this. Disregarding share price, it’s a great company as well. However, it seems like it’s beginning or in the middle of a correction. I’m invested long term, but I am wondering what your thoughts are for Tesla’s future as oftentimes the first in a new market only enjoys an advantage until the competition shows up and economic profit begins decreasing. Thanks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lq4ckx/thoughts_on_tsla/","title":"Thoughts on $TSLA","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T05:14:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 05:14","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lq4ckx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lq4ckx/thoughts_on_tsla/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lq4ckx/thoughts_on_tsla/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Sekou_17","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sekou_17","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Sekou_17","score":64,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"对$TSLA的看法","the_new_excerpt":"我在3月份跌停的时候因为科威的原因买入了特斯拉，并一直持有着\n自。看来，电动车市场竞争的涌入，已经引起了\n其股价要下滑。众所周知，特斯拉也是极其\n价格过高。我的观点是永远不要低估炒作，而特斯拉是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對$TSLA的看法","the_new_excerpt":"我在3月份跌停的時候因爲科威的原因買入了特斯拉，並一直持有着\n自。看來，電動車市場競爭的湧入，已經引起了\n其股價要下滑。衆所周知，特斯拉也是極其\n價格過高。我的觀點是永遠不要低估炒作，而特斯拉是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1364043102978265090","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1364043102978265090","title":"This is rich https://t.co/B3rig1Wzv0","date":"February 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"这是丰富的https://t.co/B3rig1Wzv0。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"這是豐富的https://t.co/B3rig1Wzv0。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lq1gks","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq1gks/nyse_gme_correction_of_60230_shares_on_the_buy/","title":"NYSE GME correction of 60230 shares on the Buy Side.
