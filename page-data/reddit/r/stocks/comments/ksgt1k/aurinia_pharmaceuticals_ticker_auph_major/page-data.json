I will post link to the main article explaining in detail about it, but in short:</p>\n\n<p>-Aurinia Pharmaceuticals has one of the most important milestones in its history in a few weeks.</p>\n\n<p>-Next January 22, 2021 is the PDUFA where the FDA will decide the approval of the candidate drug Voclosporin.</p>\n\n<p>-Voclosporin approval by the FDA is almost assured (estimated at 95% chance of approval) thanks to the very good phase III trial data presented last December 2019.</p>\n\n<p>-Estimates of the potential revenues that Voclosporin could generate worldwide once approved range from $1.5B to $3B per year.</p>\n\n<p>They also have around $400+ mill in cash on hand with great leadership. </p>\n\n<p>The only other completion they have in this field is Glaxosmithkline that currently produces an inferior product (just approved dec 17) and is currently trading at $38/share</p>\n\n<p>Right now AUPH is only $13 a share, and with the high probability of being approved in a couple weeks, I have a feeling this thing will 🚀 straight to the moon, and evidence of that is how it jumped to $21 last December when it released its phase 3 trial results. Currently all analysts have a buy rating at a PT average of $23.</p>\n\n<p>Do your own DD, but I’m in with $5k waiting for this home run</p>\n\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4395615-aurinia-pharmaceuticals-offers-good-entry-opportunity-next-pdufa-for-voclosporin\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4395615-aurinia-pharmaceuticals-offers-good-entry-opportunity-next-pdufa-for-voclosporin</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ksgt1k/aurinia_pharmaceuticals_ticker_auph_major/","title":"Aurinia pharmaceuticals (Ticker: AUPH) MAJOR catalyst January 22","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-07T21:30:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-07 21:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ksgt1k","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ksgt1k/aurinia_pharmaceuticals_ticker_auph_major/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ksgt1k/aurinia_pharmaceuticals_ticker_auph_major/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Noideawhatimdoing90","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Noideawhatimdoing90","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Noideawhatimdoing90","score":63,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"金黄色制药公司(行情代码：AUPH)主要催化剂1月22日","the_new_excerpt":"所以，在最近所有的医学狂热发生的情况下，我对公司做了一些DD\n随着即将到来的催化剂的出现，股票可能会飙升，并跌入金星\n制药公司。我会贴出主要文章的链接，详细解释\n它，但简而言之：\n\n-金色制药拥有最多的…之一","locale":"zh"},{"title":"金黃色製藥公司(行情代碼：AUPH)主要催化劑1月22日","the_new_excerpt":"所以，在最近所有的醫學狂熱發生的情況下，我對公司做了一些DD\n隨着即將到來的催化劑的出現，股票可能會飆升，並跌入金星\n製藥公司。我會貼出主要文章的鏈接，詳細解釋\n它，但簡而言之：\n\n-金色製藥擁有最多的…之一","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25673441","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25673441","title":"Ask HN: How would you convince your friends and family to switch from WhatsApp?","date":"January 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"HN提问：你如何说服你的朋友和家人改用WhatsApp？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"HN提問：你如何說服你的朋友和家人改用WhatsApp？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1347290630188367873","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1347290630188367873","title":"Robinhood investors day trading Robinhood’s stock when it goes public: https://t.co/do786cn1rk","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 07, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"罗宾汉上市时，投资者每天交易罗宾汉的股票：https://t.co/do786cn1rk","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"羅賓漢上市時，投資者每天交易羅賓漢的股票：https://t.co/do786cn1rk","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-ksgt1k","previousId":"HnPost-25673441","nextId":"TweetPost-1347290630188367873","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ksgt1k/aurinia_pharmaceuticals_ticker_auph_major/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
