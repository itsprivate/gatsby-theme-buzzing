I do part time jobs here and there as I can but it&#39;s not sustainable between MH and seizures.</p>\n\n<p>I have a teenager who I have been saving for since I don&#39;t want him to start out like I did, having to enlist because of no other opportunities, so between trying to stretch necessities and taking care of him there hasn&#39;t been much left.</p>\n\n<p>Discovered BTC several years ago. Bought and stupidly sold at a loss. Got back in the game in early 2019 and have been stacking sats since.</p>\n\n<p>Feels like this is a rare opportunity to rise above my lot in life so to speak and I think because of that I worry that maybe it&#39;s all some kind of pyramid scheme because.. seriously can the powers that be really let this happen? I can&#39;t contribute to society much anymore so I&#39;m supposed to always be on the bottom rung.</p>\n\n<p>And that mindset is what made me sell years ago and I worry I&#39;ll psych myself out and do it again.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone else feel it&#39;s too good to be true?</p>\n\n<p>And because I&#39;ve been DCAing here and there its not anything I haven&#39;t already mentally written off or will completely collapse if BTC does.</p>\n\n<p>Just doesn&#39;t feel like something people like me can accomplish.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you for coming to my therapy session 😆 these last couple of months have been a ride.</p>\n\n<p>2nd edit: I&#39;m a mom not a dad haha. The username doesn&#39;t let on I guess.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kp2rop/anyone_else_feel_bitcoin_is_their_only_shot/","title":"Anyone else feel Bitcoin is their only shot?","tags":["Bitcoin","reddit"],"date":"January 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-03T05:49:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-03 05:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kp2rop","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kp2rop/anyone_else_feel_bitcoin_is_their_only_shot/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kp2rop/anyone_else_feel_bitcoin_is_their_only_shot/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bitcoin","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin","author":"Repulsive-Diver1838","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Repulsive-Diver1838","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Repulsive-Diver1838","score":168,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"还有谁觉得比特币是他们唯一的机会？","the_new_excerpt":"我是这里的残疾兽医，他以前在科技公司工作，但我的创伤后应激障碍和创伤后应激障碍\n使得它不可能跟上这一领域，并最终成为完全\n在退伍军人管理局标准下不能受雇。我尽我所能做一些兼职工作，但是\n在MH和癫痫之间是不可持续的。\n\n我有一个十几岁的孩子，我用…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"還有誰覺得比特幣是他們唯一的機會？","the_new_excerpt":"我是這裏的殘疾獸醫，他以前在科技公司工作，但我的創傷後應激障礙和創傷後應激障礙\n使得它不可能跟上這一領域，並最終成爲完全\n在退伍軍人管理局標準下不能受僱。我盡我所能做一些兼職工作，但是\n在MH和癲癇之間是不可持續的。\n\n我有一個十幾歲的孩子，我用…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kpau9f","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kpau9f/let_that_sink_in/","title":"Let that sink in","date":"January 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"让它深入人心。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"讓它深入人心。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kp759s","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kp759s/the_bitcoin_paradox/","title":"The Bitcoin paradox","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 03, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"比特币悖论","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"比特幣悖論","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kp2rop","previousId":"RedditPost-kpau9f","nextId":"RedditPost-kp759s","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kp2rop/anyone_else_feel_bitcoin_is_their_only_shot/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","386998304","4203388852"]}
