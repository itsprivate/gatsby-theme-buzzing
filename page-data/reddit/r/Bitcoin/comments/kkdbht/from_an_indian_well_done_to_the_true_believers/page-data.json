Venezulean securing his future. Bitcoin grandma our new Hodler.</p>\n\n<p>I heard Bitcoin in Aug 2017. It kind of stuck with me. I was baptized with fire in dealing with the various noises in this ecosystem. </p>\n\n<p>The massive pumps and dumps, Bitcoin Cash noise, Ripple fan boys, exchanges crashing, Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffets monologues. The bear market was fun. </p>\n\n<p>In my country, Bitcoin was banned for 19 months right through the bear market. I couldnt buy. But Thanks to you beautiful people on this forum, I always felt connected to this amazing revolution. </p>\n\n<p>I became wiser every day I read your views. When the ban was removed in March this year, the mankind was facing a Pandemic. But I had clarity in my thoughts and bulldozed my way into accumulating sats day in day out. </p>\n\n<p>Hell yeah. I am 400% up in my portfolio. I am already looking for the next halvening in 2024 when Bitcoin will become even more harder money. </p>\n\n<p>Should I have bought more sats or full bitcoins? How does it matter? I believe I have now a solid stake in this silent revolution to make the world better place. </p>\n\n<p>Well done Hodlers!!! </p>\n\n<p>Remember: </p>\n\n<p>Invest only what you can afford to lose. If you want to deserve $100k coin, you need to stomach $4k coin. </p>\n\n<p>Learn how to protect your newly found wealth!!! You are the bank!!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kkdbht/from_an_indian_well_done_to_the_true_believers/","title":"From an Indian: Well done to the true believers","tags":["Bitcoin","reddit"],"date":"December 26, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-26T15:48:44.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-26 15:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kkdbht","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kkdbht/from_an_indian_well_done_to_the_true_believers/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kkdbht/from_an_indian_well_done_to_the_true_believers/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bitcoin","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin","author":"gsarin1980","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/gsarin1980","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"gsarin1980","score":75,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"来自一位印度人：做得好，献给真正的信徒","the_new_excerpt":"比特币正在加速逃逸速度，将“HODLER”从破碎的\n腐败的货币体系。\n\n我们在这个论坛上读到了一些令人惊叹的故事。威尼斯人保护他的\n未来。比特币奶奶我们的新霍德勒。\n\n我在2017年8月听说比特币。这有点让我难以释怀。我接受了…的洗礼","locale":"zh"},{"title":"來自一位印度人：做得好，獻給真正的信徒","the_new_excerpt":"比特幣正在加速逃逸速度，將“HODLER”從破碎的\n腐敗的貨幣體系。\n\n我們在這個論壇上讀到了一些令人驚歎的故事。威尼斯人保護他的\n未來。比特幣奶奶我們的新霍德勒。\n\n我在2017年8月聽說比特幣。這有點讓我難以釋懷。我接受了…的洗禮","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kkdnyn","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kkdnyn/junior_peter_schiff/","title":"Junior Peter Schiff","date":"December 26, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"小彼得·希夫","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"小彼得·希夫","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kkgxh6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kkgxh6/even_2020_was_a_shitshow_in_general_crypto/","title":"Even 2020 was a shitshow in general, crypto brought some joy and made it better for us","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"December 26, 2020","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"即使2020年总体来说也是一场垃圾秀，Crypto给我们带来了一些欢乐，让我们的生活变得更好","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"即使2020年總體來說也是一場垃圾秀，Crypto給我們帶來了一些歡樂，讓我們的生活變得更好","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kkdbht","previousId":"RedditPost-kkdnyn","nextId":"RedditPost-kkgxh6","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kkdbht/from_an_indian_well_done_to_the_true_believers/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","386998304","4203388852"]}
