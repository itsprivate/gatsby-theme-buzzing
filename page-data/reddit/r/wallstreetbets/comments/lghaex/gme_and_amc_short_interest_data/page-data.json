I don’t know if guys are assuming the Short Interest on Finra is the % of the float. Short interest ≠ Short Interest % of Float. They are different.

The discrepancies in the data across all these sites is all you need to know.

Paying the fine could potentially save them billions of dollars.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 4:</strong> Hedge funds, if you&#39;re reading this right now, go fuck yourself.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lghaex/gme_and_amc_short_interest_data/","title":"GME and AMC short interest data","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T09:32:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 09:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lghaex","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lghaex/gme_and_amc_short_interest_data/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lghaex/gme_and_amc_short_interest_data/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"missing_the_point_","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/missing_the_point_","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"missing_the_point_","score":7449,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME和AMC短息数据","the_new_excerpt":"Finra、Fintel和《华尔街日报》的报道比例不同。\n\nFinra - GME\n[http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH]\n  78.46\nFinra - AMC\n[http://finra...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME和AMC短息數據","the_new_excerpt":"Finra、Fintel和《華爾街日報》的報道比例不同。\n\nFinra - GME\n[http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH]\n  78.46\nFinra - AMC\n[http://finra...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lnrr7a","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnrr7a/gabe_slips_that_squeeze_has_not_squozeth/","title":"Gabe Slips that Squeeze has NOT Squozeth 🚀🚀","date":"February 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Gabe Slips that Squeeze has NOT Squozeth 🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Gabe Slips that Squeeze has NOT Squozeth 🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lno5kl","excerpt":"https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-sensors-for-self-driving-cars\n\nApple (AAPL) - Get Report is negotiating with several sellers of\nself-driving-car sensors about purchasing their wares, a media report says.\n\nThis is another good move for apple to diversify its…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lno5kl/apple_reportedly_in_talks_to_buy_sensors_for/","title":"Apple Reportedly in Talks to Buy Sensors for Self-Driving Cars","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 20, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"据报道，苹果正在洽谈购买自动驾驶汽车的传感器。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-sensors-for-self-driving-cars\n\n苹果(AAPL)--得到报告正在与几家卖家谈判。\n有媒体报道称，自动驾驶汽车传感器关于购买其商品。\n\n这对于苹果来说，又是一个多元化发展的好举措，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"據報道，蘋果正在洽談購買自動駕駛汽車的傳感器。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-sensors-for-self-driving-cars\n\n蘋果(AAPL)--得到報告正在與幾家賣家談判。\n有媒體報道稱，自動駕駛汽車傳感器關於購買其商品。\n\n這對於蘋果來說，又是一個多元化發展的好舉措，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lghaex","previousId":"RedditPost-lnrr7a","nextId":"RedditPost-lno5kl","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lghaex/gme_and_amc_short_interest_data/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
