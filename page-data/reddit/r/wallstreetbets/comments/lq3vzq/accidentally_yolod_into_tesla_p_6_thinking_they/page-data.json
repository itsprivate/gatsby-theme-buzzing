Everything I could afford and still pay rent. When I bought them the buy price was 8.5 and sell 0. Yes 0. I thought that was because they were just so far OTM. Today I watched Tesla tank and neither the buy or sell price moved. I looked at some of the other Tesla options available on IG (there&#39;s only a really random assortment available, not a whole chain). I realized they were all 10000+ and calls at 60000 were something like 5x the price of puts at 60000. I&#39;m now convinced that for some stupid reason IG prices option strikes in cents for equities (I have traded VIX options with them before and they&#39;re priced in dollars). So I&#39;m 99% sure I just YOLO&#39;d into $6 puts. I can&#39;t sell them cause they&#39;re worth exactly 0. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve been so stupid. Guess I 💎✋with my only hope being Tesla going bankrupt (I think they&#39;re overvalued but never going bankrupt). Wish me luck I guess. Fuck me</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: spent all my savings on Tesla $6p Jan 22 thinking they were $600p Jan 22</p>\n\n<p>Proof: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/ZTDWmVp\">http://imgur.com/gallery/ZTDWmVp</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit 1: I&#39;m currently on the phone to IG and the guy is insisting that they are for $600 and IG don&#39;t have any for $6. I&#39;m trying to explain that it&#39;s impossible for them to be for $600 pls help.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3vzq/accidentally_yolod_into_tesla_p_6_thinking_they/","title":"Accidentally YOLO'd into Tesla P $6 thinking they were $600","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T13:24:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 13:24","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lq3vzq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3vzq/accidentally_yolod_into_tesla_p_6_thinking_they/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3vzq/accidentally_yolod_into_tesla_p_6_thinking_they/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/nNfQci5uXJv70l-bcXwjqneXczLK84hxDcsc1_g1fDs.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fdd6701b478db9825921f37a27718798d8516aa2","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"NoahBLB","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/NoahBLB","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"NoahBLB","score":3431,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"不小心YOLO到了特斯拉P 6美元，以为是600美元","the_new_excerpt":"所以我住在英国，上周我用IG买了125倍特斯拉把600 1月22日。\n那是1000英镑。我的学生贷款。我可以负担得起的一切，仍然支付租金。\n当我买入他们的时候，买入价是8.5，卖出价是0.是的0.我想这是...。\n因为他们只是远远的OTM。今天我看了特斯拉的坦克... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不小心YOLO到了特斯拉P 6美元，以爲是600美元","the_new_excerpt":"所以我住在英國，上週我用IG買了125倍特斯拉把600 1月22日。\n那是1000英鎊。我的學生貸款。我可以負擔得起的一切，仍然支付租金。\n當我買入他們的時候，買入價是8.5，賣出價是0.是的0.我想這是...。\n因爲他們只是遠遠的OTM。今天我看了特斯拉的坦克... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lxwhpy","excerpt":"As promised in the discussion thread I would post some updated info on what\nFriday could bring in terms of ITM options.\n\nTL;DR the number of possible contracts ITM could be DOUBLE last weeks expiry.\nOver 4 million shares could be called on for these exercised options only adding\nto the ever…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxwhpy/gme_possibility_of_gamma_squeeze_just_went/","title":"GME - POSSIBILITY OF GAMMA SQUEEZE JUST WENT THROUGH THE ROOF","date":"March 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"如同在讨论主题中所承诺的那样，我将发布一些最新的信息，关于什么是\n周五可能带来的ITM选项方面。\n\nTL;DR的数量可能的合同ITM可能是两倍上周到期。\n超过400万股可以调用这些行使的选项，只有增加\n对不断...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"如同在討論主題中所承諾的那樣，我將發佈一些最新的信息，關於什麼是\n週五可能帶來的ITM選項方面。\n\nTL;DR的數量可能的合同ITM可能是兩倍上週到期。\n超過400萬股可以調用這些行使的選項，只有增加\n對不斷...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1367634053235683331","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1367634053235683331","title":"Stocks only go up https://t.co/MVspL4PMxH","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 05, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"股票只涨不跌https://t.co/MVspL4PMxH","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"股票只漲不跌https://t.co/MVspL4PMxH","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lq3vzq","previousId":"RedditPost-lxwhpy","nextId":"TweetPost-1367634053235683331","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3vzq/accidentally_yolod_into_tesla_p_6_thinking_they/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
