Then they have the nerve to turn us into public enemy #1 just because we believe in an underdog company getting a second chance. </p>\n\n<p>We don’t have billionaires to bail us out when we mess up our portfolio risk and a position goes against us. We can’t go on TV and make attempts to manipulate millions to take our side of the trade. If we mess up as bad as they did, we’re wiped out, have to start from scratch and are back to giving handjobs behind the dumpster at Wendy’s. </p>\n\n<p>Seriously. Motherfuck these people. I sincerely hope they suffer. <strong>We want to see the loss porn.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l54ky3/an_open_letter_to_cnbc/","title":"An open letter to CNBC","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T10:01:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 10:01","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l54ky3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l54ky3/an_open_letter_to_cnbc/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l54ky3/an_open_letter_to_cnbc/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"RADIO02118","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/RADIO02118","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"RADIO02118","score":19551,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"致CNBC的一封公开信","the_new_excerpt":"在你再花一天时间接待你的骗子对冲基金朋友来之前\n的空气和妖魔化r/wallstreetbets [/r/wallstreetbets]我希望你能读到这个。\n\n我一直在想，这些做空GME的基金，就像你在Melvin的孩子们一样。\n首都/你对这个分论坛的报道，我越来越... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"致CNBC的一封公開信","the_new_excerpt":"在你再花一天時間接待你的騙子對沖基金朋友來之前\n的空氣和妖魔化r/wallstreetbets [/r/wallstreetbets]我希望你能讀到這個。\n\n我一直在想，這些做空GME的基金，就像你在Melvin的孩子們一樣。\n首都/你對這個分論壇的報道，我越來越... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lbo5ce","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbo5ce/gamestop_appoints_chief_technology_officer_ex/","title":"GameStop Appoints Chief Technology Officer ex Amazon AWS 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","date":"February 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GameStop任命前亚马逊AWS首席技术官🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GameStop任命前亞馬遜AWS首席技術官🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26005758","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26005758","title":"Engineering productivity can be measured, just not how you'd expect","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 03, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"工程生产力是可以衡量的，只是不是你所期望的那样。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"工程生產力是可以衡量的，只是不是你所期望的那樣。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l54ky3","previousId":"RedditPost-lbo5ce","nextId":"HnPost-26005758","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l54ky3/an_open_letter_to_cnbc/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
