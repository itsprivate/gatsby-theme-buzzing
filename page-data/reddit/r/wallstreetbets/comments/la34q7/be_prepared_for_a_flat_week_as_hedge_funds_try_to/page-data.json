So if I were a greedy, fraudulent bastard who would try to bankrupt a company for a few bucks and would rather risk crashing the market than take a loss, how would I deal with a hungry pack of 🦍 🦍 🦍 beating down my door for my lunch money? Well, we’ve seen them try a number of dirty tactics to try and scare us into selling. Short ladders, lying in the media that they closed their position, restricting free trading of a stock, and more. But all of these moves had one thing in common, and failed for the same reason: it showed us that they are DESPERATE for us to SELL, only confirming to us that they do in fact still hold a huge short position. </p>\n\n<p>So then what could they do to convince us that it’s over and the short squeeze won’t ever squoze? The answer is simple: nothing. Stop driving the price down, stop the FUD campaigns, just do... nothing. Let us sweat it out and speculate while the paper handed start to fold and trigger a selloff. The interest they would have to pay on their position is PENNIES compared to the difference if they can manage to close their positions in the $100s instead of the $1,000s. </p>\n\n<p>Don’t panic if the price is flat today, or all week, or even next week. It could very well be the next step in their plan. You can’t expect to make it to Mars without stopping for fuel once you break out of Earth’s atmosphere 🚀🚀🚀🚀. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR apes together strong 🚀🚀🚀🚀 —&gt; 💎💎💎💎💎 —&gt; 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la34q7/be_prepared_for_a_flat_week_as_hedge_funds_try_to/","title":"Be prepared for a flat week as hedge funds try to make us lose interest","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-01T16:57:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-01 16:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"la34q7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la34q7/be_prepared_for_a_flat_week_as_hedge_funds_try_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la34q7/be_prepared_for_a_flat_week_as_hedge_funds_try_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"NoExplorer6","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/NoExplorer6","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"NoExplorer6","score":48600,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"准备好迎接平淡的一周，因为对冲基金试图让我们失去兴趣。","the_new_excerpt":"在这样的情况下，我试着把自己放在对方的位置上。所以如果我\n是一个贪婪的，欺诈性的混蛋 谁会试图破产的公司，以几个。\n块钱，宁可冒着崩盘的风险，也不愿意承担损失，我怎么会。\n处理饥饿的包 🦍 🦍 🦍 🦍 打下来我的门... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"準備好迎接平淡的一週，因爲對沖基金試圖讓我們失去興趣。","the_new_excerpt":"在這樣的情況下，我試着把自己放在對方的位置上。所以如果我\n是一個貪婪的，欺詐性的混蛋 誰會試圖破產的公司，以幾個。\n塊錢，寧可冒着崩盤的風險，也不願意承擔損失，我怎麼會。\n處理飢餓的包 🦍 🦍 🦍 🦍 打下來我的門... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26077823","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26077823","title":"Haskell: The Bad Parts, part 2 (2020)","date":"February 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Haskell: 坏的部分，第二部分(2020年)","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Haskell: 壞的部分，第二部分(2020年)","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lg9gxw","excerpt":"AMC gang wya?\n\nhas everyone forgotten about AMC ? why was it just pushed under the radar and no\none talks about it anymore?
