Naked short selling, the illegal practice of selling shares that aren’t known to exist, is just one possible cause of a failure-to-deliver, with more quotidian reasons being human error and administrative delays.</p>\n\n<p>“Fails-to-deliver can occur for a number of reasons on both long and short sales,” reads a disclaimer on the SEC website. “Therefore, fails-to-deliver are not necessarily the result of short selling, and are not evidence of abusive short selling or ‘naked’ short selling.”</p>\n\n<p>Failures to deliver can result in fines, losses as well as reputational harm, and in rare circumstances there’s also a risk they could lead to a reduction of market liquidity.</p>\n\n<p>One thing is clear: the Grapevine, Texas-based company is an anomaly in the data. Ranked by the dollar value of traded shares that couldn’t be delivered -- a sum that was influenced by the ballooning price of GameStop’s shares -- it was the only company to appear multiple times in the top 10 during the period. And it was only one of two companies, the other being Li Auto Inc., to feature atop a list dominated by exchange-traded funds.</p>\n\n<p>The data, which is released twice a month, tracks securities that had at least 10,000 shares that failed-to-deliver on a daily basis. The total number of shares for each day is a “cumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day,” according to the SEC’s website.</p>\n\n<p>About 2.1 million GameStop shares failed-to-deliver on Jan. 26 before falling to 138,179 on Jan. 29, the day after Robinhood and other brokerages began restricting trading in so-called meme stocks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llxbg0/about_21_million_gamestop_shares_failedtodeliver/","title":"About 2.1 million GameStop shares failed-to-deliver on Jan. 26 before falling to 138,179 on Jan. 29, the day after Robinhood and other brokerages began restricting trading in so-called meme stocks.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-17T18:31:38.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-17 18:31","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"llxbg0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llxbg0/about_21_million_gamestop_shares_failedtodeliver/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llxbg0/about_21_million_gamestop_shares_failedtodeliver/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/RDtm4HoCgrRgmL8mesrl-lUrigrgKdh_sYOkxjXq8S4.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7c6fde0c88e7d21caa9d9e1b095c7c42d328653b","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"yo-dk","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/yo-dk","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"yo-dk","score":18958,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"约210万股GameStop股票在1月26日未能交付，然后在1月29日跌至138179股，在Robinhood和其他经纪公司开始限制所谓的备忘录股票交易的第二天。","the_new_excerpt":"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-data-show-359-million-144445943.html\n\nSEC数据显示，3.59亿美元的GameStop股票未能兑现（彭博社）--。\n1月28日，在GameStop Corp.的狂热达到高潮的第二天。\n短暂的挤压记录，约3.59亿美元的价值。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"約210萬股GameStop股票在1月26日未能交付，然後在1月29日跌至138179股，在Robinhood和其他經紀公司開始限制所謂的備忘錄股票交易的第二天。","the_new_excerpt":"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-data-show-359-million-144445943.html\n\nSEC數據顯示，3.59億美元的GameStop股票未能兌現（彭博社）--。\n1月28日，在GameStop Corp.的狂熱達到高潮的第二天。\n短暫的擠壓記錄，約3.59億美元的價值。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ltd1h9","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltd1h9/squazozzle_update_226_citadelvin_tried_so_hard/","title":"Squazozzle update 2/26: Citadelvin tried so hard today.
