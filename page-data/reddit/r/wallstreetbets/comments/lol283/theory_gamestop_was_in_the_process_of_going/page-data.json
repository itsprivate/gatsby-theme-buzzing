I found some interesting information that leads me to a retarded ape-like conspiracy.</p>\n\n<p>Short end of it, I think Gamestop was in the process of closing everything down and I think the real estate division were giving Melvin inside information which is why they went so heavy on the shorts to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>Let me explain my thought process. Maybe I&#39;m retarded but you apes help me to see if I&#39;m crazy or autistic.</p>\n\n<p>The real estate connection begins with this PDF document:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/CCIMCONNECT/8f473331-34dc-49b0-a5cc-4a6fe64f26ec/UploadedFiles/VqsY4FaMQna7C7UeT3Kb_CCIM%20Preferred%20Partners%20Book%202019.pdf\">https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/CCIMCONNECT/8f473331-34dc-49b0-a5cc-4a6fe64f26ec/UploadedFiles/VqsY4FaMQna7C7UeT3Kb_CCIM%20Preferred%20Partners%20Book%202019.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>CCIM is a commercial real estate group that basically just puts people together in a room and does conferences and shit.</p>\n\n<p>The PDF starts off innocently. Just a thank you note, President&#39;s Forward and random ads.</p>\n\n<p>But then it begins to list a directory of members. On Page 46 there&#39;s a strange coincidence.</p>\n\n<p>Gamestop&#39;s real estate leasing manager, Christopher Morris is listed.</p>\n\n<p>Right underneath is Scott A. Morris of...... Citadel Partners LLC.</p>\n\n<p>I was like holy shit when I saw that and I looked into it and Citadel Partners is a real estate group in Texas, doesn&#39;t seem to be a connection to our evil Citadel overlords. Just... a really funny coincidence. Maybe someone wrinklier brained than I can find an actual connection lol</p>\n\n<p>But then I did some other digging and found a random document:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&amp;id2=0\">https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&amp;id2=0</a></p>\n\n<p>Which is a voting form for Ascena Retail Group&#39;s bankruptcy filing.</p>\n\n<p>On page 49 and 50 something jumped out at me:</p>\n\n<p>GOLDMAN SACHS &amp; CO -- F/A/O MELVIN CAPITAL MGMT LP -- ATTN PRIME BROKER ACCOUNT</p>\n\n<p>Idk if it&#39;s well known, because I had no idea but apparently Goldman Sachs handles Melvin&#39;s accounts.</p>\n\n<p>I looked further into it and found:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd\">https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Custodian</strong> Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co LLC, JP Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co LLC, National Financial Services LLC</p>\n\n<p>Melvin is in publicly bed with Goldman and JP Morgan.</p>\n\n<p>And it just so happens Jason Butler of JP Morgan Chase bank is also listed in that CCIM real estate group directory. I can&#39;t find anything about what Jason Butler does except this page which shows him as an analyst:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://invest.arenapharm.com/analyst-coverage\">https://invest.arenapharm.com/analyst-coverage</a></p>\n\n<p>So would it be impossible to think that Christopher Morris, Gamestop&#39;s regional leasing manager, Jason Butler an analyst at JP Morgan got together at any one of the events CCIM held in 2014 (<a href=\"https://www.ccim.com/networking/past-meetings-conferences/\">https://www.ccim.com/networking/past-meetings-conferences/</a>) and had a little discussion about how Gamestop was considering bankruptcy as the digital age may be putting them in a bad position financially?</p>\n\n<p>And then at that point word got around to Melvin who&#39;s probably paying for information like this from any one of their insider analysts at Goldman or JP Morgan and decided it&#39;s a safe bet to start shorting Gamestop?</p>\n\n<p>Then all this shit hits the fan and now Gamestop is doing better than they&#39;ve ever done and now have no plans to continue that route of possible bankruptcy and Ryan Cohen swooping in to save the day destroying all of Melvin&#39;s hard insider traded tendies.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a cooky theory but plausible.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Forgot to mention current position 48 @ $77 </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lol283/theory_gamestop_was_in_the_process_of_going/","title":"Theory: Gamestop was in the process of going bankrupt, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Melvin were in the process of profiting from inside information obtained from GME real estate division.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-21T04:35:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-21 04:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lol283","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lol283/theory_gamestop_was_in_the_process_of_going/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lol283/theory_gamestop_was_in_the_process_of_going/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"thabat","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/thabat","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"thabat","score":18582,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"理论。当时Gamestop正处于破产过程中 JP摩根、高盛和Melvin正在从GME房地产部门获得的内部信息中获利。","the_new_excerpt":"所以我就在谷歌上随便找找看。我发现了一些有趣的\n信息，导致我到一个弱智的猿类阴谋。\n\n简而言之，我认为Gamestop正在关闭所有的东西。\n我认为房地产部给了Melvin内部消息，而这些消息...\n是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"理論。當時Gamestop正處於破產過程中 JP摩根、高盛和Melvin正在從GME房地產部門獲得的內部信息中獲利。","the_new_excerpt":"所以我就在谷歌上隨便找找看。我發現了一些有趣的\n信息，導致我到一個弱智的猿類陰謀。\n\n簡而言之，我認爲Gamestop正在關閉所有的東西。\n我認爲房地產部給了Melvin內部消息，而這些消息...\n是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26323600","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26323600","title":"Deno v1.8 – support for WebGPU, private modules, Intl, and much more","date":"March 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Deno v1.8 - 支持WebGPU、私有模块、IntlL等。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Deno v1.8 - 支持WebGPU、私有模塊、IntlL等。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1366876514327945220","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1366876514327945220","title":"There's only inflation in things we spend money on.
