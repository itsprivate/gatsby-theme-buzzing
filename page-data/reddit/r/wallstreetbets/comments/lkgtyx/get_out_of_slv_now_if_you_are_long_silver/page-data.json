Not only SLV is worthless paper, which is backed by...nothing, but it&#39;s actually used to SUPPRESS SILVER PRICES.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll try to sum it up for retards :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>People buy SLV shares, making SLV buy silver and ship it to their vaults (sureeee...)</li>\n<li>Silver prices barely increase even though premiums are extremely high and bullion dealers are struggling to ship orders due to the massive demand.</li>\n<li>What&#39;s likely happening is that SLV didn&#39;t buy shit and is actually keeping your dollars...to guess what ? To buy silver when it&#39;s cheaper.</li>\n<li>But how is that called, when instead of buying something, you sell it and hope to buy it back at a lower price...mhm ? <strong>That&#39;s right, shorting.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>THAT&#39;S FUCKING RIGHT. THEY MAY BE USING YOUR $SLV MONEY TO ACTUALLY SHORT SILVER. THEY&#39;RE ACTING AGAINST YOUR INTEREST.</h1>\n\n<p>What ape do if silver go to moon ? Sell $SLV and then what buy?  🦍 ❓</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Safe bet : buying silver bullion. It&#39;s hard to find and you&#39;ll pay high premiums sadly. But it&#39;s the best way to actually make sure you have silver, because you&#39;re you&#39;re own bank. It&#39;s in your hands. This isn&#39;t a risky play at all.</li>\n<li>$PSLV (Sprott Physical Silver) is transparent on their silver and they show footage of delivery, etc. So it&#39;s actually backed by real silver. It&#39;s a closed end fund, which means they will not create new shares unless they take delivery of additional silver in their vaults.</li>\n<li>Buying miners shares. Now we&#39;re getting monkey YOLO. Junior miners tend to skyrocket when silver prices go up. They&#39;re a big leverage on silver prices. They can easily go 200% or so. 🚀 🚀</li>\n<li>Buying junior miners options. Very high IV, but the ultimate monkey play. Leveraging the fucking lever ! Extremely risky but extremely rewarding. 🚀</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t financial advice of any sort. I&#39;m not qualified to give any. I don&#39;t have tangible proof that SLV is doing that but neither do they have any fucking proof that they&#39;ve been buying silver, especially since the price haven&#39;t skyrocketed like they should. <strong>Silver, unlike gold, is a TIGHT market.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Relevant positions : $SA and around 37 lbs of silver coins + 3 oz of gold in my pirate chest. Planning to buy calls on $SILJ as a small yolo play.  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer : lots of junior miners are penny stocks and therefore not allowed to be posted on WSB.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkgtyx/get_out_of_slv_now_if_you_are_long_silver/","title":"GET OUT OF $SLV NOW IF YOU ARE LONG SILVER !","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-16T02:04:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-16 02:04","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lkgtyx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkgtyx/get_out_of_slv_now_if_you_are_long_silver/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkgtyx/get_out_of_slv_now_if_you_are_long_silver/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/J8s08m-RK7Fw9Ueu1Dgex0P0ra9CXVYFRm1P69bvy88.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=1f1559829d0ab3526e3171ca1e018c682b2663f9","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"proloyster","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/proloyster","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"proloyster","score":1465,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果你是白银多头，现在就离开$SLV!","the_new_excerpt":"解释发生了什么的视频[https://streamable.com/j3lgj5]\n\n我怎么强调都不为过。不仅SLV是一文不值的纸，这是有支持的\n由......没什么，但它实际上是用来压制银价的。\n\n我试着给弱智们总结一下......。\n\n *人们买入SLV股票，使得SLV买入白银并运...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果你是白銀多頭，現在就離開$SLV!","the_new_excerpt":"解釋發生了什麼的視頻[https://streamable.com/j3lgj5]\n\n我怎麼強調都不爲過。不僅SLV是一文不值的紙，這是有支持的\n由......沒什麼，但它實際上是用來壓制銀價的。\n\n我試着給弱智們總結一下......。\n\n *人們買入SLV股票，使得SLV買入白銀並運...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ls7jd0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls7jd0/here_we_go_again/","title":"Here we go again...","date":"February 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"又来了...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"又來了...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lsc5a9","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsc5a9/everyone_on_this_sub_now_btw_buy_more_gme/","title":"Everyone on this sub now - btw BUY MORE GME 🚀🚀🚀💎👐","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 26, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"每个人都在这个子上了 - btw BUY MORE GME 🚀🚀🚀💎👐。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"每個人都在這個子上了 - btw BUY MORE GME 🚀🚀🚀💎👐。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lkgtyx","previousId":"RedditPost-ls7jd0","nextId":"RedditPost-lsc5a9","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkgtyx/get_out_of_slv_now_if_you_are_long_silver/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
