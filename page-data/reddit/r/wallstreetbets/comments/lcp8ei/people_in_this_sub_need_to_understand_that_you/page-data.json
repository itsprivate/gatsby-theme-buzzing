I can see comments of single mother putting her life savings in and college kids borrowing money at a very high interest and going all in.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a joke. Losing money is not a joke. If you get a loan and buy a stock, you are at a risk. Only buy with money that you can afford to lose. Don&#39;t put your life savings or retirement corpus on this. \nFor people who are getting emotional and going all in against the hedge funds, the hedge funds will have a small scratch and you would be destroyed in the end. The concept of YOLO with buying stocks works only till you don&#39;t go bankrupt.</p>\n\n<p>I know this sub is now filled with a lot of new people telling you to buy the dip. Don&#39;t get emotional with money. This sub is for people who like to invest money that they can afford to lose, and not your life&#39;s savings when you are a single mother.</p>\n\n<p>I know Ill get downvoted to oblivion saying a statement like this, when the whole sub would be filled with &quot;to the moon 🚀&quot;\nBut please don&#39;t put in money you can&#39;t afford. Don&#39;t get loans and buy stocks. Money ain&#39;t coming easy and all the money you lost is earned by the hedge funds you wanted to destory in the first place.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Edit 1 : I dint expect this post to blow up. I honestly thought it would be downvoted to oblivion. But thanks folks. And I am not paper handed, still holding to the 1 stock I bought. I&#39;ll take it to the end. \nI&#39;m not asking people to sell, just to not buy with money they can&#39;t afford to lose.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcp8ei/people_in_this_sub_need_to_understand_that_you/","title":"People in this sub need to understand that you only invest with the money you can afford to lose.
