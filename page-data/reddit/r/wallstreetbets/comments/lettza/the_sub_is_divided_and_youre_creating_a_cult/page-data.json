There&#39;s people who have never touched the stock market until 2 weeks ago getting to know a lot of new trendy terms like &quot;short squeeze,&quot; &quot;counterfeit shares,&quot; learning what a Bloomberg terminal is etc etc. Listen - that&#39;s amazing. I love seeing people get educated, especially in this community, because long-term that means loss porn for us.</p>\n\n<p>What I worry about is that BECAUSE people are learning so much, so quickly, they now feel like they&#39;re the experts among their friends and are in over their heads. One one of the recent top posts was comparing the GME and AMC charts, saying how similar they were. Everyone in the comments was screaming &quot;MAHNEEPULASHIONNNNNN.&quot; COULD it have been manipulation? I mean... yes... But market <strong>correlation</strong> is very, very common and normal. I don&#39;t think I need to explain this but for those of you who want to understand, feel free to ask. Now, I&#39;m not saying anything about the overall movement of the stocks, as I don&#39;t know enough to tell you if it was overall manipulation, but the correlation doesn&#39;t mean shit.</p>\n\n<p>PLEASE do your research before posting this shit. This is why the vets are pissed at all the GME pumping: it&#39;s in large by people who don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about. Not everyone who&#39;s done with GME is a Melvin bot, as much as you&#39;d like to believe. It&#39;s all too easy to get caught up in the whole story and feel like every little thing is manipulated against you. I do hold some GME and would love to see it blow up again, but fuck guys, take what you read with a grain of salt. If you have a thesis that you believe in, you should ALWAYS know the bearish case too. Consider what the other side is saying too. You&#39;ll either feel more confident (and not need to get your confirmation bias...) or you&#39;ll realize maybe you were wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The other side of the story is the OGs who have also been around for years. I see why you&#39;re pissed. The sub has changed tremendously over the last month. At the same time, I want you guys to also remember that this GME thing is turning into a cult and the more aggressively you attack these newbies the more you push them to the conspiracy side. It&#39;s not exactly the essence of WSB to teach people (lol) BUT if you just leave comments saying &quot;you&#39;re an idiot.&quot; or &quot;you should have sold like I did retard&quot; you&#39;re only making the problem worse.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;ve been around long enough you know that things will probably go back to normal once we get to a bearish market again. Then we can continue losing money together in peace.</p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr: pleas wsb again</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lettza/the_sub_is_divided_and_youre_creating_a_cult/","title":"The sub is divided and you're creating a cult.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-08T14:43:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-08 14:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lettza","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lettza/the_sub_is_divided_and_youre_creating_a_cult/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lettza/the_sub_is_divided_and_youre_creating_a_cult/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"alevelup","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/alevelup","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"alevelup","score":2960,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"子是分裂的，你正在创造一个邪教。","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，伙计们，我一直在关注WSB多年了，但最近才开始。\n发帖。\n\n我很担心，因为两边都有极端分子，所以这个子越来越分裂了\n的整个GME传奇。有的人从来没有碰过股票市场。\n直到2周前认识了很多新潮的......。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"子是分裂的，你正在創造一個邪教。","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，夥計們，我一直在關注WSB多年了，但最近纔開始。\n發帖。\n\n我很擔心，因爲兩邊都有極端分子，所以這個子越來越分裂了\n的整個GME傳奇。有的人從來沒有碰過股票市場。\n直到2周前認識了很多新潮的......。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lmk8f3","excerpt":"DUE DILIGENCE OF BITCOIN MINING STOCK VALUATIONS: RIOT AND MARA\n\nUnlike the 2017/18 rise of Bitcoin, the 2020/21 Bitcoin price action has been\nlargely driven and influenced by institutional demand.\n\nWith institutional demand comes institutional products.
