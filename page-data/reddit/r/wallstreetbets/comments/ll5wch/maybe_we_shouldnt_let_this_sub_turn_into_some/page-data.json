Most of us saw the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkzviy/i_am_going_to_short_the_whole_country_of_south/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\">post</a>  made by a nutjob who wants to short South Africa. It’s filled with copious amounts of misinformation from someone who claims to be a historian who “studied the country for a long time”. It also goes against what this sub is about</p>\n\n<p>The market is a casino and we’re all here to play. Politics has no place here. Despite the OP saying his post isn’t political. It is. He calls one political party a band of pirates (which there is no proof for) and claims another party is responsible for having inflation rates above 9% twice in 20 years (3 times in 27) because of quantitative easing, which is a crappy idea has only been brought in recently due to the pandemic. The times where this inflation spike happened were in 2008, a tough year for the whole world economically, In 2002 before South Africa’s big corruption scandal under Zumba happened, and in 1993, when said party wasn’t even in power! So much for being a historian. Look, South Africa isn’t a paradise with rainbows, butterflies and crayons dipped in glue, it’s got some of the problems most 3rd world countries do, but it’s absolutely NOTHING like the mostly racist hellhole with sanctioned corruption that the OP described.</p>\n\n<p>I could make an entire post arguing against the crap he said but my wife’s boyfriend is typing this for me and he’s upset that I’m wasting time that he could be spending plowing his girl. And also because that would be hypocritical because I’m against making this sub political. We’re not here to play heroes.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Someone said we should short South Africa and gave blatantly politically motivated and downright false information to persuade people to join him. We shouldn’t. And we shouldn’t allow posts like that to get attention.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Short South Africa if you want, I don’t care. Just don’t spread doom-mongering and misinformation while you’re at it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll5wch/maybe_we_shouldnt_let_this_sub_turn_into_some/","title":"Maybe we SHOULDN’T let this sub turn into some moral battleground for political jerks.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-17T08:27:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-17 08:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ll5wch","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll5wch/maybe_we_shouldnt_let_this_sub_turn_into_some/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll5wch/maybe_we_shouldnt_let_this_sub_turn_into_some/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Stupid_yet_honest","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Stupid_yet_honest","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Stupid_yet_honest","score":1135,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"也许我们不应该让这个分论坛变成政治混蛋的道德战场。","the_new_excerpt":"所以。我们大多数人都看到了这个帖子\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkzviy/i_am_going_to_short_the_whole_country_of_south/?utm_source=share&amp；utm_medium=ios_app&amp；utm_name=iossmf]\n由一个想做空南非的疯子做的。它充满了大量的\n的错误信息量。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"也許我們不應該讓這個分論壇變成政治混蛋的道德戰場。","the_new_excerpt":"所以。我們大多數人都看到了這個帖子\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkzviy/i_am_going_to_short_the_whole_country_of_south/?utm_source=share&amp；utm_medium=ios_app&amp；utm_name=iossmf]\n由一個想做空南非的瘋子做的。它充滿了大量的\n的錯誤信息量。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ltexfi","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltexfi/first_week_of_february/","title":"First Week of February","date":"February 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"二月的第一个星期","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"二月的第一個星期","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26262038","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26262038","title":"Zluda: CUDA on Intel GPUs","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 27, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Zluda: 英特尔GPU上的CUDA","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Zluda: 英特爾GPU上的CUDA","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-ll5wch","previousId":"RedditPost-ltexfi","nextId":"HnPost-26262038","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll5wch/maybe_we_shouldnt_let_this_sub_turn_into_some/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
