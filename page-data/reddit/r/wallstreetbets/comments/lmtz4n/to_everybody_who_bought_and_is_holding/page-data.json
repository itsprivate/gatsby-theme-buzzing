You were <strong>NOT wrong</strong> for <strong>NOT selling</strong>. To where this was headed at the time, 483 and even 800 would have been a steal of a price. The CEO even said we were about to get catapulted into <strong>Andromeda</strong> reaching <strong>THOUSANDS</strong> per share had the rug not been pulled. It&#39;s evident they had to change the rules of the game but theyre on <strong>borrowed time</strong>. All they did was kick the time bomb down the road. The mechanics havent changed, everything is still in our favour. I guarantee you RC is watching the Congress Hearings and would have no problem holding an emergency shareholder meeting. As its been on the SECs failure to deliver for way too fucking long and especially in the face of no response to blatant corruption.</p>\n\n<p>Look no further than the strategically placed poster below of a cat <strong>HOLDING</strong>.
