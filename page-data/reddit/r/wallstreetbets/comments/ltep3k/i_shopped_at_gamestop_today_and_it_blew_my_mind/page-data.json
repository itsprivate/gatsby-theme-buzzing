BUT.... My visit made me rethink that gamestop really is doing better than I thought.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, this location had about 15 customers in there not including us. Two people bought switches, and three bought memberships before it got to our turn in line.</p>\n\n<p>But seriously, I&#39;m here to talk about the membership and how I could see it was causing serious loyalty. I haven&#39;t paid attention to thier membership in a while, so I was surprised to see that about 10 of the 15 people that were checked out before me said they wanted to use thier membership coupon, or wanted to sign up for the membership.</p>\n\n<p>When it came to be my turn in line, I had to ask. What&#39;s the membership do.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s 15 a year, and you get a 5 dollar discount coupon every month, including one that you could use right away that printed on the receipt. I shit you not, that all three people before me, and then me, went a took that instant 5 dollar coupon to go buy something else right away, leading me to actually spend $20 more than I intended on during my visit.</p>\n\n<p>I felt like I was getting a deal, but I also worked retail for years and know they probably more than made that 5 dollars back.</p>\n\n<p>But the thing that makes me the most hopeful, was the amount of customers that told the cashier they would see them next month.</p>\n\n<p>Granted, I live in a decently large city... But it really made it seem like they were not only keeping busy, but thier membership program change is working.</p>\n\n<p>I commented to the guy I thought the membership was only for games, and he said thankfully they had changed it for pretty much all the products in the store - realistically why I actually stop in the too look around even if I have games, to get my nerdy stuff.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: felt like the new membership program was 🔥, bought more than I expected, and saw what looked like a lot of customer loyalty.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltep3k/i_shopped_at_gamestop_today_and_it_blew_my_mind/","title":"I shopped at GameStop today and it blew my mind.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-27T15:36:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-27 15:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ltep3k","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltep3k/i_shopped_at_gamestop_today_and_it_blew_my_mind/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltep3k/i_shopped_at_gamestop_today_and_it_blew_my_mind/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"nrouns","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/nrouns","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"nrouns","score":4771,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我今天在GameStop购物，让我大吃一惊。","the_new_excerpt":"我和我的女朋友进了一家GameStop，所以她可以买她的普通小\n宠物小精灵小饰品和T恤....。但是.... 我的访问让我重新思考\ngamestop真的比我想象的要好。\n\n首先，这个地点有大约15个顾客在那里，不包括我们。\n有两个人买了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我今天在GameStop購物，讓我大喫一驚。","the_new_excerpt":"我和我的女朋友進了一家GameStop，所以她可以買她的普通小\n寵物小精靈小飾品和T恤....。但是.... 我的訪問讓我重新思考\ngamestop真的比我想象的要好。\n\n首先，這個地點有大約15個顧客在那裏，不包括我們。\n有兩個人買了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ltoikn","excerpt":"Illegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's deep,\ndark secrets.
