People who are downvoted get their posts and comments hidden and eventually get muted, and Karma does motivate people to seek upvotes. The best examples are how <a href=\"/r/politics\">r/politics</a> become completely blue dominated with no alternative views, or people will post things on <a href=\"/r/nottheonion\">r/nottheonion</a> and the comments get dominated as if it is <a href=\"/r/politics\">r/politics</a>. Alongside this, you see a gradual reduction in nuance, which in <a href=\"/r/politics\">r/politics</a> became &quot;mango bad&quot;.  You see this throughout other subs on non-political topics once a tribal identity forms, and there is a strong tribal narrative on one side of an issue, and then people passionately downvote anything not in agreement.</p>\n\n<p>On WSB, the mods banned political comments to prevent this kind of tribal BS seeping into the sub. But, we are starting to get extremely tribal about specific meme stocks to the point where it&#39;s very difficult to get quality DD on the other end of the issue. An awful lot of top posts do not have humor value as memes, and are basically - &lt;ticker I YOLOed my entire account into&gt;  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀  followed by trash talk about some skeptic somewhere. I feel like arguing with people about a hot ticker now is like arguing with an anti-vaxxer friend about Moderna, or a blue friend about Mango&#39;s actual governmental actions, or a red friend about vote counting. It&#39;s really hard to be constructive or for anyone to get smarter.</p>\n\n<p>If the goal of this sub is to collectively pump particular stocks, I guess this is true to form, but if the goal of this sub includes discussion to inform better trading outcomes for participants, this dynamic is greatly reducing the quality of trading discussion. Right now, the feed is almost exclusively just two tickers, and those threads have very few contrary views, even well thought out ones. When well thought-out comments are added that are not rockets and buy buy buy and either correct inaccuracies in the post or provide a reasoned alternative perspective, they get downvoted out of visibility. Even 4 or 5 months ago, I felt this sub was a lot different than stocktwits, but it&#39;s hard to tell the difference sometimes now.  I really want to be part of a community where we consistently find insight and trades that everyone else thought was dumb but was in reality brilliant, and that holds up some time later. The GME value thesis at $5 is one of those. So too was BTFDing the pandemic, and shorting it too.</p>\n\n<p>I think this current tribalism is going to lead to worse trading outcomes for the sub in the long run. When we front-run a big wave of increasing bid on a stock, and then that price becomes stable or we exit before it&#39;s not, we outperform the market. That happened big time last year with Coronavirus, and has happened repeatedly with TSLA. In other cases we try to forget, it&#39;s been the opposite, like multiple times ahead of AMD earnings, PRPL, and over-exuberance with PLTR into the 30s. Basically, if we pump the stock, and then the broader community of investors doesn&#39;t come around to the point of view, we are stuck with the bag. And a lot of these outcomes come from when we are all-in and super emotional about it, which I think we all know is NOT how to trade if you want the best results.</p>\n\n<p>We should stop downvoting posts and comments that are well written, and instead leave them alone or up vote them. By all means, downvote bullshit troll posts and straight up haters, but if you downvote quality contrary views, you make everyone here a worse trader, and increase the echo chamber that leads the sub to over-extend.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l233ze/groupthink_and_tribalism_on_wsb/","title":"Groupthink and Tribalism on WSB","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-22T01:31:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-22 01:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l233ze","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l233ze/groupthink_and_tribalism_on_wsb/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l233ze/groupthink_and_tribalism_on_wsb/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Unlucky-Prize","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Unlucky-Prize","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Unlucky-Prize","score":2337,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"WSB上的群体思维和部落主义。","the_new_excerpt":"Reddit有一种成为回声室的冲动，因为上票和下票的方式。\n降权机制的工作。被降权的人的帖子和评论都会被降权\n隐蔽，最终被静音，而Karma确实会促使人们寻求上票。\n最好的例子就是r/politics[/r/politics]是如何成为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"WSB上的羣體思維和部落主義。","the_new_excerpt":"Reddit有一種成爲回聲室的衝動，因爲上票和下票的方式。\n降權機制的工作。被降權的人的帖子和評論都會被降權\n隱蔽，最終被靜音，而Karma確實會促使人們尋求上票。\n最好的例子就是r/politics[/r/politics]是如何成爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l8nntv","excerpt":"Honestly, I didn’t want to post this myself since there’s probably two dozen of\nthese posts in the queue, but all of the recent ones look like they’re written\nby 8 year olds.\n\nNormally this belongs in the daily advice thread, but because of recent events\nand concerns over Robinhood’s ability to…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l8nntv/by_popular_demand_official_i_hate_robinhood_and/","title":"By popular demand: official “I hate Robinhood and want a new broker thread”","date":"January 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"应大众要求：官方 \"我讨厌Robinhood，想要一个新的经纪人线\"","the_new_excerpt":"说实话，我自己也不想发这个帖子，因为可能有二十几个人的\n这些帖子在队列中，但所有最近的帖子看起来像他们写的。\n由8岁的孩子。\n\n通常这属于日常咨询主题，但由于最近发生的事件。\n以及对Robinhood能力的担忧... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"應大衆要求：官方 \"我討厭Robinhood，想要一個新的經紀人線\"","the_new_excerpt":"說實話，我自己也不想發這個帖子，因爲可能有二十幾個人的\n這些帖子在隊列中，但所有最近的帖子看起來像他們寫的。\n由8歲的孩子。\n\n通常這屬於日常諮詢主題，但由於最近發生的事件。\n以及對Robinhood能力的擔憂... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-25968348","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25968348","title":"Offline Algorithms in Low-Frequency Trading","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 30, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"低频交易的离线算法","locale":"zh"},{"title":"低頻交易的離線算法","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l233ze","previousId":"RedditPost-l8nntv","nextId":"HnPost-25968348","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l233ze/groupthink_and_tribalism_on_wsb/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
