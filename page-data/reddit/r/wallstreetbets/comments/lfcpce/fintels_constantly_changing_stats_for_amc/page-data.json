Even with all the weird movements this past week, I would not like to shout &quot;market manipulation&quot; until I&#39;m completely sure there&#39;s something going on. Ironically, all this shady changes have been happening right before dissemination day (02/09/2021).</p>\n\n<p>The first one I would like to point one is the one that makes the most sense to me:</p>\n\n<p>My screenshot (02/05/2021):</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gwr0w2lvc9g61.jpg?width=1072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=392713765e7e5e6c8cec78f82f99d3392fae8537\">https://preview.redd.it/gwr0w2lvc9g61.jpg?width=1072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=392713765e7e5e6c8cec78f82f99d3392fae8537</a></p>\n\n<p>Current report (02/08/2021):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hvnht9yhc9g61.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ab31267f7f33bdc74c9699772479fd76eb75165\">https://preview.redd.it/hvnht9yhc9g61.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ab31267f7f33bdc74c9699772479fd76eb75165</a></p>\n\n<p>The short volume ratio dropped drastically (twice). The second time it dropped is what you can see in the second image - i.e. the current report on Fintel. For the first drop, unfortunately, I don&#39;t have an image to prove it. But, what I do remember is that for the 3rd of February the percentage was 53% rather than 27%.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, what you can notice is that there is a noticeable change. This one I&#39;m willing to blame on &quot;updating data&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I presume short volume is not as simple to track as most of us believe and there is probably a large number of elements that can either spoof a system into believe that the numbers are much higher.</p>\n\n<p>However, one thing that we can notice is (if this were true) how often Fintel updates their stats. My screenshot was on the 5th of Feb, and the current one (8th of Feb). This shows that Fintel has updated their stats twice in the span of 3/4 days.</p>\n\n<p>Right, where things start to get fishy is when we look at the historical values of short volume over the past year.</p>\n\n<p>My screenshot (02/06/2021):</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i3rvnszod9g61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fedd7c75866d3ab465921e3bc05653c1bb2e5525\">https://preview.redd.it/i3rvnszod9g61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fedd7c75866d3ab465921e3bc05653c1bb2e5525</a></p>\n\n<p>Current report (02/08/2021):</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/db9kfb9td9g61.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71a375b65bb788662f32484b88948b8541e5a6be\">https://preview.redd.it/db9kfb9td9g61.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71a375b65bb788662f32484b88948b8541e5a6be</a></p>\n\n<p>As you can see the first screenshot I had taken shows that during there was a higher short volume in February compared to prior months. This was after the first correction that I had mentioned previously (the one I don&#39;t have a screenshot for).</p>\n\n<p>In April of 2020, in the first screenshot the average short volume was recorded to be about 45% and now it&#39;s showing it to be above 85%. And February of 2021 is showing to be one of the lowest short volumes.</p>\n\n<p>I get the short volume being updated regularly for day values. But for historical data? Especially with such a huge change? And all of this came out a few days before dissemination day?</p>\n\n<p>There was a person on Stocktwits who claimed that he got his subscription cancelled, automatically, after reaching out to Fintel to ask them why are their numbers changing so rapidly and so often.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h70kkdddi9g61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec69d680ef52115d62735a2c9d0b0c89313b9b4e\">https://preview.redd.it/h70kkdddi9g61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec69d680ef52115d62735a2c9d0b0c89313b9b4e</a></p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the email he received.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/illgtdpdi9g61.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea342f304ba9003f3b9bce2d6fc7b24a74067061\">https://preview.redd.it/illgtdpdi9g61.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea342f304ba9003f3b9bce2d6fc7b24a74067061</a></p>\n\n<p>Again, there might be a lot more complexities behind short volume calculations. But all of this seems like more than a coincidence.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>P.S I&#39;m not a financial advisor just a smooth brained ape who doesn&#39;t like what he sees.</p>\n\n<p>P.S.P.S I&#39;m still holding strong!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: A lot of people were asking what does this mean. It doesn&#39;t mean anything per se. It just shows that there is some odd movement happening with Fintel&#39;s platform. One of the top comments pointed out a conversation he had with Fintel:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern! You are right. Given the recent market activity we wanted to implement more data sources as a check, to gain a richer overview of stocks. Given this, we have revised some historical numbers. We announced this in the Welcome Group and on those pages. Sorry the message wasn’t up for longer - I imagine that was super confusing. We will replace it again. I imagine many subscribers did get to see it.</p>\n\n<p>Are you certain the chart isn’t updating? That is an automated process. I appreciate you writing in so I could clarify. I’ll resolve your ticket but I’m still here if you reply.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I mean, this is possible. However, why now? Why after a year do they decide to go ahead an say &quot;oh yeah, let&#39;s update these statistics so we can show more &quot;accurate&quot; measurements to our users&quot;. Ya know?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Also, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel: Borrowing fees for AMC went up by 1% (currently sitting at 4.47% from the previous 3.5%. Usually an increase means that more people are borrowing shares to short.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit X2:</strong> A fellow ape showed me that someone else over at the <a href=\"/r/RubinoffButtChug69\">r/RubinoffButtChug69</a> made a similar speculation.</p>\n\n<p>His post (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">link</a>) also points out that <strong>Apple&#39;s stock has not been effected by any of this.</strong></p>\n\n<p>And for all of you <strong>asking about GME - the same post points out that GME also suffered from this. It&#39;s short volume got lowered by 50%.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfcpce/fintels_constantly_changing_stats_for_amc/","title":"Fintel's constantly changing stats for AMC","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-08T18:42:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-08 18:42","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lfcpce","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfcpce/fintels_constantly_changing_stats_for_amc/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfcpce/fintels_constantly_changing_stats_for_amc/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/N80rvB-ozf3GCoTiaILTolhkTMYgmHFFuJwDUI3cjlU.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d932c29b03f9ee52183fe442a7a05b50571ab2e9","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Zanko95","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zanko95","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Zanko95","score":3655,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Fintel为AMC不断变化的统计数据","the_new_excerpt":"我关注fintel的报告已经有一段时间了，在我知道之前就已经开始了。\n关于AMC和GME。\n\n他们的报告一直很准确，但最近我注意到一些\n的黑幕活动，让我眉头一皱。\n\n先声明，我本人通常不是一个阴谋论者。即使有这么多...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Fintel爲AMC不斷變化的統計數據","the_new_excerpt":"我關注fintel的報告已經有一段時間了，在我知道之前就已經開始了。\n關於AMC和GME。\n\n他們的報告一直很準確，但最近我注意到一些\n的黑幕活動，讓我眉頭一皺。\n\n先聲明，我本人通常不是一個陰謀論者。即使有這麼多...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1362424687452708864","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1362424687452708864","title":"Gonna tell my kids this was a bear market. https://t.co/CD4VVTrkIs","date":"February 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"要告诉我的孩子这是一个熊市。https://t.co/CD4VVTrkIs。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"要告訴我的孩子這是一個熊市。https://t.co/CD4VVTrkIs。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26177619","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26177619","title":"How NASA Designed a Helicopter That Could Fly Autonomously on Mars","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 18, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"美国宇航局如何设计出能在火星上自主飞行的直升机？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國宇航局如何設計出能在火星上自主飛行的直升機？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lfcpce","previousId":"TweetPost-1362424687452708864","nextId":"HnPost-26177619","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfcpce/fintels_constantly_changing_stats_for_amc/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
