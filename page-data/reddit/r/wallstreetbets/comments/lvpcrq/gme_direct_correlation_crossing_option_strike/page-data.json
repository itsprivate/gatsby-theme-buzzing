Track your MA&#39;s and MACD all you want, but unless you&#39;re day trading that ain&#39;t doing shit to tell this story right now. Today I&#39;ve seen a whole new wave of people dropping pure misinformation and demonstrating an overall lack of understanding in the most basic of trading knowledge (people excited that calls expired ITM on a Monday... I&#39;m looking at you). Instead of shunning these people away or. making them feel dumb, I wanted to take an abstract look at how this general idea could actually be a positive indicator.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know shit about finance or anything along those lines, but I like looking at numbers. If you like numbers, this is for you. If you&#39;re looking for advice... I have none to offer at all.</p>\n\n<p>So anyway... most people are in general agreement that the spike last week has covered by MM delta hedging. The price movement started right when the price hit $55:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pnhp2zkjeik61.png?width=835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1308265360d3f9fea21087dd6c04df4e4f12fe7\">https://preview.redd.it/pnhp2zkjeik61.png?width=835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1308265360d3f9fea21087dd6c04df4e4f12fe7</a></p>\n\n<p>Looking at the options chain last week (keep in mind, these numbers were taken right before close and will exclude any contracts exercised prior), there were a total of 18,610 contracts ITM at $55, or 1,861,000 shares. The volume in the proceeding 5 minutes jumped to over 4,000,000 shares.</p>\n\n<p>The movement that lead up to closing saw the price touch $90. Looking at the open interest of contracts with strikes of $56 to $90, we have an additional 22,148 contract ITM (2,214,800 shares). The next candle following this trigger jumped to a volume of 18,000,000. Looking at the chart, this pattern continues with a larger-than-normal spike following each new milestone/strike price (until Friday, that is). Although a good portion of the volume was renewed hype and FOMO (with some institutional assistance al a Bruce&#39;s thesis), this is a steady pattern that indicates hedging of some degree on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>Now the fun part you smooth brains have been waiting for. Today, we saw similar action at $120 - once it held on the candle for a moment, there was an immediate spike to &gt;2m in volume. At $120, there are 29,960 contracts ITM (2.9m shares).</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the data from last week and this week, we see that those spikes correlate directly to the number of ITM contracts, using 2/24 as an example:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/47fops6seik61.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99e443a21e5f186dc6b2bc30e63d98b6e83ccd04\">https://preview.redd.it/47fops6seik61.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99e443a21e5f186dc6b2bc30e63d98b6e83ccd04</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll admit, this is very speculative. Although it is data driven, the sample size is too small and my patience is too thin. But using these jumps as a point of reference... we may know where to expect algo driven volume...</p>\n\n<p>To recap real quick, with today&#39;s close at $120 there are 29,960 weekly contracts ITM. You&#39;ll notice these spikes correlated with 3000+ jumps in ITM open interest, meaning we&#39;d see a spike if we cross $125 heading to $130... <strong>OH. WAIT. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Crossing this strike price directly corresponds with the jump in volume from 680k to 2.8m (again)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cspssj72fik61.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d1be76bb8607d752917c8ae8ec9129ce11cd461\">https://preview.redd.it/cspssj72fik61.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d1be76bb8607d752917c8ae8ec9129ce11cd461</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/b5t30f9yeik61.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd3ddd5af45d46eb565b32f6f0f8bfa20a67214e\">https://preview.redd.it/b5t30f9yeik61.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd3ddd5af45d46eb565b32f6f0f8bfa20a67214e</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>This means the next algo-driven hedging will happen on a small scale from $135-$145</strong> (where there are an addition ~2000 contracts)... however, <strong>THIS WILL PUSH IT TO $150</strong>. At $150, there are another 4,000 contracts that would be ITM. Using the very smooth brained math from our table above, this would give us a 150-200% boost in volume as the $150&#39;s are hedged. Keep in mind, we&#39;ll already be at higher volume from the $140 run, so that moment will be something to behold.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> MY THEORY: Organically reaching new ITM strikes causes algo based hedging and an immediate spike in volume proportionate to the number of new ITM calls. Also, the domino theory is correct - based on hedging volume surrounding additional ITM options, breaking $140 should propel it to $150 which will be like dropping a match in a puddle of rocket fuel.</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t actual DD. Just my ADHD medication making me sexually attracted to numbers, and it helps when people watch.</p>\n\n<p>Edit- spelling</p>\n\n<p>ETA - I think this reflects a change in strategy overall. While this could still overlap with what some call a gamma squeeze (t+2 covering of the previous week’s ITM calls), I think they are hedging up front more aggressively... giving us Delta Squeezes instead.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvpcrq/gme_direct_correlation_crossing_option_strike/","title":"GME Direct Correlation: Crossing Option Strike Price and Immediate followup volume","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-02T13:06:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-02 13:06","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lvpcrq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvpcrq/gme_direct_correlation_crossing_option_strike/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvpcrq/gme_direct_correlation_crossing_option_strike/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/gZljn3e-CS_TQEHs-AhWlOV3pCr0AX0DMBjmKLz5low.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=436f05353f7b6eaadd45194c24a4c1ae9b2c52d0","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"afreshstart20","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/afreshstart20","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"afreshstart20","score":2797,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME直接相关。交叉期权行使价与即时跟进量的关系","the_new_excerpt":"我们都同意，大多数技术性的东西都被淘汰了。追踪你的MA和\nMACD是你想要的，但除非你是日内交易，否则什么都不用说了\n这个故事现在。今天，我已经看到了一个全新的浪潮，人们滴纯粹的\n误导，并显示出整体缺乏... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME直接相關。交叉期權行使價與即時跟進量的關係","the_new_excerpt":"我們都同意，大多數技術性的東西都被淘汰了。追蹤你的MA和\nMACD是你想要的，但除非你是日內交易，否則什麼都不用說了\n這個故事現在。今天，我已經看到了一個全新的浪潮，人們滴純粹的\n誤導，並顯示出整體缺乏... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26434032","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26434032","title":"On the death of my family's dairy farm (2019)","date":"March 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"关于我家奶牛场的死亡（2019年）。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於我家奶牛場的死亡（2019年）。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26423000","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26423000","title":"From Vim to Emacs in fourteen days (2015)","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 12, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"从Vim到Emacs的十四天（2015年","locale":"zh"},{"title":"從Vim到Emacs的十四天（2015年","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lvpcrq","previousId":"HnPost-26434032","nextId":"HnPost-26423000","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvpcrq/gme_direct_correlation_crossing_option_strike/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
