This is part 1 of a series aimed at helping you guys have a fighting chance against wallstreet. Remember you are going against the sharpest minds in the world and you will lose. But you have me in your corner and im rooting for you guys, I believe in you</p>\n\n<p>Volume</p>\n\n<p>-A trend that moves on steady volume means that its likely to continue aka price is rising or price is lowering</p>\n\n<p>-Falling volume means that a trend is likely to reverse, whether price is going up or down, it applies to both</p>\n\n<p>-A burst of extremely high volume means that its trend is likely to reverse. Usually when the stock reaches its peak or when all of a sudden it crashes, keep your eye on the volume</p>\n\n<p>-If there is Low volume and the price stays the same, it usually means thats this is the new normal price. People are unfazed by slight price changes here, this is the new normal</p>\n\n<p>-A second price breakout after one just occured is usually marked by yet another high volume spike. It usually means losers are heading for the exit because theyve been bag holding and cant take the pain anymore or bulls are jumping back in</p>\n\n<p>-a price breakout in low volume means that its fake, the price will recoil</p>\n\n<p>-rising volume during a rally(after a stock crashed)means that even though the bagholders are leaving, new losers are coming in</p>\n\n<p>-When volume shrinks during a rally, it means that bulls arent as eager to keep buying at these high prices. Fuel is being removed from this ship. A reversal is imminent </p>\n\n<p>-When volume dries up during a decline, it usually means a reversal. That is the bears are no longer shorting and the intelligent bulls who got out a long time ago are ready to pounce yet again</p>\n\n<p>-As a rule of thumb, if todays volume is higher than yesterday’s, it means that a trend is likely to continue </p>\n\n<p>-Volume is relative, what is high for ibm may be low for apple. What is low for apple may be high for ibm</p>\n\n<p>-As a rule of thumb, high volume is 25% higher than the avg volume of the past 2 weeks and low volume is 25% lower than the avg volume of the past 2 week</p>\n\n<p>-High volume confirms new trends. If prices rise to a new peak, and volume reaches a new high, then prices are likely to retest, that is go below the peak and come back to the peak to see if it can exceed it or go back down.</p>\n\n<p>-If a stock falls to a new low, and volume reaches a new high then that bottom will also retest- that is go up and come back down to that bottom to see if it goes even lower or stays there</p>\n\n<p>-the true bottom of a stock occurs on low volume and is always retested at low volume. If it stays the same then this is a great buying opportunity </p>\n\n<p>-if volume shrinks during an upwards or downwards trend then that trend is ripe for a reversal </p>\n\n<p>-When a stock reaches a new peak than it was yesterday, but the volume is lower today than yesterday- this is a great shorting opportunity, that is: Now is the time to sell or time to buy puts</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This does not work on a downwards trend as a stock can keep going down even with low volume. It takes buying to move a stock up, but a stock can go down on its own weight</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>-Watch volume during a reaction against the upward trend(aka panic selling). If the dip continues but volume shrinks, it means bulls are no longer running or selling pressure is spent. When the explosion of selling volume dries up, then it means that the upwards trend will resume. This presents a good buying opportunity or to buy calls</p>\n\n<p>-Many downtrends are punctuated(occurs at intervals) by rallies(price goes up momentarily)which begin on heavy volume. These shake out weak bears which causes volume to shrink and gives a signal to sell short~ this means that short sellers are now sure that the stock will crater because no more rallies</p>\n\n<p>:thanks for the love. I just want to help people\n:but i feel that the Reddit users with flair despise me because im teaching yall. So i want to level the playing field as flair helps you get taken more serious here. Ive asked the wsb mods for flair so i can reach a wider audience. If you guys want to help me out i ask that you mssg the mods and ask yhem to give me flair so i will get taken more serious by retail\nTy love you all</p>\n\n<p>Edit2\nTomorrow stay tuned for my part 2, open interest and so forth for this week to complete the picture and arm you lovable losers with a complete straitjacket so you can swing your big cocks and tits at wallstreet. I am the most hated person here by most users with flair because they want to keep you ignorant. Youre just paper to them, not human beings.\nLets show them how paper can become money.......airplanes.......and eventually soar</p>\n\n<p>Fly like an eagle🎶</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpq5v1/volume_the_final_frontier_and_why_itll_help_you/","title":"Volume the final frontier and why itll help you make money","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T00:56:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 00:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lpq5v1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpq5v1/volume_the_final_frontier_and_why_itll_help_you/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpq5v1/volume_the_final_frontier_and_why_itll_help_you/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"TonyMontanaIsNice","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TonyMontanaIsNice","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"TonyMontanaIsNice","score":3082,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"卷最后的边界，为什么它会帮助你赚钱。","the_new_excerpt":"我做这个是为了帮助你们这些不懂股票的新手。这是第一部分\n一个系列旨在帮助你们有一个战斗的机会 对华尔街。\n记住，你们要对抗的是世界上最敏锐的头脑，而你们将... ...\n输了。但你有我在你的角落，我支持你的家伙，... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"卷最後的邊界，爲什麼它會幫助你賺錢。","the_new_excerpt":"我做這個是爲了幫助你們這些不懂股票的新手。這是第一部分\n一個系列旨在幫助你們有一個戰鬥的機會 對華爾街。\n記住，你們要對抗的是世界上最敏銳的頭腦，而你們將... ...\n輸了。但你有我在你的角落，我支持你的傢伙，... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26341295","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26341295","title":"We Expect 300k Fewer Births Than Usual This Year in the US","date":"March 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"我们预计今年美国的出生人数将比往年减少30万。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們預計今年美國的出生人數將比往年減少30萬。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26344739","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26344739","title":"Apple now lets you transfer your iCloud Photos to Google Photos","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 04, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"苹果现在可以让你把iCloud照片传输到谷歌照片上","locale":"zh"},{"title":"蘋果現在可以讓你把iCloud照片傳輸到谷歌照片上","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lpq5v1","previousId":"HnPost-26341295","nextId":"HnPost-26344739","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpq5v1/volume_the_final_frontier_and_why_itll_help_you/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
