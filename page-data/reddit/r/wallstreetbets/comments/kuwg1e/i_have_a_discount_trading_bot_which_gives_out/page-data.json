I’ll be giving daily updates for it.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: My goal is to do 400 successful trades with minimum losses before I say everything perfect.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 4: I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. </p>\n\n<p>Edit 5: Hahaha but really you guys who did the 13 upvotes have made my day! I’m happy I’m helping you guys out.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 6: Holy I made it to 50 votes, you guys are honestly the best. I didn’t even realise this would help this many people but honestly thank you. I will not fail you.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 7: No I don’t have a paid site where you can get this data. Please do not sell this data to anyone it’s free information. I know there’s discord/telegram admin of paid groups who would try and monetise it. Please do not.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 8: Over 100 people have seen this, I feel like it’s my birthday. I love you guys. I just want everyone to be well off and have money.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 9: 168 upvotes I just can’t imagine I would’ve ever got this, you guys are amazing. But please just invest in companies you know and are confident about. That’s all I ask, I’m waiting for a big tech company to be discounted enough to show up that’s where I would drop 20-40k into it. Only invest in the things you are personally confident about. I’ll be posting this everyday, stocks are a waiting game keep in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 10: 200 UPVOTES WHAT THATS CRAZY!!!  Thank you so much for all the awards, you guys really don’t have to, please spend that money on stocks and such. It’s very expensive.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 11: 453 upvotes I just don’t know what to say you guys are amazing I’m trying to perfect everything for you guys, but please don’t rush to do trades everyday only trades which you are confident on. Thank you WSB I will be a loyal member to the community.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 12: I just ate and came back and it’s almost at a thousand. You guys have just made my day especially the upvotes and awards which I given. You guys are the absolute best and I don’t know what I’d do without you. Please read my messages above carefully. I don’t want you guys to lose money and PLEASEEE AWARDS ARE EXPENSIVE DONT WASTE MONEY ON ME PUT IT TOWARDS STOCKS INSTEAD HAHAHA BUT HONESTLY THANK YOU GUYS.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i_have_a_discount_trading_bot_which_gives_out/","title":"I have a discount trading bot which gives out daily (well hourly discounts for the stock market).
