This sub has gone from YOLOing everything you have into GOEV and losing it, posting the loss porn, and taking your losses like a man to essentially an insider trading, mass manipulation mission where the retard levels get so dense it creates a black hole of autism that causes people to dump their grocery money on the early peak of a squeeze.
