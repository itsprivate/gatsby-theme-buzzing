I think this is the only new years resolution I managed to do properly. Anyway this subreddit played a major role in making me rekindle my relationship with books. So I just wanted to share my joy with you guys. I know I don&#39;t post a lot here, but I assure you I am an avid lurker here.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the books I read last year. I am not going to list the books which are in my mother tongue, so the number wouldn&#39;t be 30, just so you know.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49857819-devil-s-advocate\">Devil&#39;s Advocate: The Untold Story</a>: Loved it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30370821-ego-is-the-enemy\">Ego is the Enemy: The Fight to Master Our Greatest Opponent</a>: Loved it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24874448-lost-japan\">Lost Japan</a>: Didn&#39;t love it, didn&#39;t hate it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17971836-total-recall\">Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story</a>: Loved it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24145970-think-and-grow-rich\">Think and Grow Rich</a>: Didn&#39;t love it, didn&#39;t hate it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33295239-ikigai\">Ikigai: The Japanese secret to a long and happy life</a>: Didn&#39;t love it, didn&#39;t hate it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11205329-team-of-rivals\">Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln</a>: Loved it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/818560.A_Brief_History_Of_Time\">A Brief History Of Time: From the Big Bang To Black Holes</a>: Hated it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21265570-the-obstacle-is-the-way\">The Obstacle is the Way: The Ancient Art of Turning Adversity to Advantage</a>: Loved it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35610833-into-the-water\">Into the Water</a>: Didn&#39;t love it, didn&#39;t hate it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53362461-the-48-laws-of-power\">The 48 Laws of Power</a>: Didn&#39;t love it, didn&#39;t hate it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33561480-1984\">1984</a>: Loved it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28243272-faster-than-lightning\">Faster than Lightning: My Story</a>: Didn&#39;t love it, didn&#39;t hate it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23346740-sapiens\">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</a>: Loved it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31547753-the-wright-brothers\">The Wright Brothers</a>: Loved it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17125767-wild\">Wild: A Journey from Lost to Found</a>: Didn&#39;t love it, didn&#39;t hate it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33775814-born-a-crime\">Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood</a>: Didn&#39;t love it, didn&#39;t hate it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38312640-as-a-man-thinketh\">As a man thinketh</a>: Loved it, can&#39;t recommend it enough</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31752282-shoe-dog\">Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike</a>: Loved it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17304997-man-s-search-for-meaning\">Man&#39;s Search for Meaning</a>: Loved it, can&#39;t recommend it enough</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16099819-the-art-of-war\">The Art of War</a>: Loved it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29216557-buried-thoughts\">Buried Thoughts</a>: Didn&#39;t love it, didn&#39;t hate it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17707607-parenting-from-the-inside-out\">Parenting from the Inside Out: How a Deeper Self-Understanding Can Help You Raise Children Who Thrive</a>: Loved it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/634583.Wings_of_Fire\">Wings of Fire: An Autobiography</a>: Hated it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28510664-the-prince\">The Prince (Translated and Annoted by W.K Marriott)</a>: Hated it</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36640169-think-straight\">THINK STRAIGHT: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Life</a>: Didn&#39;t love it, didn&#39;t hate it</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All these books made me a better person and as a result I started making more and more right decisions in my life.
