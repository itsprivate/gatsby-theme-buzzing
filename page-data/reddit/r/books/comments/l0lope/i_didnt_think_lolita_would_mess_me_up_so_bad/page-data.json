I knew it was about a sick, evil man &quot;falling in love&quot; with a little girl and taking advantage of her after her mother dies. But I think going into the book with this knowledge actually made it MORE difficult to come to terms with. </p>\n\n<p>I hated Humbert. He&#39;s evil, he&#39;s deranged, and I wanted to feel happy when he died. But I couldn&#39;t. When he killed Clare Quilty and drove recklessly, covered in his blood, so detached from anything, I cried. I hate Humbert, and the book was so wonderfully written that I actually empathized with him, and I was lowkey disgusted with myself for it. I know he&#39;s the epitome of an unreliable narrator and that he spends the duration of his confession lying to himself and the reader, but I actually caught myself feeling sorry for him. He&#39;s a deranged man, destroyed by an obsession that drove him to destroy the lives of others. </p>\n\n<p>But then I realized... I was falling for Humbert&#39;s trap. That is what Humbert WANTED me to feel. He made me feel his suffering, his fear, his pain so deeply that I nearly forgot about Dolores, the real victim of the story. He destroyed her. He completely destroyed her and I was almost too blinded by Humbert&#39;s misery to see it, and yet it&#39;s plain as day. When he was killing Clare, I caught myself feeling like Humbert was a man, hopelessly in love, destroyed by that love, and he had that love torn from him and was left with nothing. Humbert wanted the reader to feel that way. </p>\n\n<p>Humbert didn&#39;t love Dolores. He loved the idea of her. He was so obsessed with his sick idea of &quot;nymphets&quot; that he completely forgot that they were just kids. He was so obsessed with Dolores, put her on such a high pedestal that he completely forgot that she was a person, a HUMAN BEING who he utterly destroyed. And I was so blinded by the tale of a man losing himself in insanity, to the point where I was crying because I FELT SORRY for this miserable sack of shit, that I too forgot for a moment that Dolores was a person, a child, and she was the one who was actually the victim in all of this. That probably sounds insane to anyone who hasn&#39;t read the book and that&#39;s because it is. Dolores lost her mother, her friends, her innocence, her WHOLE LIFE and it was old poor Humbert that I caught myself crying for. </p>\n\n<p>Vladimir Nabokov, you brilliant bastard.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l0lope/i_didnt_think_lolita_would_mess_me_up_so_bad/","title":"I didn't think Lolita would mess me up so bad.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T03:12:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 03:12","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ef312486-b82f-596b-9eba-ef02d8ea74c1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l0lope/i_didnt_think_lolita_would_mess_me_up_so_bad/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l0lope/i_didnt_think_lolita_would_mess_me_up_so_bad/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"maxchloerachel","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/maxchloerachel","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"maxchloerachel","score":9874,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我没想到洛丽塔会把我搞得这么惨。","the_new_excerpt":"对不起，如果不允许发关于一本书如何让我哭泣的文章，但耶稣\n老天爷\n\n我知道什么是洛丽塔之前，我读它。我知道它是关于一个病态的，邪恶的人。\n\"爱上 \"一个小女孩，并在她之后占她的便宜。\n母亲死了。但我认为进入这本书的时候... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我沒想到洛麗塔會把我搞得這麼慘。","the_new_excerpt":"對不起，如果不允許發關於一本書如何讓我哭泣的文章，但耶穌\n老天爺\n\n我知道什麼是洛麗塔之前，我讀它。我知道它是關於一個病態的，邪惡的人。\n\"愛上 \"一個小女孩，並在她之後佔她的便宜。\n母親死了。但我認爲進入這本書的時候... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-70f7f7ca-88e7-5eba-94ed-8246901f25be","excerpt":"It's frightening!
