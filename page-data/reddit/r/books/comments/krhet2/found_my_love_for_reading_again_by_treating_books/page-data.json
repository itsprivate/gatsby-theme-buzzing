I continually set this goal for myself but never follow through as I find I get bored pretty easily and need to switch my focus. Because of this, it’s been hard for me to get through a book entirely. </p>\n\n<p>On January 1st, I picked up one of the books I got for Christmas. As usual, I started to lose focus and put it down but the thought of reading was stuck in my head so I opened up GoodReads and the Books app on my phone to find some new ones that interested me. What ended up happening is I downloaded a couple e-books and started reading. When I got bored I switched to the other. Later on I picked up that first book. Since then I’ve found that by continuously switching between a few books, I am more engaged and interested in what I’m reading. I do the same with social media, constantly switching back and forth between a few apps all day. Now I’m doing it with books. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve already finished a couple, getting close on a few more, and best of all, my screen time shows around 3 hours of reading rather than 3 hours on social media. I’m excited to figure out this system that works for me and I’m looking forward to leveraging it more this year. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve decided on a rotation of fiction, non-fiction/educational, and self help. If anyone has any recommendations I’d love to hear them!</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: using my short attention span to read 3 books at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: This blew up way more than expected. Woke up with hundreds of comments. Thank you all for the awards and I’ll be going through and trying to read everything. Glad to finally feel like part of this community.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/krhet2/found_my_love_for_reading_again_by_treating_books/","title":"Found my love for reading again by treating books like I do social media.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T03:12:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 03:12","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"79d54591-727b-5522-8c63-883266951d04","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/krhet2/found_my_love_for_reading_again_by_treating_books/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/krhet2/found_my_love_for_reading_again_by_treating_books/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"micro435","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/micro435","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"micro435","score":6548,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"像对待社交媒体一样对待书籍，重新找到了我对阅读的热爱。","the_new_excerpt":"我的新年决心之一就是要多读书。我不断为自己设定这个目标\n自己，但从来没有贯彻执行，因为我发现我很容易感到厌倦，需要。\n转移我的注意力。正因为如此，我很难看完一本书。\n完全是。\n\n1月1日，我拿起我得到的一本书... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"像對待社交媒體一樣對待書籍，重新找到了我對閱讀的熱愛。","the_new_excerpt":"我的新年決心之一就是要多讀書。我不斷爲自己設定這個目標\n自己，但從來沒有貫徹執行，因爲我發現我很容易感到厭倦，需要。\n轉移我的注意力。正因爲如此，我很難看完一本書。\n完全是。\n\n1月1日，我拿起我得到的一本書... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-683ff14c-d8f0-50fd-ab9f-b411892bb7c0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/kzy8ks/hundreds_of_writers_and_book_agents_sign_joint/","title":"Hundreds of writers and book agents sign joint letter demanding publishing industry bans Trump memoir","date":"January 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"数百名作家和图书代理商签署联名信，要求出版业禁用特朗普回忆录。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"數百名作家和圖書代理商簽署聯名信，要求出版業禁用特朗普回憶錄。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-6c01d8fd-4d07-55a3-bde6-b3740922a4e4","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/kl5uvb/for_independent_booksellers_the_pandemic_has_been/","title":"For independent booksellers, the pandemic has been an unexpected boon","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 26, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"对于独立书商来说，这种流行病是一个意外的利好。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"對於獨立書商來說，這種流行病是一個意外的利好。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-79d54591-727b-5522-8c63-883266951d04","previousId":"RedditPost-683ff14c-d8f0-50fd-ab9f-b411892bb7c0","nextId":"RedditPost-6c01d8fd-4d07-55a3-bde6-b3740922a4e4","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://changemyview.buzzing.cc","author":"Buzzing.cc","locale":"zh","title":"你可以改变我的想法吗？","iconUrl":"https://i.imgur.com/jVsw5Oq.png","defaultSocialImageUrl":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1624129591276-5b11185e7b42?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2739&q=80","shortTitle":"改变我的想法","description":"用中文浏览Reddit-Change My View的热帖","keywords":["buzzing","改变我的想法","reddit"],"telegram":"@buzzingcc","telegram_chat_id":"-1001406368978","menuLinks":[{"name":"每周精选","url":"/issues"}],"subscriptions":[{"name":"Twitter @buzzingcc","url":"https://twitter.com/buzzingcc","external":true},{"name":"Telegram @buzzingcc","url":"https://t.me/buzzingcc","external":true},{"name":"RSS","url":"/rss.xml","prefetch":false}],"social":[{"name":"Change My View","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/","external":true}],"localize":[{"locale":"en","title":"Buzzing on Change My View","shortTitle":"BuzzCMV","description":"See what's buzzing on Reddit Change My View Subreddit in your native language","keywords":["buzzing","Change My View","Change My Mind"],"menuLinks":[{"name":"Weekly Selection","url":"/en/issues"}],"social":[{"name":"Change My View","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/en/","external":true}]},{"locale":"zh-Hant","title":"你可以改變我的想法嗎？","shortTitle":"改變我的想法","description":"用中文瀏覽Reddit-Change My View的熱帖","keywords":["buzzing","改變我的想法","reddit"],"menuLinks":[{"name":"每週精選","url":"/zh-Hant/issues"}],"social":[{"name":"Change My View","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/zh-Hant/","external":true}]},{"locale":"ja","title":"気が変わってもらえますか？","shortTitle":"気が変わってもらえますか","description":"人気のReddit気が変わってもらえますか記事を日本語で閲覧","keywords":["buzzing","気が変わってもらえますか？"],"menuLinks":[]}]},"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/books/comments/krhet2/found_my_love_for_reading_again_by_treating_books/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
