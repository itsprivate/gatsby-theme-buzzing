Pride and Prejudice, The Great Gatsby, A Tale of Two Cities, whenever I have tried reading these books I could hardly even understand them let alone enjoy it. However, I was recommended The Catcher in the Rye by a really good friend. It&#39;s her favorite and I trust her judgement so I gave it a try. It was amazing, I don&#39;t know if it was supposed to be funny but I found the way Holden narrated everything  annoying but hilarious at the same time. He  exaggerated everything  and made stuff seem so much more important than it may have actually been. I&#39;m glad I gave this book a try. I also loved how true everything Holden said was, sometimes he was over the top, but I could always see what he was getting at and thought that he had somewhat of a point. I believe everyone should read this book, there&#39;s so much you can pull from it, and many different ways to interpret what actually happens to Holden.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lmcnwc/catcher_in_the_rye_by_jd_salinger_really/","title":"Catcher in the Rye by J.D.
