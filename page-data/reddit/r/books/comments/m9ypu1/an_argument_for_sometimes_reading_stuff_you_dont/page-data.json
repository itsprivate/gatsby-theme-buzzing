Too many books, too little time to be wasted on something that doesn&#39;t grab you, etc. But, having just finished a book that I didn&#39;t like—I&#39;m not going to name names, but the author and the book are both well-loved by a lot of other folks—I&#39;ve been thinking about the arguments in favor of reading, at least some of the time, books that are not to your taste. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve come up with:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Reading outside your comfort zone (or even pleasure zone) allows you to participate in more conversations. The author I just now didn&#39;t enjoy is an author that people talk about a lot. I may not get pleasure in that author&#39;s work—I think I can say that, at least provisionally, after having read seven of their books—but I do get pleasure in being able to participate meaningfully in conversations where that author&#39;s work comes up.</li>\n<li>Staying with something forces you to deal with it. It forces you to see what little pleasures might be there be beyond what first strikes you; it forces you to become a more thoughtful and active reader. Which puts you in a position to get even more out of the books you do like.</li>\n<li>Confronting what you don&#39;t like also forces you to think about and maybe articulate <em>why</em> certain things please you and others don&#39;t; it refines your taste.</li>\n<li>It&#39;s also worth noting that tastes change. And maybe a book you don&#39;t like at first can be part of the force that changes those tastes. Maybe you do leave the book dissatisfied but also a little more ready to like another book that&#39;s a sort of compromise between what you just read and what you usually read. Maybe that book can begin to broaden you.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As I say, for the most part I believe in reading what you want to read, and I have tossed aside a good number of books partway through because they just didn&#39;t feel worth it. I&#39;m going to keep doing that. Life is short, etc. But sometimes—every once in a while—I&#39;m going to push myself to read all the way to the last page of something that just doesn&#39;t work for me. And I&#39;m going to be glad I did.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m9ypu1/an_argument_for_sometimes_reading_stuff_you_dont/","title":"An argument for (sometimes) reading stuff you don't like","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-22T03:55:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-22 03:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"9be6d5f5-3ad8-5973-875d-5ccec956b896","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m9ypu1/an_argument_for_sometimes_reading_stuff_you_dont/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m9ypu1/an_argument_for_sometimes_reading_stuff_you_dont/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"DavidEbenbach","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DavidEbenbach","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DavidEbenbach","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"关于（有时）阅读你不喜欢的东西的论据","the_new_excerpt":"总的来说，我是属于随遇而安派的读书人。太多\n书，时间太少，不能浪费在一些不抓紧你的东西上，等等。\n不过，刚看完一本不喜欢的书，我就不点名了。\n但作者和这本书都深受很多其他... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於（有時）閱讀你不喜歡的東西的論據","the_new_excerpt":"總的來說，我是屬於隨遇而安派的讀書人。太多\n書，時間太少，不能浪費在一些不抓緊你的東西上，等等。\n不過，剛看完一本不喜歡的書，我就不點名了。\n但作者和這本書都深受很多其他... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-456e12a7-518c-5d90-ad21-8ddd4b7f509a","excerpt":"One of my pet peeves with books is when the covers have single word review\nquotes from big names.
