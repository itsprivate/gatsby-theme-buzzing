He&#39;s really smart and has no qualms with reading other than not having enough down time in which to do so. Each time I finish a really good book, all I want to do is talk to him about it, but can never bring myself to do so as I feel like I&#39;m spoiling things for him, even though I know it&#39;s not likely that he&#39;ll ever read whatever book is in question. </p>\n\n<p>Last year I found an audiobook of The Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel on YouTube and decided to give it a go. Hubby listened to the whole thing with me and even seemed to enjoy it, even though he&#39;s more of a sci-fi/fantasy person. I&#39;m not much one for audiobooks and personally more of a fan of physical copies, so it was the first experience of it&#39;s kind that we&#39;d had together. </p>\n\n<p>Then one of my favorite books got adapted to a TV series. It&#39;s called A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness; my husband found a used copy at our local thrift shop and bought it for me as a Christmas present a few years ago. I fell in love and finished the trilogy as quickly as I could get my hands on each book. I bought the first season and binge watched every episode in a single sitting. Then hubby watched it with me. He enjoyed the story and commented on how he could see why I enjoyed the books so much. </p>\n\n<p>After watching the season twice in a week I was more than ready for a re-read, and then it hit me: if he enjoyed the Cave Bear audiobook, why don&#39;t I just read this one aloud to him? I&#39;m pretty good at it, even if I&#39;m not great with voices and stutter occasionally, but it&#39;s something I&#39;ve always enjoyed when I did it for school, reading to my siblings/our daughter, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Long story short, we are almost finished with the second book in the trilogy and he loves it as much as I do! All these years I&#39;ve wanted to share this passion with him and we have finally found a way to enjoy books together. I couldn&#39;t be happier. </p>\n\n<p>(Posting this on mobile so apologies in advance for any formatting issues. Also, I&#39;m no author so go easy on my grammar lol.)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/majgty/my_husband_is_finally_reading_and_i_am_over_the/","title":"My husband is finally reading and I am over the moon.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-22T11:20:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-22 11:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"566def49-c127-5aa8-bf42-eb6075b4e894","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/majgty/my_husband_is_finally_reading_and_i_am_over_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/majgty/my_husband_is_finally_reading_and_i_am_over_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"MollyWhingo","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MollyWhingo","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"MollyWhingo","score":64,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"老公终于读懂了，我也是喜出望外。","the_new_excerpt":"我们在一起快十年了 我从来没有见过他。\n完成一本书。他真的很聪明，对读书没有任何顾虑，除了不\n有足够的时间去做。每次我完成一个非常好的\n书，所有我想做的就是和他谈谈， 但永远不能把... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"老公終於讀懂了，我也是喜出望外。","the_new_excerpt":"我們在一起快十年了 我從來沒有見過他。\n完成一本書。他真的很聰明，對讀書沒有任何顧慮，除了不\n有足夠的時間去做。每次我完成一個非常好的\n書，所有我想做的就是和他談談， 但永遠不能把... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e60c5597-b505-5f67-9f1a-3c697c7d7603","excerpt":"Everyone had always been talking about these series and it was on my tbr but I\nnever got to it until this week and it was worth it.
