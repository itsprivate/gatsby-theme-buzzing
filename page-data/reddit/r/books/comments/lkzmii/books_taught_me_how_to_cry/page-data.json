Someone told me that it is normal for teenage boys to stop crying due to some hormone thing. I recently found out that that was a myth, and wanted to learn how to do it again, to recover from the trauma that stopped my tears. It was hard. I told myself it was a manly, brave, and a strong thing to do. I&#39;ve cried occasionally over the last two years.\nLately I&#39;ve been crying more. I&#39;ve been reading emotional books: young adult literature 📚</p>\n\n<p>Crying with the characters from Perks of Being a Wallflower, How I Live Now, Anne Frank&#39;s Diary, and Solitaire is therapeutical and safe, and crying somehow makes coping with the you-know-what global situation easier. I appreciate my friends more and the world is overwhelmingly beautiful at times. It&#39;s largely due to this community that I&#39;ve been reading much more. Thank you all. Peace and love.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lkzmii/books_taught_me_how_to_cry/","title":"Books taught me how to cry","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-16T20:01:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-16 20:01","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"3abd5de7-42c7-58b1-8230-f1489fa80e4e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lkzmii/books_taught_me_how_to_cry/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lkzmii/books_taught_me_how_to_cry/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"morag_macdougal","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/morag_macdougal","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"morag_macdougal","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"书本教会了我如何哭泣","the_new_excerpt":"大概有10年的时间，我就是哭不出来。有人告诉我，这很正常\n十几岁的男孩因为一些激素的事情而停止哭泣。我最近发现\n那是个神话，想再学学怎么做，恢复一下。\n创伤，让我的眼泪止不住地流。这很难。我告诉自己那是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"書本教會了我如何哭泣","the_new_excerpt":"大概有10年的時間，我就是哭不出來。有人告訴我，這很正常\n十幾歲的男孩因爲一些激素的事情而停止哭泣。我最近發現\n那是個神話，想再學學怎麼做，恢復一下。\n創傷，讓我的眼淚止不住地流。這很難。我告訴自己那是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6d435a79-bbec-57c5-91db-b6456aa45b85","excerpt":"I am in this process myself and I am somewhat confused about what it means to be\na man right now.
