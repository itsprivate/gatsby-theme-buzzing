Honestly, every year older my daughter has gotten has just been more and more enjoyable, especially now that she&#39;s excited about reading for herself. </p>\n\n<p>She&#39;s seven now, and she reads on her own pretty constantly, but we still have the ritual of reading books before bed. I loved this ritual when it was board books with words she didn&#39;t understand, I loved it when they were rhyming books that she would memorize and recite with me, and I loved it when they were longer picture books, especially books I remembered from my own childhood. But in the last couple of years we&#39;ve started reading chapter books, and I&#39;m getting to share with her some of my FAVORITE stories, and it&#39;s the most incredible experience.</p>\n\n<p>We read the first few Harry Potter books 3 times, because she always wanted to start again when we were finished. Each time she convinced me to read a couple books farther, until this year when we finally finished the series. I know there&#39;s a lot of content that she can&#39;t fully comprehend, but just sharing the story with her and seeing her get so into it (she was Hermione for Halloween 2 years in a row) is amazing. We&#39;ve also read Ella Enchanted twice, one of my all-time favorite books from when I was a kid, and when we finished it the last time she said &quot;That is my FAVORITE book!&quot; </p>\n\n<p>The books I&#39;m reading with her were such a big part of my life, for years and years before she was even born. When we read them together it feels like we&#39;re creating a special bond that is separate from other parts of our mother-daughter relationship. It feels like she&#39;s getting to meet the 11 year-old-me who originally read and fell in love with that story, and it&#39;s indescribably cool.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/n4zbr7/reading_with_my_daughter_has_been_one_of_the_most/","title":"Reading with my daughter has been one of the most rewarding parenting experiences I've had","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"May 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-04T22:53:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-04 22:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"d1e9c175-5ede-59d1-9e87-596df402b5e3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/n4zbr7/reading_with_my_daughter_has_been_one_of_the_most/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/n4zbr7/reading_with_my_daughter_has_been_one_of_the_most/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"-BigGirlPants-","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/-BigGirlPants-","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"-BigGirlPants-","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"娘と一緒に読書をすることは、これまでの子育ての中で最もやりがいのある経験のひとつです","the_new_excerpt":"私は母親であることが大好きですが、「もう一人赤ちゃんが欲しい、赤ちゃんがいないと寂しい！」と思った瞬間は一度もありませんでした。\nと思ったことは一度もありません。正直なところ、娘が年をとるごとに\n正直なところ、娘が年を重ねるごとに、ますます楽しくなってきましたし、特に今は、自分で本を読むことに興奮しています。\n特に今は、自分で本を読むことに興奮しています。 \n\n今、娘は7歳ですが、本を読むのは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"与女儿一起阅读是我最有意义的育儿经验之一","the_new_excerpt":"我喜欢当妈妈，但我从来没有想过 \"我想再要一个孩子，我想念有孩子的日子！\"的时刻。\n另一个孩子，我想念有一个孩子！\"。说实话，我女儿每长大一岁\n越来越令人愉快，尤其是现在她对自己阅读感到兴奋。\n兴奋，尤其是现在她对自己的阅读感兴趣。 \n\n她现在七岁了，她读...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"與女兒一起閱讀是我最有意義的育兒經驗之一","the_new_excerpt":"我喜歡當媽媽，但我從來沒有想過 \"我想再要一個孩子，我想念有孩子的日子！\"的時刻。\n另一個孩子，我想念有一個孩子！\"。說實話，我女兒每長大一歲\n越來越令人愉快，尤其是現在她對自己閱讀感到興奮。\n興奮，尤其是現在她對自己的閱讀感興趣。 \n\n她現在七歲了，她讀...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-0404c491-b84a-5c14-9eea-35693e482f5e","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/n4r1pz/andy_weirs_new_space_odyssey_a_new_novel_from_the/","title":"Andy Weir’s New Space Odyssey: A new novel from “The Martian” author is slightly more out there, but it still has plenty of particle physics.","date":"May 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アンディ・ウィアーの「新・宇宙の旅」。The Martian」の作者による新しい小説は、やや外向的だが、素粒子物理学がふんだんに盛り込まれている。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"安迪-韦尔的《新太空漫游》。火星人》作者的新小说稍显出位，但仍有大量的粒子物理学内容。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"安迪-韋爾的《新太空漫遊》。火星人》作者的新小說稍顯出位，但仍有大量的粒子物理學內容。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-2bc6e826-2855-5523-9de4-4f1011c65e05","excerpt":"Seriously.
