I’ve never been a fan, although I’ve liked movies that I didn’t know were based on King novels at the time (Shawshank, Green Mile). I’ve never really liked his writing. I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with it but I’m not a fan of his style of writing. My wife thinks I’m crazy to not like him and to placate her in “giving him a chance” I’ve read several of his books. </p>\n\n<p>Currently I’ve read:\n-all seven books of the Dark Tower series\n-The Stand\n-It\n-The Long Walk\n-Eyes of the Dragon\n-Pet Sematary\n-The Shining\n-The Outsiders\n-Doctor Sleep (currently reading)</p>\n\n<p>I know this is basically just scratching the surface of King’s work, but other than Tolkien and maybe Kate Elliot, I don’t think I’ve read so much of a single authors work. I’ll normally just read one book or series from one author and move on</p>\n\n<p>Edit: To clarify, I do like some of the stories. It’s mostly his style that I don’t like.
