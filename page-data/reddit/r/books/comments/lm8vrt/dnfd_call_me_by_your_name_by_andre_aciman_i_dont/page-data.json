Honestly I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m missing.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a setting reader. I love immersive and beautiful settings, so I was looking forward to reading this one, especially after seeing it everywhere in recommendation posts like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BooksThatFeelLikeThis/comments/g3jxsl/books_that_feel_like_this/\">this.</a> The setting wasn&#39;t as vibrant as I wanted it to be, but that&#39;s not why I DNF&#39;d it.</p>\n\n<p>Nor was it because of how bland the characters were. Elio&#39;s main personality trait was <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">sneaking into someone&#39;s room and smelling their dirty underwear.</span> Weird, but ok.</p>\n\n<p>What really stopped me was <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">masturbating into a peach </span>and then <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">comparing said peach to a rape victim.</span>Followed by <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Oliver eating the peach...?</span></p>\n\n<p>After reading the reviews, I found out that <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Elio later wishes he could put Oliver in a wheelchair so that he can never leave him.</span>What the heck kind of toxic crap is that?</p>\n\n<p>Bland setting. Bland characters. Toxic romance. Average plot.</p>\n\n<p>What am I missing and why are so many people in love with this book?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lm8vrt/dnfd_call_me_by_your_name_by_andre_aciman_i_dont/","title":"DNF'd Call Me By Your Name by Andre Aciman.
