I literally had nightmares about this book. The fact that everything that went down in the book started with congress being assassinated and then reading this after the riot at the Capitol on January 6th made me very uncomfortable. This feels like something that could so easily happen if the wrong people came into power. The thought of having my freedoms and independence stripped from me law by law and leaving me just as an empty vessel forced to conceive or die is too much to bear. What are your thoughts and how did you feel after reading this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mcn48h/the_handmaids_tale_is_actually_horror/","title":"The Handmaid's Tale is actually horror","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-25T07:00:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-25 07:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"67f11210-2ea9-5df5-862d-f7790eebd05f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mcn48h/the_handmaids_tale_is_actually_horror/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mcn48h/the_handmaids_tale_is_actually_horror/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"kittymeowkittyqueen","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/kittymeowkittyqueen","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"kittymeowkittyqueen","score":58,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"婢女的故事》其实是恐怖片。","the_new_excerpt":"我刚读完《女仆的故事》的第一遍，从\n从头到尾我都被深深地困扰着。我真的做了很多噩梦\n的书。事实上，书中的所有事情都是从国会开始的。\n被暗杀，然后读到这个后 骚乱在... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"婢女的故事》其實是恐怖片。","the_new_excerpt":"我剛讀完《女僕的故事》的第一遍，從\n從頭到尾我都被深深地困擾着。我真的做了很多噩夢\n的書。事實上，書中的所有事情都是從國會開始的。\n被暗殺，然後讀到這個後 騷亂在... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-b5f1c8a5-b32d-5f5f-895a-f4aef59a48c6","excerpt":"I think we all resonate with most books to a certain extent and compare them to\nour lives but which book felt undoubtedly meant to be in your life and perhaps\nchanged the course of your life?\n\nMine was Forty Rules of Love by Elif Shafak.
