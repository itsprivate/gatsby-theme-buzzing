I decided to start going back through some of the classics that I was able to find on Project Gutenberg and other places. In the past year I&#39;ve read: To Kill a Mockingbird, The Picture of Dorian Gray, 1984, Animal Farm, Heart of Darkness, The Count of Monte Cristo, Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog), Moby Dick, and a few others I&#39;m probably forgetting right now. It&#39;s been a wonderful journey and I&#39;m learning why these are considered classics. It&#39;s an amazing feeling to have these authors transport me into their worlds.</p>\n\n<p>I just finished The Three Musketeers. What an amazing book! Next, I think I&#39;m going to read The Jungle Book.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m thoroughly enjoying my sojourn through these classic tales. I&#39;m so excited to start another as soon as I finish one.</p>\n\n<p>I just wanted to share my fun. Happy reading, all!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m7cic4/reading_classics_during_lunch/","title":"Reading classics during lunch","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-18T03:26:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-18 03:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"c248609c-e03b-50a1-b2d2-331d786df303","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m7cic4/reading_classics_during_lunch/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m7cic4/reading_classics_during_lunch/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"timbillyosu","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/timbillyosu","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"timbillyosu","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"午间阅读经典","the_new_excerpt":"通过Covid，我一直在工作外的长椅上或车里吃午餐。\n天气不好的时候。我决定开始回溯一些过去。\n经典，我能够在古腾堡计划和其他地方找到。在\n在过去的一年里，我读了 《杀死一只知更鸟》、《多里安的画像》... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"午間閱讀經典","the_new_excerpt":"通過Covid，我一直在工作外的長椅上或車裏喫午餐。\n天氣不好的時候。我決定開始回溯一些過去。\n經典，我能夠在古騰堡計劃和其他地方找到。在\n在過去的一年裏，我讀了 《殺死一隻知更鳥》、《多裏安的畫像》... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-91ef5ff1-a558-574f-85a2-95b75ba8f388","excerpt":"I recently, unexpectedly, lost my eyesight.
