The whole thing was interesting, but the list that I found most intriguing was Marilyn Monroe&#39;s. Some of the stuff listed included:</p>\n\n<p><em>The Sun Also Rises</em> by Ernest Hemingway</p>\n\n<p><em>Ulysses</em> by James Joyce</p>\n\n<p><em>On the Road</em> by Jack Kerouac</p>\n\n<p><em>Crime and Punishment</em> by Dostoyevsky</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve always found Ms. Monroe to be a fascinating person. I tend to be drawn to tragic figures, so I always knew she was more than the &quot;dumb blonde&quot; image that was thrown at her. Still, there&#39;s a lot that I don&#39;t know about her, like her passion for literature. She apparently even wrote her own poetry!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“On the screen of pitch blackness<br/>\ncomes the shapes of monsters<br/>\nmy most steadfast companions …<br/>\nand the world is sleeping<br/>\nah peace I need you – even a peaceful monster.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I did a bit more digging and became more and more fascinated. She shared her mantra for exploring various titles when a director caught her reading a copy of Rilke&#39;s <em>Letters to a Young Poet:</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“On nights when I’ve got nothing else to do, I go to the Pickwick bookstore on Hollywood Boulevard and just open books at random—when I come to a page or a paragraph I like, I buy that book. So last night I bought this one. Is that wrong?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She also dug Camus, Beckett, Tolstoy, and even had a first edition copy of Ralph Ellison&#39;s <em>Invisible Man</em> which, as an African American, I find very endearing, although she already had shown her support for civil rights so I shouldn&#39;t have been surprised!</p>\n\n<p>She also had a heavily marked copy of <em>The Little Engine That Could.</em> That book always struck a chord with me as a kid and I&#39;d be lying if I didn&#39;t admit to thinking about it during some darker periods of my own adult life. I know Ms. Monroe struggled with her own sense of insecurity, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that book was on her mind as well (although that&#39;s obviously speculation on my part).</p>\n\n<p>Anyhow, I just thought I&#39;d shed some light on another side of her that most people might not have been aware of.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lvdsy6/til_that_marilyn_monroe_was_quite_the_bookworm/","title":"TiL that Marilyn Monroe was quite the bookworm!","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-01T22:57:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-01 22:57","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"50a8895c-7011-5f99-9263-abf97282a733","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lvdsy6/til_that_marilyn_monroe_was_quite_the_bookworm/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lvdsy6/til_that_marilyn_monroe_was_quite_the_bookworm/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/FV4ppNa34LR818mOaa4KjfaDjDtMKCEqZauBCgnQmsQ.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=06bd43aed0103588029b45467efeedbba04482c7","video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"thewickerstan","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/thewickerstan","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"thewickerstan","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"TiL，玛丽莲-梦露是相当书虫！","the_new_excerpt":"我试着在r/todayilearned[/r/todayilearned]上分享这个，但他们不愿意。\nr/books [/r/books]似乎是一个。\n可能更感兴趣的人群反正...\n\n作为一个书虫，我喜欢看一些我喜欢的公众人物喜欢的东西\n朗诵","locale":"zh"},{"title":"TiL，瑪麗蓮-夢露是相當書蟲！","the_new_excerpt":"我試着在r/todayilearned[/r/todayilearned]上分享這個，但他們不願意。\nr/books [/r/books]似乎是一個。\n可能更感興趣的人羣反正...\n\n作爲一個書蟲，我喜歡看一些我喜歡的公衆人物喜歡的東西\n朗誦","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-52cce95d-61c3-580e-9eb8-3912232bf2b5","excerpt":"Hello I just recently decided to get into philosophy ,Any tips on where to start","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/lva822/i_want_to_start_reading_philosophy/","title":"I want to start reading philosophy","date":"March 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我想开始读哲学","the_new_excerpt":"你好，我最近决定进入哲学，任何提示在哪里开始。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我想開始讀哲學","the_new_excerpt":"你好，我最近決定進入哲學，任何提示在哪裏開始。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-8be64597-349f-566c-ae0a-1654693074df","excerpt":"I finished The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas a few weeks ago and HIGHLY recommend\nit.
