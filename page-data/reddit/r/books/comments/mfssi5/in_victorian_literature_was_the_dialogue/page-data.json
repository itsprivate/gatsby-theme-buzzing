Take this quote from Helen Burns in Jane Eyre:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. We are, and must be, one and all, burdened by faults in this world; but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies...I hold another creed, which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention, but in which I delight, and to which I cling; for it extends hope to all; it makes Eternity a rest—a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Helen Burns is fourteen. FOURTEEN. Try to picture a 14 year old saying that. It just doesn&#39;t work. But take Tom Sawyer. It was published just about 29 years later, but with the exception of a bit of outdated slang, the characters could easily be from the present. And I read somewhere that Tom Sayer was one of the first popular books to use &quot;vernacular speech&quot;. Does that mean that Jane Eyre used speech that was formalized in writing? Or did everyone speak formally? Help me out.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mfssi5/in_victorian_literature_was_the_dialogue/","title":"In Victorian literature, was the dialogue embellished, or is that how they actually spoke?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-29T17:35:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-29 17:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"467b4995-3aa5-5223-bd45-42a041503258","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mfssi5/in_victorian_literature_was_the_dialogue/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mfssi5/in_victorian_literature_was_the_dialogue/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"visk1","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/visk1","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"visk1","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"在维多利亚时代的文学作品中，对话是经过润色的，还是他们实际的说话方式？","the_new_excerpt":"我一直有很多的麻烦，因为无论我怎么努力，我\n无法想象人物说话的样子......那样。拿海伦的这句话来说\n简爱》中的伯恩斯\n\n> 生命对我来说太短暂了，不能把时间花在培养敌意或登记上。\n> 错误。我们是，也必须是，一体的，... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在維多利亞時代的文學作品中，對話是經過潤色的，還是他們實際的說話方式？","the_new_excerpt":"我一直有很多的麻煩，因爲無論我怎麼努力，我\n無法想象人物說話的樣子......那樣。拿海倫的這句話來說\n簡愛》中的伯恩斯\n\n> 生命對我來說太短暫了，不能把時間花在培養敵意或登記上。\n> 錯誤。我們是，也必須是，一體的，... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-173cec78-4546-5be2-a974-2105047ab4b9","excerpt":"I have a dear friend in her 70s who is pretty holed up in her apartment due to\ncovid related concerns.
