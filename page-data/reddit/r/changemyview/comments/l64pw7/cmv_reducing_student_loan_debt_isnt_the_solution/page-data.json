Why? Because the higher the costs of attending, the more students will have to borrow. In the coming years, college costs are expected to continue to rise to a point where the average amount borrowed will exceed the mortgage of a half a million dollar house. The higher the costs of attending college, the more students and families will have to borrow. And vice versus. That’s what people are not understanding. But since, colleges probably will not do that, we have to find ways to reduce student loan debt. </p>\n\n<p>It’s so ridiculous that in a country like America, how expensive college is. Especially compared to other countries. It’s even more ridiculous that a student has to go into such debt to get an education. I just don’t understand how college has gotten so expensive. I mean, if more people are attending college, shouldn’t it be cheaper?
