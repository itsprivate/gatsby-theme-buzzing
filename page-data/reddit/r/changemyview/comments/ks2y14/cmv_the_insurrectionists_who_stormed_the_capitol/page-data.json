A woman was shot and died when the insurrectionists stormed the Capitol today.  Many jurisdictions apply the proximate cause theory to felony murder, which says that all persons involved in committing a felony can be charged with felony murder if someone is killed during the commission of the felony, even if the death was caused by a bystander or the police.  Any reasonable person could foresee that attempting to force their way past police into the Capitol building would result in violence and possible loss of life.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thank you to the people who have actually provided reasoned arguments.<br/>\nFuck you to the people who are just engaging in whataboutism. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ks2y14/cmv_the_insurrectionists_who_stormed_the_capitol/","title":"CMV: The insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol today should be charged under the felony murder rule.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-07T04:02:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-07 04:02","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3e80ca92-df02-59ce-898b-97c11773f7ab","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ks2y14/cmv_the_insurrectionists_who_stormed_the_capitol/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ks2y14/cmv_the_insurrectionists_who_stormed_the_capitol/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"covers33","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/covers33","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"covers33","score":120,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：今天袭击国会大厦的叛乱分子应该根据重罪谋杀规则被起诉。","the_new_excerpt":"袭击国会大厦和袭警是重罪。一名女子被\n今天起义者袭击国会大厦时被击毙。许多\n司法管辖区将近因理论应用于重罪谋杀，即\n所有涉及重罪的人都可能被指控犯有…罪。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：今天襲擊國會大廈的叛亂分子應該根據重罪謀殺規則被起訴。","the_new_excerpt":"襲擊國會大廈和襲警是重罪。一名女子被\n今天起義者襲擊國會大廈時被擊斃。許多\n司法管轄區將近因理論應用於重罪謀殺，即\n所有涉及重罪的人都可能被指控犯有…罪。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6c826472-1c36-5ddc-a91a-36f7292621fc","excerpt":"I want you to poke holes in this simple if A and B then C must be true argument.\n\nCMV: If you believe life begins at conception AND in birthright citizenship,\nthen you must also believe that a person who was conceived in a country must be\ngiven citizenship to that country solely on that basis,…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kryegf/cmv_if_you_believe_life_begins_at_conception_and/","title":"CMV: If you believe life begins at conception AND in birthright citizenship, then you must also believe that a person who was conceived in a country must be given citizenship to that country solely on that basis, regardless of where they were born.","date":"January 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：如果你相信生命始于受孕和出生公民权，那么你也必须相信，在一个国家怀孕的人必须完全在这个基础上获得该国公民身份，无论他们出生在哪里。","the_new_excerpt":"我希望你们在这个简单的，如果A和B，那么C必须是真参数。\n\n[改变我的想法]：如果你相信生命始于受孕和与生俱来的公民身份，\n那么你也必须相信一个在一个国家受孕的人一定是\n仅仅在这个基础上，…就被赋予了那个国家的公民身份","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：如果你相信生命始於受孕和出生公民權，那麼你也必須相信，在一個國家懷孕的人必須完全在這個基礎上獲得該國公民身份，無論他們出生在哪裏。","the_new_excerpt":"我希望你們在這個簡單的，如果A和B，那麼C必須是真參數。\n\n[改變我的想法]：如果你相信生命始於受孕和與生俱來的公民身份，\n那麼你也必須相信一個在一個國家受孕的人一定是\n僅僅在這個基礎上，…就被賦予了那個國家的公民身份","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-020b72ce-1ce0-593e-884d-92cff6453bd7","excerpt":"what is \"A Racist\"? when people say \"Tom is a racist don't hire him\" what do\nthey mean? i use to assume they mean that Tom dismisses and judged people based\non the color of their skin, or that he looked down at a specific race, because\nof their race. in which case i would not even interview Tom.
