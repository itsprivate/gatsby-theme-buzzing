Not to mention this movie completely ruins continuity in the already established universe, (Oh, she can fly 30 years before Batman Vs. Superman/Justice League where she can&#39;t?) Awesome, phenomenal work, Patty Jenkins.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/la54gt/cmv_wonder_woman_1984_is_one_of_the_worst/","title":"CMV: Wonder Woman 1984 is one of the worst superhero genre movies filmed.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-01T16:57:04.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-01 16:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"6e9dc7d8-d008-5119-88ac-1b69b00b4a97","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/la54gt/cmv_wonder_woman_1984_is_one_of_the_worst/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/la54gt/cmv_wonder_woman_1984_is_one_of_the_worst/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"lifeleecher","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lifeleecher","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"lifeleecher","score":71,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：《神奇女侠1984》是拍摄的最差的超级英雄类型电影之一。","the_new_excerpt":"绝对是一部垃圾的电影。佩德罗-帕斯卡和加尔-加朵的演技是唯一的亮点。\n两个愉快的事情，这块垃圾有提供。作为一个巨大的DC和Marvel\n粉丝，这和《惊弓之鸟》、《正义联盟》是一个级别的......只是。\n可怕的。失败的风格，没有内涵。\n\n\n\n俗气的效果没有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：《神奇女俠1984》是拍攝的最差的超級英雄類型電影之一。","the_new_excerpt":"絕對是一部垃圾的電影。佩德羅-帕斯卡和加爾-加朵的演技是唯一的亮點。\n兩個愉快的事情，這塊垃圾有提供。作爲一個巨大的DC和Marvel\n粉絲，這和《驚弓之鳥》、《正義聯盟》是一個級別的......只是。\n可怕的。失敗的風格，沒有內涵。\n\n\n\n俗氣的效果沒有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-123e50b4-cc88-564b-ac61-51a43821b3be","excerpt":"When my bank, or my university, or my email forces me to have a password that's\nat least 10 symbols, letters and numbers and uppercase and lowercase, I respect\nthat.
