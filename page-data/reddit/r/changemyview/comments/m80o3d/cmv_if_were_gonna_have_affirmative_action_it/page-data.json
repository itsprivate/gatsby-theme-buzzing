Minorities in the US face greater obstacles and should not be expected to be as achieving as their white and asian counterparts. Fine, that&#39;s true. But it&#39;s a wide view. <a href=\"https://blog.collegevine.com/what-is-affirmative-action/\">71% of Harvard&#39;s brown student population came from rich families</a>. So, it looks like it&#39;s often not  economically challenged minorities who are getting the final push into an elite school from Affirmative Action. So while a privileged black or hispanic kid gets a seat, a really challenged eastern European first-generation kid with working class parents who&#39;s almost at the finish line (if you will) gets rejected.</p>\n\n<p>(PS, yes I know college admission are &quot;holistic, and more complicated than checking off boxes and two students are never compared side-by-side in an admissions room; this is a simplification).</p>\n\n<p>And even if the private school-educated, rich family minority student also experiences true, real discrimination that hinders their academic or extracurricular performance, racially-based AA has a way-too-exploitable loophole.</p>\n\n<p>That eastern European, first generation kid, let&#39;s pit him against a different student this time: an English-speaking white kid with wealthy Brazilian parents. This guy can identify as &quot;hispanic&quot; on his college application and get an edge. Which is ridiculous. No one wants that, except the colleges who can show off a &quot;diverse&quot; student body while getting lots of full-tuition paying students.</p>\n\n<p>So now, let&#39;s get back to why Affirmative Action exists. For the most part, it does not compensate for the greater obstacles minorities face. Financially speaking, elite colleges are very undiverse, so a lot of struggles go unrepresented.</p>\n\n<p>Ok thats all folks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m80o3d/cmv_if_were_gonna_have_affirmative_action_it/","title":"CMV: If we're gonna have Affirmative Action, it Should be Financially Based, Not Racially Based","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-19T15:37:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-19 15:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b02a34ff-26aa-53f3-b6c3-f459d0387210","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m80o3d/cmv_if_were_gonna_have_affirmative_action_it/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m80o3d/cmv_if_were_gonna_have_affirmative_action_it/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"GoGraystripe","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GoGraystripe","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"GoGraystripe","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"如果我们要采取平权行动，就应该以经济为基础，而不是以种族为基础。","the_new_excerpt":"呜呜，又是一个AA制的帖子，hoooooow originaaaal\n\n(前言：我认为 \"少数族裔 \"包括亚洲人。我认为 \"少数族裔 \"包括亚洲人，但让我们假装不包括他们\n(为该员额的目的)\n\n为什么会有AA制存在？在美国，少数族裔面临更大的障碍，不应\n....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果我們要採取平權行動，就應該以經濟爲基礎，而不是以種族爲基礎。","the_new_excerpt":"嗚嗚，又是一個AA制的帖子，hoooooow originaaaal\n\n(前言：我認爲 \"少數族裔 \"包括亞洲人。我認爲 \"少數族裔 \"包括亞洲人，但讓我們假裝不包括他們\n(爲該員額的目的)\n\n爲什麼會有AA制存在？在美國，少數族裔面臨更大的障礙，不應\n....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-cc4e29d1-e4ec-549e-85ac-823be9edb64e","excerpt":"Autistic person here, before anyone comes at me.\n\n(20F for context) I was diagnosed on the mid-high end of the spectrum when i was\n8 years old.
