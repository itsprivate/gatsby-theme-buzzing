People&#39;s costs of living are not only regionally different and more importantly situationally different. There is a great broad-strokes tool from MIT which has a &quot;living wage&quot; calculator, which calculates it based on regional cost AND household size/working adults.  </p>\n\n<p>For an example: a living wage for two working adults in Chicago is $12.83 if they both work and have no kids.  If instead it is one parent with one child, that number becomes $32.32.  VASTLY different, and no working person&#39;s wage changes with this standard.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the point, it is at least intellectually and morally  for those who support the minimum wage to support raising it so that is a <em>close guess</em> to what it takes to live in most places on your own.  Too low in some, but too high in others, but close enough. <strong>They&#39;re at least trying to say &quot;if we&#39;re going to have a minimum wage, it should be the minimum amount you can get paid for a reason.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why, and this is my view, you can&#39;t NOT support raising the minimum wage and support having one at tall.  <strong>What DOES the $7.25 represent other than an arbitrary minimum that has no basis in any level of expenses a typical American has?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you can somehow string together a case for someone who&#39;s real cost of living can be tied to $7.25 an hour, can you not find someone lower?  Take the spouse of a high income earner, what is their &quot;minimum wage&quot; for their cost of living needs?  What of a child, or a retiree?  There ARE people for whom ANY money is just for spending on luxuries or extras.  To that end, they really want the minimum wage is $0.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a practical standard for now, but I can&#39;t argue that it doesn&#39;t make a level of sense.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The ONLY reason that people arguing against the current talks about raising the minimum wage don&#39;t argue for it being $0.00 is because they know it&#39;s too unpopular, and thus they try to convince people that changing is</strong> <strong><em>too disruptive</em></strong> <strong>even though $7.25 has no basis in anything other than past assumptions of REAL cost of living that are outdated.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nobody actually wants the minimum wage to be $7.25.</p>\n\n<p>So, CMV.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lvfe12/cmv_you_are_either_for_raising_the_minimum_wage/","title":"CMV: You are either for raising the Minimum Wage or Abolishing it.
