The true &quot;silent majority/silent group&quot; is people who are more &quot;in the middle&quot; than those that lean to the left or the right.</p>\n\n<p>In social media, we tend to hear more from people on the left and people on the right. Yes, there are subreddits devoted to libertarians, centrists, etc, but how loud, are those subreddits? Not very. You are more likely to hear a right or left-leaning opinion in the media, or on social media. The loudest opinions are either on the left or on the right</p>\n\n<p>Think about it: how much of a difference does it make to vote for an independent or libertarian candidate in a major election? Not much. So, in voting, people in the middle have to choose between either the REALLY loud left, and the REALLY loud right. </p>\n\n<p>So, because left and right-leaning opinions are heard more often on social media and in elections, the real silent group is those that are in the middle. Now, I can&#39;t say whether or not people who are in the middle are the silent majority or silent minority, but they are the more silent group in general.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/l0873h/cmv_people_who_are_in_the_middle_of_the_political/","title":"CMV: People Who Are In The Middle of the Political Spectrum Are The REAL Silent Group (In the U.S., at least)","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-19T18:27:04.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-19 18:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"1bcd205b-ad84-59a6-a45e-d3160a9695d6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l0873h/cmv_people_who_are_in_the_middle_of_the_political/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l0873h/cmv_people_who_are_in_the_middle_of_the_political/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"UnknownFor3818","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/UnknownFor3818","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"UnknownFor3818","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：处于政治光谱中间的人是真正的沉默群体（至少在美国）。","the_new_excerpt":"无论是民主党人还是共和党人（我将以 \"左 \"和 \"右 \"来称呼他们。\n\"右派\"，因为这样打字更容易）都声称自己是 \"沉默的大多数\"。\n双方都不是真正的沉默的大多数，也根本不是一个沉默的群体。\n真正的 \"沉默的大多数/沉默的群体 \"是那些更...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：處於政治光譜中間的人是真正的沉默羣體（至少在美國）。","the_new_excerpt":"無論是民主黨人還是共和黨人（我將以 \"左 \"和 \"右 \"來稱呼他們。\n\"右派\"，因爲這樣打字更容易）都聲稱自己是 \"沉默的大多數\"。\n雙方都不是真正的沉默的大多數，也根本不是一個沉默的羣體。\n真正的 \"沉默的大多數/沉默的羣體 \"是那些更...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-d5272c69-8222-5bb0-bb17-874cb2b5af74","excerpt":"Here's the case study: I noticed that After George Floyd was killed last year, a\nlot of white and otherwise very privileged people started using the\nBlackouttuesday tag to post black squares, putting BLM slogans in social media\nbios and using Breonna Taylor's murder as a buzzword, calling…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/l0ibdw/cmv_too_many_privileged_people_call_themselves_an/","title":"CMV: Too many privileged people call themselves an \"activist\" because they want to be applauded for doing the bare minimum","date":"January 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：太多的特权人士称自己为 \"活动家\"，因为他们希望因为做了最起码的事情而得到掌声。","the_new_excerpt":"这是案例分析。我注意到去年乔治-弗洛伊德被杀后，有一个...\n很多白人和其他非常特权的人开始使用的。\nBlackouttuesday标签发布黑色方块，在社交媒体上放BLM口号。\n用布伦娜-泰勒的谋杀案作为流行语，称... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：太多的特權人士稱自己爲 \"活動家\"，因爲他們希望因爲做了最起碼的事情而得到掌聲。","the_new_excerpt":"這是案例分析。我注意到去年喬治-弗洛伊德被殺後，有一個...\n很多白人和其他非常特權的人開始使用的。\nBlackouttuesday標籤發佈黑色方塊，在社交媒體上放BLM口號。\n用布倫娜-泰勒的謀殺案作爲流行語，稱... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-5e66534b-ee04-5326-b985-d390a6334a63","excerpt":"This was a failure of leadership and personnel, not the result of systemic\nlimitations that prevented those agencies from guarding the Capitol.
