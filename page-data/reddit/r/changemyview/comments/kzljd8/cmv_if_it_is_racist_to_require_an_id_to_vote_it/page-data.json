How can it be racist to require an ID to vote (18 yrs old citizen, not a felon), but it isn’t racist to require an ID to buy a gun? It’s almost the same requirements (18, not a felon), so I don’t see how you can call one racist and the other not. </p>\n\n<p>I use those two as examples because they are both enumerated rights within the constitution. </p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I don’t think it is racist to require Identification in order to do either, I think that both are important and serious enough to justify identification. I do believe that if one is racist then the other must also be racist, which is the most important part of my cmv.</p>\n\n<p>In order to change my view, you must be able to demonstrate to me that the two should be decoupled.</p>\n\n<p>I am not going to be persuaded by the argument that a gun can kill someone but a vote is not deadly.
