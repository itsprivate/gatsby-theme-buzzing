Reading the reddit comments made me realize that no one in positions of power really care about the people at the bottom of the pit. The honest truth is greed will come before anything else and at any cost even to the bottom line. You can throw all the numbers and economics you want, but everything will remain status quo. The only way I see any sort of drastic change to help the people who are most in need is if a civil war happened. Sounds stupid and naive and edgy, but I honestly don&#39;t see any other way to get the people at the top to change their minds. You can&#39;t pull money out of politics because corporations and billionaires have the money and power to overthrow the government and hold them like puppets. So the only way to fix this is to dismantle and rebuild the structure of governance from the ground up to earn back the trust of the people and hold the corporations and the rich accountable for their actions. If they don&#39;t make radical changes to fix the systemic issues of the government helping the poor get out of poverty to match modern times, nothing will get done and poor people will remain poor and the rich will continue to become richer.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/md6bmn/cmv_the_us_doesnt_care_about_the_impoverished_and/","title":"CMV: The US doesn't care about the impoverished and nothing will ever change for them.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-26T04:52:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-26 04:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a64bac9e-266b-53bb-ad03-c6d93e955afb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/md6bmn/cmv_the_us_doesnt_care_about_the_impoverished_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/md6bmn/cmv_the_us_doesnt_care_about_the_impoverished_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Inaerius","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Inaerius","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Inaerius","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：美国不关心贫困人口，对他们来说没有任何改变。","the_new_excerpt":"我在这里看了这个感人的视频[https://v.redd.it/pm992ctrg3p61]，是一个女人的。\n她和那些与她有类似经历的人分享了她的旅程。\n生活在贫困之中。读了reddit的评论，让我意识到，没有人在。\n当权者真的关心底层人民... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：美國不關心貧困人口，對他們來說沒有任何改變。","the_new_excerpt":"我在這裏看了這個感人的視頻[https://v.redd.it/pm992ctrg3p61]，是一個女人的。\n她和那些與她有類似經歷的人分享了她的旅程。\n生活在貧困之中。讀了reddit的評論，讓我意識到，沒有人在。\n當權者真的關心底層人民... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-a6eda3a0-184b-54b2-ab6f-6e2382cc0143","excerpt":"LGBT basically covers everything\n\nL (Lesbian): women attracted to women\n\nG (Gay): men attracted to men\n\nB (Bisexual): people of either gender attracted to either gender\n\nT (Trans): people of either gender who feel they are of the other gender\n\nThe only ones I can see fitting in would be intersex and…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/mdcb9m/cmv_every_letter_almost_after_lgbt_is/","title":"CMV: Every letter (almost) after LGBT is meaningless/repetitious","date":"March 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：LGBT后面的每一个字母（几乎）都是无意义的/重复的。","the_new_excerpt":"LGBT基本上涵盖了一切\n\nL（Lesbian）：被女性吸引的女性。\n\nG(Gay)：被男人吸引的男人。\n\nB(双性恋)：被任何一种性别吸引的人。\n\nT(Trans)：觉得自己是另一种性别的人，无论男女。\n\n我觉得唯一适合的是双性人和... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：LGBT後面的每一個字母（幾乎）都是無意義的/重複的。","the_new_excerpt":"LGBT基本上涵蓋了一切\n\nL（Lesbian）：被女性吸引的女性。\n\nG(Gay)：被男人吸引的男人。\n\nB(雙性戀)：被任何一種性別吸引的人。\n\nT(Trans)：覺得自己是另一種性別的人，無論男女。\n\n我覺得唯一適合的是雙性人和... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-1b79a112-7d7c-5ab9-80d0-2cb2f18e4a64","excerpt":"So, it’s a common practice to boil lobsters alive - this is understood, right?\nWe do this for many reason - to maintain freshness, the. ‘aesthetics’ of\nchoosing a lobster out of a tank to eat, the difficulty of actually killing\nlobsters through others means, etc.\n\nBut I really don’t think we should…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/mdnswx/cmv_we_shouldnt_boil_lobsters_alive/","title":"CMV: We shouldn’t boil lobsters alive.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 26, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：我们不应该活煮龙虾。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，活煮龙虾是一种常见的做法--这个大家都懂吧？\n我们这样做的原因有很多--为了保持新鲜度、。的'美感'。\n从鱼缸里挑选出一只龙虾来吃，真正杀死龙虾的难度很大\n龙虾通过别人的手段，等等。\n\n但我真的不认为我们应该... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：我們不應該活煮龍蝦。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，活煮龍蝦是一種常見的做法--這個大家都懂吧？\n我們這樣做的原因有很多--爲了保持新鮮度、。的'美感'。\n從魚缸裏挑選出一隻龍蝦來喫，真正殺死龍蝦的難度很大\n龍蝦通過別人的手段，等等。\n\n但我真的不認爲我們應該... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-a64bac9e-266b-53bb-ad03-c6d93e955afb","previousId":"RedditPost-a6eda3a0-184b-54b2-ab6f-6e2382cc0143","nextId":"RedditPost-1b79a112-7d7c-5ab9-80d0-2cb2f18e4a64","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/md6bmn/cmv_the_us_doesnt_care_about_the_impoverished_and/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
