Basically, I spend a lot of time watching HGTV shows and almost every episode of House Hunters has a moment where someone abruptly decides that they need to remodel an entire home simply because it has carpet. I totally get it, carpet requires a certain degree more maintinance (vacuuming, stain/spill management, etc). The advantages of having carpet don’t seem worth it either (sound proofing, cushioning, warmth during the colder months, etc.) You can totally get most of those benefits by simply wearing house shoes. I understand that Wood floors can be creaky and imperfect in a lot of ways but it is in general much easier to clean. Tile, with the exception of the really well done (and expensive) custom work is usually not that great from an aesthetic and maintinance standpoint. So in my view carpet is the worst, especially if there are pets, smokers, or generally untidy individuals involved. There is clearly some kind of sea change where many home owners don’t prefer carpet as opposed to previous decades where is wasn’t as much of an issue. So, there you go.
