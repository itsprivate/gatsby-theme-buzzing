Merriam Webster defines &quot;sandwich&quot; as &quot; two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between&quot;. By definition, a hot dog is a sandwich, yet there is a debate among us all that hot dogs do not count. In my mind, hot dogs are no different than say a Philly Cheesesteak. Hot dogs are a meat in a bun, therefore they are a sandwich.</p>\n\n<p>Another point that I think is very important is that, if hotdogs are not a sandwich, then what are they? To my knowledge they do not fit into any other food category, at least not as well as they fit into the sandwich category. If we can not define hotdogs as any other type of food, they must be considered a sandwich.</p>\n\n<p>Both hotdogs and hamburgers were created in Germany, both can be as little as one meat between two halves of a bun, yet we generally accept hamburgers as a sandwich, but not hotdogs. I do not see how we can in good faith say that hotdogs are not a sandwich! Either we need to stop considering other foods (such as Philly Cheesesteak) as sandwiches, or we need to definitely, once and for all, conclude that hotdogs are indeed a sandwich.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kt8c8e/cmv_hotdogs_are_a_sandwich/","title":"CMV: Hotdogs are a sandwich","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-09T09:48:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-09 09:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c90a8c59-7619-5138-aae4-8501b6cf614e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kt8c8e/cmv_hotdogs_are_a_sandwich/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kt8c8e/cmv_hotdogs_are_a_sandwich/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Mellow-Mallow","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mellow-Mallow","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Mellow-Mallow","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：热狗是三明治","the_new_excerpt":"我想要一个确凿的论据来反驳我相信的事实，热狗是\n三明治。梅里亚姆·韦伯斯特(Merriam Webster)将“三明治”定义为“两片或两片以上的面包”。\n或者中间有填充物的分裂卷“。根据定义，热狗是一种\n三明治，但是我们所有人都在争论热狗不…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：熱狗是三明治","the_new_excerpt":"我想要一個確鑿的論據來反駁我相信的事實，熱狗是\n三明治。梅里亞姆·韋伯斯特(Merriam Webster)將“三明治”定義爲“兩片或兩片以上的麪包”。\n或者中間有填充物的分裂卷“。根據定義，熱狗是一種\n三明治，但是我們所有人都在爭論熱狗不…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-2bd8b348-16e0-59df-9298-b814b575200a","excerpt":"Was reading some stuff about the Jeopardy GOAT tournament they're doing, and\npeople brought up a Jeopardy-famous moment\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpKOm-LLRhA] from Ken Jennings' original run.\n\n> [Tool Time for 200]\n> \n> This term for a long-handled gardening tool can also mean an immoral…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kt90fy/cmv_ken_jennings_hoe_answer_should_have_been/","title":"CMV: Ken Jennings' \"Hoe\" answer should have been correct.","date":"January 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：肯·詹宁斯的“锄头”回答应该是正确的。","the_new_excerpt":"在读一些关于他们正在做的危险山羊锦标赛的东西，还有\n人们提起了一个危险时刻--著名的时刻\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpKOm-LLRhA]出自肯·詹宁斯的原班人马。\n\n>[工具时间200]\n>\n>这个术语指的是长柄园艺工具，也可能意味着不道德的…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：肯·詹寧斯的“鋤頭”回答應該是正確的。","the_new_excerpt":"在讀一些關於他們正在做的危險山羊錦標賽的東西，還有\n人們提起了一個危險時刻--著名的時刻\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpKOm-LLRhA]出自肯·詹寧斯的原班人馬。\n\n>[工具時間200]\n>\n>這個術語指的是長柄園藝工具，也可能意味着不道德的…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-99740804-2b37-56ae-8b88-0c452019608b","excerpt":"Science and practical experience both show us that humans want ritual, purpose\nand a sense of greater connectedness.
