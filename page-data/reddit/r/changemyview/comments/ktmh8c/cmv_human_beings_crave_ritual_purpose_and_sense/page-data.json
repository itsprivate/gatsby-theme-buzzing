Religions give human beings a framework that addresses these psychological and emotional desires. This is not to say that any given religion is correct or not, but it fulfils something that humans innately seek</p>\n\n<p>Plenty of individual non-religious people can and do live meaningful fulfilling lives, and plenty of religious people live meaningless unfulfilling lives.  But for non-religious people that requires an individual journey of discovery that takes far more effort and time than the pre-established framework that religion offers.  (Although it presumably leads people to individual paths that are better tailored to them personally).</p>\n\n<p>Similarly that sense of greater connectedness - of being part of something larger than yourself - is a task for the individual to try to find on their own.  Again I&#39;d say that plenty of irreligious people find this while plenty of religious people don&#39;t.  <strong>But...</strong></p>\n\n<p>For as long as religion takes people by the hand and guides them to <strong>an</strong> answer, correct or not, while irreligion doesn&#39;t even point people in a general <strong>direction</strong>, religion is going to have a massive advantage winning hearts en masse.  And where hearts go, minds follow.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment about the only thing irreligion has in terms of helping people find ritual, meaning and connectedness is therapy.  Which is expensive, wildly inconsistent and one-on-one.</p>\n\n<p>This is not to say that the irreligious are under any <strong>obligation</strong> to come up with something better. Being an atheist means nothing more or less than non-belief in gods, and irreligion means nothing more or less than not having a religion.</p>\n\n<p>But I feel like, as human beings who care about both ourselves and about other human beings, it benefits us to have <strong>some</strong> sort of structure in place to help us all meet these inherent emotional and psychological desires without either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>having to go with with a package deal of the best answers to these questions that a much earlier, less informed time could supply, or</li>\n<li>a long and arduous unsupported personal search for answers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EDIT: As page0rz rightly points out in the comments, lots of individual organisations or specific philosophies do deliberately have goals and try to foster a communal culture in service of those goals.  I really was thinking in terms of something broader and more generally applicable.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: Political philosophy does fulfil a similar role to religion in terms of making one feel purposeful and connected to a larger community.  It&#39;s also similar in that it tends to allow little flexibility around questioning its core ideology.</p>\n\n<p>I should have said up front that I&#39;d really like to see an alternative to religion that doesn&#39;t fall into the same traps of narrowness, inflexibility and us-vs-them-ism.  To my mind political ideologies fall into those traps.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ktmh8c/cmv_human_beings_crave_ritual_purpose_and_sense/","title":"CMV: Human beings crave ritual, purpose and sense of connectedness to a greater whole.
