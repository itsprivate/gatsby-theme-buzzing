Something along the lines of having to pay works 2-3 times the wages they would have been owed if working in the country the company is based in. As well as having to pay a fine of 100% of the sale value fo the product. Not just profit.</p>\n\n<p>I do not think the idea that &quot;the company did not know about the child labour.&quot; That is used when they hire a smaller company that has any merit as a defence either. Gross negligence is not an excuse for any other crime. And should not be here either. A worker that got hurt due to a ceiling beam would not be unable to sue since the company had no way of knowing water damage had acquired.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 1: I should have been more clear on this. I am specifically referring to when a company send its work to be done by young children in 3rd world countries. Working for next to nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: I am willing to admit defeat on the topic of gross negligence. Why I still do believe that a company that can be proven to know they knew of child labour, I admit I was to casting too broad of a net. As I was only thinking of companies that would try to use smaller companies that they did not technically have affiliation with as a means of circumventing the law. And not of the dozens of reasons that a company may have reasonably done business with a company that was using child labour and they themselves be innocent.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lskxa5/cmv_companys_caught_using_child_labour_even_if_it/","title":"CMV: Companys caught using child labour, even if it is a subsidiary or 3rd party, should face massive fines.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-26T04:35:38.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-26 04:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"4b0bf8fd-fe3e-5219-8a5e-3ef1e1d3ef16","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lskxa5/cmv_companys_caught_using_child_labour_even_if_it/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lskxa5/cmv_companys_caught_using_child_labour_even_if_it/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"ajgjhsgjkhaegjhw","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ajgjhsgjkhaegjhw","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ajgjhsgjkhaegjhw","score":260,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：被发现使用童工的公司，即使是子公司或第三方，也应面临巨额罚款。","the_new_excerpt":"我认为，如果一家公司被发现在第三世界国家使用童工。\n它应该面临绝对巨大的罚款。类似于\n不得不付给工人2-3倍的工资，如果他们在工厂工作的话。\n公司所在的国家。以及必须支付...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：被發現使用童工的公司，即使是子公司或第三方，也應面臨鉅額罰款。","the_new_excerpt":"我認爲，如果一家公司被發現在第三世界國家使用童工。\n它應該面臨絕對巨大的罰款。類似於\n不得不付給工人2-3倍的工資，如果他們在工廠工作的話。\n公司所在的國家。以及必須支付...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ffa013ca-0f60-5682-9e03-cba12c8ef353","excerpt":"Copyright is a brilliant thing, protecting the ideas of an artist, writer or\ndirector.
