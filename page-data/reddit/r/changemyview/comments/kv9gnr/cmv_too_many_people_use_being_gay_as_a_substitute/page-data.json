With that said, I am of the view that too many people in the LGBTQ+ community exhibit their sexuality as the central theme of their personality. I think that while it’s wonderful to see guys showing their feminine and ‘fabulous’ side, this shouldn’t become their defining characteristic. I know that finding and exploring your sexual identity while young is healthy, I don’t feel that people constantly need to hear about your sexual preferences, and often this can drown out actual interesting personality traits. I often hear the rebuttal that ‘straight men do the same’, and while I agree on the basis that men often discuss ‘hot girls’ among other men, they do not plaster the heterosexual flag over their social media and wear tank tops absolutely everywhere. I would be really interested to see what people think about this and whether my mind can be changed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kv9gnr/cmv_too_many_people_use_being_gay_as_a_substitute/","title":"CMV: Too many people use being gay as a substitute for a personality.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-12T15:47:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-12 15:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"5d1c62a7-d9d2-52dd-90b9-0146a22b2172","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kv9gnr/cmv_too_many_people_use_being_gay_as_a_substitute/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kv9gnr/cmv_too_many_people_use_being_gay_as_a_substitute/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"zclcghr","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/zclcghr","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"zclcghr","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：太多人把同性恋作为个性的替身。","the_new_excerpt":"我想在这个帖子的开头说，我非常尊重\nLGBTQ+社区，并深深尊重他们所经历的斗争。使用\n也就是说，我认为LGBTQ+社区中的太多人展示了\n他们的性取向是他们人格的中心主题。我认为…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：太多人把同性戀作爲個性的替身。","the_new_excerpt":"我想在這個帖子的開頭說，我非常尊重\nLGBTQ+社區，並深深尊重他們所經歷的鬥爭。使用\n也就是說，我認爲LGBTQ+社區中的太多人展示了\n他們的性取向是他們人格的中心主題。我認爲…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-1611f69a-94a6-5498-82ce-7a46244f687e","excerpt":"If 10 years ago, you were to tell the average American that the president of the\nUnited States were to be banned from using social media platforms that has\nbillions of users in 10 years, you would be called crazy, and rightfully so.
