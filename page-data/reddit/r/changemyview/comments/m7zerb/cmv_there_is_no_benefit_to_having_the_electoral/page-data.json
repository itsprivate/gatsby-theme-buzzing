Each state has a certain number of electoral votes which aren&#39;t proportionate to their population (less populated states are overrepresented, more populous states are under represented) and its a winner take all system. If you were running for president and won 50.000001% of New York&#39;s popular vote, then you would receive 100% of their electoral votes. This is messed up for several reasons, mainly that the minority parties people&#39;s votes don&#39;t count in reliably blue/red states. I see two ways of fixing this.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Get rid of the winner take all system and replace it with a percentage system. If a democrat won California by 64%, then the republican candidate should get the other 36% of the vote. This would make reliably blue/red states competitive again, and stop nominees from spending 99% of their time and money in just a few battle ground states. It would also help to make the most popular candidate the winning candidate. OR</li>\n<li>Have a simple popular vote system. In the first solution mentioned, one of the issues would be the over/under representation of states based on the population of the state. I am personally of the opinion that the person who the majority of Americans want to be president, should be president.</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m7zerb/cmv_there_is_no_benefit_to_having_the_electoral/","title":"CMV: There is no benefit to having the electoral college.
