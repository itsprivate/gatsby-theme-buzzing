The relevant segment starts at 25:00. </p>\n\n<p>In the call, Trump repeats over and over that he (Trump) believes he won the Georgia election by a large number, “X”. He then over and over implores the Secretary of State of Georgia to change the vote total — but not to a number Trump believes to be true — rather to just enough votes for him to win the state, “Y”.</p>\n\n<p>Imploring the election official to change the total is a felony by <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2016/title-21/chapter-2/article-15/section-21-2-604\">Georgia code title 21 § 21-2-604</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The immediate knee-jerk defense I’ve heard is, “well that doesn’t mean he intended to commit fraud. What if Trump actually just believes what he said? Then he just wants the true total.”</p>\n\n<p>However, even if trump is deluded and believes he actually won, or <strong>even if he had actually won</strong>, he goes on to solicit a fraudulent tally that is neither the real vote total, nor the vote total trump claims to believe that he won by. By his <em>own</em> words. </p>\n\n<p>Trump says:</p>\n\n<p>&gt; &#39;I just want to find 11,780 votes&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Which isn’t even the number he claims to have won by. It states his intent plainly. And that intent is corrupt and violates the law. </p>\n\n<p>It seems uncontroversial given the facts of the case that trump committed this felony  — which by the way comes with a mimimim prison sentence of 1 year. It also seems like the only reason this isn’t getting more coverage as an obvious crime is that it’s already obvious that trump can break the law with impunity.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kvyrf1/cmv_the_trumpgeorgia_election_call_was_clearly_a/","title":"CMV: The Trump-Georgia election call was clearly a felony.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-13T02:58:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-13 02:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"7f89951b-2586-58e3-a0fa-fbb28539ccfb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kvyrf1/cmv_the_trumpgeorgia_election_call_was_clearly_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kvyrf1/cmv_the_trumpgeorgia_election_call_was_clearly_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"fox-mcleod","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/fox-mcleod","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"fox-mcleod","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]。特朗普和乔治亚州的选举电话显然是重罪。","the_new_excerpt":"TL;DL。\n\n在佐治亚州招揽选举舞弊是一种犯罪。\"欺诈 \"意味着它是非法的\n唆使他人将选举计票结果改成一个你知道的数字。\n假的。无论特朗普是否真的相信自己赢得了大选，他所谓的\n佐治亚州州务卿为了把总数改为... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]。特朗普和喬治亞州的選舉電話顯然是重罪。","the_new_excerpt":"TL;DL。\n\n在佐治亞州招攬選舉舞弊是一種犯罪。\"欺詐 \"意味着它是非法的\n唆使他人將選舉計票結果改成一個你知道的數字。\n假的。無論特朗普是否真的相信自己贏得了大選，他所謂的\n佐治亞州州務卿爲了把總數改爲... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-bebc710e-2555-55d3-a4a8-739a6ee481a9","excerpt":"From what I know, Christ was essentially a radical leftist.
