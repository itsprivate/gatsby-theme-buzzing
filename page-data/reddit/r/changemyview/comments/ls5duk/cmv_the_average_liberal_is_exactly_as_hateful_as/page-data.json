Since dehumanization of the other is an important component of narcissism, I would argue that this phenomenon from both US political allegiances is a clear exemplar of societal narcissism.</p>\n\n<p>Change my view!</p>\n\n<p>edit:</p>\n\n<p>So a lot of people are asking me to post sources for my observation that liberal views somehow malign the nuclear family.
