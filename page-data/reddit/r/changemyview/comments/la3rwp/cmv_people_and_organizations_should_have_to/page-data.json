We have overt advertisements, which are annoying, but at least obviously advertisements. But we also have an entire industry of subtle advertisements. Politicians and companies can purchase crowds to flood protests or hearings. They can buy actors to infiltrate these groups and spread a specific message. They can hire people to go on any number of forums to promote a message. All under the guise of someone who honestly believes the message, or as a member of an established community. Frankly, it makes one paranoid to consider that any given moment on a discussion board, that honest discussion you thought you were having about X might actually be with a shill paid for by someone who stands to benefit immensely from X. The presumption of good faith discussion is lost thanks to this industry. </p>\n\n<p>The presumption of good faith discussion is incredibly valuable. It&#39;s what makes the first amendment work. Without that presumption, the first amendment doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s worthless. Therefore, the first amendment should not apply to paid for speech. Anonymizing speech is valuable for genuine held beliefs. But it is not valuable for paid actors. </p>\n\n<p>The most effective way to protect genuine belief holders, and not paid actors is to require any organization that is buying speech to disclose the speech they buy. If an oil company wants to flood the internet with overt and subtle advertisements against hybrid cars, then it should be required to report that within days if not hours of signing the contract with the advertising/shill agency. The reports should be widely and freely available for anyone to check, so they can determine the likelihood of the message they are engaging with being subtle advertising. </p>\n\n<p>Companies that fail to register paid speech should be subject to fines and potentially jail time for corporate officers. Individuals should face the same risks. If fines are the preferred punishment, they should actually be costly enough to make a difference, rather than just being the cost of doing business, but I&#39;m not sure there is a fine costly enough to make a difference. Advertising agencies should be required to also report any paid speech they engage in, which would be all of their business, as a secondary means of catching bad actors.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/la3rwp/cmv_people_and_organizations_should_have_to/","title":"CMV: People and organizations should have to disclose all instances of paying (or otherwise compensating) for another person or organization to speak for them.
