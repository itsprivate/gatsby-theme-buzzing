They simply haven&#39;t given themselves the chance to see the other side in a decent light.</p>\n\n<p>Using myself as an example, I hold values that would probably be in line with every ideology I mentioned at the top, both wings and several others, but I refuse to align myself with any of them because the moment I do, it might change the dynamic of how I analyse information, shift burdens of proof, lead to me engaging in certain groups more exclusively and I might start lose my individual thinking.</p>\n\n<p>I think peoples individual thinking is highly valuable to society and I enjoy this sub alot because it actively tackles the problems I have highlighted by getting opposing views.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t really have anything substantial from a data perspective to back up the above but happy to engage with other people&#39;s opinions and have my view changed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lqpz6r/cmv_mass_subscription_to_political_ideologies_is/","title":"CMV: Mass subscription to political ideologies is killing individual thinking","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T21:30:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 21:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"45fd6433-80f5-525b-9d20-eae20c371e72","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lqpz6r/cmv_mass_subscription_to_political_ideologies_is/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lqpz6r/cmv_mass_subscription_to_political_ideologies_is/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"OLU87","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/OLU87","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"OLU87","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：大众对政治意识形态的认同正在扼杀个人的思维。","the_new_excerpt":"我的看法是，认为自己是左翼、右翼、自由派。\n自由主义者、保守主义者或认同任何政治意识形态都是错误的。\n对于大多数人来说。\n\n事实上，这是一个非常复杂的领域，处理的方法也是非常复杂的。\n围绕着如何管理我们的存在的问题是... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：大衆對政治意識形態的認同正在扼殺個人的思維。","the_new_excerpt":"我的看法是，認爲自己是左翼、右翼、自由派。\n自由主義者、保守主義者或認同任何政治意識形態都是錯誤的。\n對於大多數人來說。\n\n事實上，這是一個非常複雜的領域，處理的方法也是非常複雜的。\n圍繞着如何管理我們的存在的問題是... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-8eaee489-5265-5137-85a8-d7783cf1915b","excerpt":"Yea you heard me, Dandelions\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=dandelions&rlz=1C1CHBF_enSE917SE917&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBuKPn5P_uAhVskIsKHQ1oChYQ_AUoAXoECBcQAw&biw=1646&bih=1280]\nAre the best flowers.\n\nMost people when posed with the question, what is the best flower? would\nprobably…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lqh77o/cmv_dandelions_are_the_best_flowers/","title":"CMV: Dandelions are the best flowers","date":"February 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：蒲公英是最好的花朵","the_new_excerpt":"是的，你听到了，蒲公英\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=dandelions&rlz=1C1CHBF_enSE917SE917&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBuKPn5P_uAhVskIsKHQ1oChYQ_AUoAXoECBcQAw&biw=1646&bih=1280]\n是最好的花。\n\n大多数人当被问到什么是最好的花？\n可能...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：蒲公英是最好的花朵","the_new_excerpt":"是的，你聽到了，蒲公英\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=dandelions&rlz=1C1CHBF_enSE917SE917&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBuKPn5P_uAhVskIsKHQ1oChYQ_AUoAXoECBcQAw&biw=1646&bih=1280]\n是最好的花。\n\n大多數人當被問到什麼是最好的花？\n可能...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-90dc288f-bc2e-5c71-a76f-c12cd4f29004","excerpt":"Lately I've seen a lot of people making this argument, that not only is gender a\nspectrum, but sex is too.
