Usually, they might be doing stuff that a decent sized sedan, wagon or hatchback can do just fine. When you aren&#39;t fully utilizing a big vehicle, they get worse gas mileage and thus pollute more, parking in tight spots can be a pain and bigger isn&#39;t always better when it comes to car wrecks. I get that some people do really need big vehicles (large families, construction workers, etc) but just because you tow an RV once a year doesn&#39;t mean you should drive a Super Duty to work every day. They also aren&#39;t as responsive as smaller vehicles, don&#39;t brake as quickly and can wear out roads more quickly because of their weight.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ktj0hm/cmv_there_are_way_too_many_americans_and/","title":"CMV: There are way too many Americans and Canadians that drive big SUV's and pickup trucks","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-09T11:52:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-09 11:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"c5b554c7-0b9c-5ad3-b7a3-ab8797f90533","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ktj0hm/cmv_there_are_way_too_many_americans_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ktj0hm/cmv_there_are_way_too_many_americans_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"overhardeggs","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/overhardeggs","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"overhardeggs","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：开大型SUV和皮卡的美国人和加拿大人太多了","the_new_excerpt":"实事求是地说，我怀疑每天驾驶F-150战机的人\n定期做一些事情，需要这么大一辆车的咕噜声。\n通常，他们做的事情可能是一辆像样的轿车、旅行车或掀背车。\n可以做得很好。当你没有充分利用大型车辆时，…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：開大型SUV和皮卡的美國人和加拿大人太多了","the_new_excerpt":"實事求是地說，我懷疑每天駕駛F-150戰機的人\n定期做一些事情，需要這麼大一輛車的咕嚕聲。\n通常，他們做的事情可能是一輛像樣的轎車、旅行車或掀背車。\n可以做得很好。當你沒有充分利用大型車輛時，…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-99740804-2b37-56ae-8b88-0c452019608b","excerpt":"Science and practical experience both show us that humans want ritual, purpose\nand a sense of greater connectedness.
