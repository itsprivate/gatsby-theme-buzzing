And yes, the thought behind it I can agree with in that a lot of people are struggling to makes ends meet and this would be a way to help those people. The problem with this in my opinion, is that in turn it hurts small businesses that may not be able to afford to pay everyone $15 an hour so they cut workers, or raise the prices of their goods. I don&#39;t want this to sound like I&#39;m not compassionate, because I am, but a lot of minimum wage jobs aren&#39;t meant for people to make careers out of, the intent is that they get their foot in the door and move on to bigger and better things. UBI would unencumber the businesses from yet more regulation. I&#39;m not talking about businesses such as Walmart, Amazon etc. these companies could easily raise the wage to much higher and be fine. I guess what I&#39;m getting at, is a lot of jobs are automated already, and more jobs are going to go away in favor of automation. Raising the minimum wage, will actually put more people out of work, doesn&#39;t take into account cost of living in various places, and hurts small businesses. The fewer small businesses we have, the less competition there is for the big guys. First time posting on this thread, and genuinely looking for discussion and civil discourse. I&#39;ve seen articles/research supporting both sides of this coin btw. Thanks in advance!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kytupk/cmv_15_minimum_wage_is_actually_not_a_good/","title":"CMV: $15 Minimum wage is actually not a good solution, and Universal Basic Income is a much better alternative.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-17T11:13:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-17 11:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"9e56d224-69de-58ea-bc47-7483e1ec756a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kytupk/cmv_15_minimum_wage_is_actually_not_a_good/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kytupk/cmv_15_minimum_wage_is_actually_not_a_good/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Finkis","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Finkis","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Finkis","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：15美元的最低工资其实不是一个好的解决方案，全民基本收入是一个更好的选择。","the_new_excerpt":"我认为自己是一个温和的民主党人，而且有很多人在谈论一些。\n关于提高最低工资到15元的时间。是的，背后的想法我可以\n同意在很多人挣扎在使生活和这一点。\n会是帮助这些人的一种方式。问题是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：15美元的最低工資其實不是一個好的解決方案，全民基本收入是一個更好的選擇。","the_new_excerpt":"我認爲自己是一個溫和的民主黨人，而且有很多人在談論一些。\n關於提高最低工資到15元的時間。是的，背後的想法我可以\n同意在很多人掙扎在使生活和這一點。\n會是幫助這些人的一種方式。問題是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e254e9a4-5922-56f1-aa80-4941882b2374","excerpt":"I would guess that a typical Democrat gets their news from CNN, MSNBC,\nWashington Post, NYT, etc. And the average conservative gets his news from Fox\nNews, Talk Radio, OAN, Breitbart, The Daily Caller, YouTubers like Stephen\nCrowder and Ben Shapiro, etc. If you go more into the fringes of the right…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kyjzxi/cmv_democrats_and_republicans_live_in_completely/","title":"CMV: Democrats and Republicans live in completely different realities and it is destroying our country.","date":"January 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：民主党人和共和党人生活在完全不同的现实中，这正在摧毁我们的国家。","the_new_excerpt":"我猜测，一个典型的民主党人从CNN、MSNBC获取新闻。\n华盛顿邮报，纽约时报等。而一般的保守派从福克斯得到他的新闻。\n新闻、谈话电台、OAN、Breitbart、The Daily Caller、YouTububers，如Stephen。\nCrowder和Ben Shapiro等。如果你更深入到右派的边缘地带...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：民主黨人和共和黨人生活在完全不同的現實中，這正在摧毀我們的國家。","the_new_excerpt":"我猜測，一個典型的民主黨人從CNN、MSNBC獲取新聞。\n華盛頓郵報，紐約時報等。而一般的保守派從福克斯得到他的新聞。\n新聞、談話電臺、OAN、Breitbart、The Daily Caller、YouTububers，如Stephen。\nCrowder和Ben Shapiro等。如果你更深入到右派的邊緣地帶...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-29d3cf4f-062a-56bc-8fae-fc5fd57fb47a","excerpt":"I am fully supportive of gay and trans right, but I'm growing tired of invented\ngenders or minor sexual preferences hijacking and taking over the LGBT community\nas a vocal minority.
