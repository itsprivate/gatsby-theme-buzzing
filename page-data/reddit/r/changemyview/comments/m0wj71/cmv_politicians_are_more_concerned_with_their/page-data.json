Don’t get me wrong they can be powerful, but having a “tough past” doesn’t make them a good politician/advocate for you. Sure they can sympathize with the poor/oppressed, but if they can’t do anything with that experience/knowledge they are just as bad as the people with no such life experience.</p>\n\n<p>We love a good political clap back. We love watching our side beat up the other side. We love to retweet/repost Twitter burns, opinion pieces, and sound bites that make the other side look dumb. And nothing gets fixed. People like Ted Cruz and AOC rule the news cycle but neither have DONE anything notable. And it’s always the same line “I brought forth aggressive legislation but I was over powered by the bad guys who want to do the same to you!!!”</p>\n\n<p>If they can’t reach across party lines and compromise they aren’t worth re-electing. They don’t care about you, they care about who you think they are and getting their job back. Stop cheering for someone being “fierce” and vote for someone who will do something. Otherwise the divide will get bigger and the pendulum will swing further in both directions and it won’t be the politicians footing the bill. It will be us.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m0wj71/cmv_politicians_are_more_concerned_with_their/","title":"CMV: Politicians are more concerned with their image/getting re-elected than actually making policy change that would help people.
