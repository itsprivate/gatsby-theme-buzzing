The United States specifically separates church and state. Eisenhower put it there after putting “under god” in the pledge of allegiance(which should also be thrown out). </p>\n\n<p>Eisenhower said “In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America’s heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country’s most powerful resource in peace and war.” However, religion is not our most powerful weapon it’s the strength of our democracy and people united together. </p>\n\n<p>Returning to our original motto, “E Pluribus unum” (“out of many, one”) which the founding fathers put there, because they believed strongly in the separation of church and state. </p>\n\n<p>I am a religious person, but there is no need for others to conform to this to be an American, and in no way should we have it at the top of our currency. And don’t think this is people just washing away your faith. You have the freedom of religion and can do what you want, but leave it out of government.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/le2oiz/cmv_the_united_states_should_replace_our_motto_of/","title":"CMV: The United States should replace our motto of “In god we trust” and go back back to “E pluribus unum”.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-06T19:30:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-06 19:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"36e46f5e-5846-598f-8406-c8346e1af258","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/le2oiz/cmv_the_united_states_should_replace_our_motto_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/le2oiz/cmv_the_united_states_should_replace_our_motto_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Scarboyy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Scarboyy","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Scarboyy","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：美国应该更换我们的座右铭 \"我们相信上帝\"，回到 \"E pluribus unum\"。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么要有 \"我们相信上帝\"，因为这只会疏远那些可能不相信的人。\n美国明确规定了政教分离。艾森豪威尔说过\n在誓词中写上 \"在神的庇佑下 \"之后，在那里（也应该是 \"在神的庇佑下\"）。\n抛出）。)\n\n艾森豪威尔说：\"我们以这种方式重申......。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：美國應該更換我們的座右銘 \"我們相信上帝\"，回到 \"E pluribus unum\"。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼要有 \"我們相信上帝\"，因爲這隻會疏遠那些可能不相信的人。\n美國明確規定了政教分離。艾森豪威爾說過\n在誓詞中寫上 \"在神的庇佑下 \"之後，在那裏（也應該是 \"在神的庇佑下\"）。\n拋出）。)\n\n艾森豪威爾說：\"我們以這種方式重申......。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-f6a8e17f-a990-5b24-a878-220140ee3196","excerpt":"I'm not sure what the origins of the term \"mansplaining\" are, however I can see\nno reason why \"explaining\" required a gendered term to describe men being\npatronising or condescending towards women.\n\nI haven't seen any evidence that patronising or condescending behaviour is\nparticularly skewed to one…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ldwptc/cmv_the_term_mansplaining_shouldnt_exist/","title":"CMV: The term \"mansplaining\" shouldn't exist","date":"February 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：\"人肉搜索 \"这个词不应该存在。","the_new_excerpt":"我不清楚 \"人肉搜索 \"这个词的由来，不过我可以看到\n没有理由 \"解释 \"需要一个性别化的术语来描述男人是。\n对女性的高高在上或居高临下。\n\n我没有看到有任何证据表明，对妇女施以恩惠或居高临下的行为是：\n特别是偏向于一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：\"人肉搜索 \"這個詞不應該存在。","the_new_excerpt":"我不清楚 \"人肉搜索 \"這個詞的由來，不過我可以看到\n沒有理由 \"解釋 \"需要一個性別化的術語來描述男人是。\n對女性的高高在上或居高臨下。\n\n我沒有看到有任何證據表明，對婦女施以恩惠或居高臨下的行爲是：\n特別是偏向於一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-c8922b95-4e6c-5864-8417-4a530d57a193","excerpt":"I'm not saying that old people dying isn't tragic or anything, I am just saying\nthat it is more tragic for a young person to die who has their whole life ahead\nof them.
