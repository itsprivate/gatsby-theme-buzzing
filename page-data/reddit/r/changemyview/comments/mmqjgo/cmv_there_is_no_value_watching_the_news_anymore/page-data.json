It&#39;s almost a miracle that news stations are still in business. I realize that advertising is their main source of revenue, but I don&#39;t see the value of people watching events that don&#39;t matter to them. In addition, I find news stations just regurgitate what was already mentioned an hour ago or a day ago with no new insight to share. At this point, you may as well just automate the news reporting if the same content is being said. Why hasn&#39;t news reporting been automated yet? </p>\n\n<p>Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m in the younger generation and I don&#39;t feel the same sentiment the older folks do with reporting and they still want a human to report stuff, but there&#39;s nothing on the news anymore that&#39;s worth watching. Like why would I care about a Twitter war between two politicians that will succumb to nothing or a civil war breaking out on the other side of the world? </p>\n\n<p>Another thing that also bothers me is the misleading headlines. I get that it&#39;s to increase views and attract advertisers, but the way I see it does a disservice to the general public because I&#39;m never going to believe any click bait headline I see anymore and will always be under the impression you&#39;re exaggerating about a topic being reported even though it&#39;s true. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, not watching the news has helped with my mental health. The news seems to focus on spewing negative content more often than the positive work humanity has done, which cycles into this feeling of constant anxiety and depression. It&#39;s not that I want to sanitize the news, but rather to portion the positive vs. negative vs. neutral reporting, so the negative news doesn&#39;t get dominated in the media. I think people tend to forget or dismiss the amazing achievements we&#39;ve made as a species and it gets drowned in all the negative coverage. </p>\n\n<p>Now you may wonder where I&#39;m finding my news then? Honestly, it&#39;s through reddit no joke. However, I only subscribe to my city subreddit because I mostly care about local issues in my area because it&#39;s in some way within my control to get involved. And even then, I don&#39;t pay attention to it too much because I&#39;m preoccupied with other fruitful subreddits like viewing memes, small kittens and cat videos. </p>\n\n<p>The point is at the end of the day the news generally doesn&#39;t provide value to my life anymore. Technology has advanced so much to the point now that I don&#39;t even need to watch the weather on cable anymore when my phone or voice assistant can tell me that. Google search engine is always there if there is a topic I want to get up to speed on a missed topic, and most importantly my local community is there if I need to know something that affects my life. </p>\n\n<p>Really, the only people I know who watch cable news are either the elderly (like my parents) or stock traders. Even for the latter, trading platforms now have a news section to pull on demand if needed. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m hoping a reporter or news media spokesperson can chime in to share their perspective and shift my view.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/mmqjgo/cmv_there_is_no_value_watching_the_news_anymore/","title":"CMV: There is no value watching the news
