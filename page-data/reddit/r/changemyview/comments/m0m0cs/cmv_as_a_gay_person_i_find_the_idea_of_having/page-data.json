Unfortunately, some people look at gay/trans pride and say “Why do they get a whole month/parade for themselves?  Why do they have to be so <em>different</em>?” Instead, we should just get to the point where gay marriage, transitioning, etc is normalized and not viewed as different from everyone else. We’re not. We contribute to society the same way everyone else does. All we want is to be treated with basic human dignity, right? </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I think it’s silly to take pride in one’s sexuality/gender identity in general. It’s not an accomplishment to be gay, it’s something you’re born with, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Those who don’t support the LGBT+ community view it as narcissistic. </p>\n\n<p>To conclude, everyone should be proud of who they are, but in order to achieve true equality we can’t separate ourselves from everyone else.</p>\n\n<p>I mean no disrespect at all, and hopefully my perspective can be changed. I look forward to hearing your opinions!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: That was quick. I’ve changed my perspective on pride.
