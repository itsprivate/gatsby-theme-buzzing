If America supposedly can’t even count votes, how can it at the same time be:</p>\n\n<p>a - a democracy \n  b - “great again”? </p>\n\n<p>11 US Republican Senators (Trump loyalists) are saying the ballots that got them elected are valid, but are also saying those same ballots are not accurate for Joe Biden. </p>\n\n<p>Republicans have lost every challenge in court, including the Supreme Court (with three of Trumps own appointees). Then every state of the Union certified the result, plus, US officials are saying this is one of the safest elections in recent history.
