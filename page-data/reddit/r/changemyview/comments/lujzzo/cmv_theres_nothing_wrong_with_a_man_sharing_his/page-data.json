And that&#39;s cool, do what you need to do to feel safe, i have no issue whatsoever with it.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is when I answer something like &quot;yeah, i did the same thing&quot; and suddenly that&#39;s not ok. Apparently I&#39;m a creep/predator for sharing a woman&#39;s phone number and picture with a trusted friend for safety. </p>\n\n<p>This is really messed up and I would love to have my mind changed.</p>\n\n<p>And this is very problematic from a consent viewpoint. If a woman doesn&#39;t need my consent to share my contact information, why would I need her consent to do the exact same thing?</p>\n\n<p>I know that women have higher risks than men while dating but that doesn&#39;t mean our risk is zero. I should know as I&#39;ve been roofied before while travelling in south america.</p>\n\n<p>And anyways, my risk assessment and how i choose to protect myself  is no one&#39;s business but my own.</p>\n\n<p>I shouldn&#39;t be treated like a creep for doing something most women are encouraged to.
