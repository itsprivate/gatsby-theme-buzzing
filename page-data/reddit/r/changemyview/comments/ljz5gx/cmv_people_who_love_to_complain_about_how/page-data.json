(jk explanation below) </p>\n\n<p>I do understand people’s sentiments about Valentine’s Day being commercialized, because it has been. My issue is, if you’re going to bitch about the commercialization of Valentine’s Day, keep that same energy for every other holiday that has been as well. Cinco de Mayo in the USA has become about drinking and has been renamed “Cinco de Drinko” when the holiday has literally nothing to do with drinking. The same thing can be said about St. Patrick’s Day. Pre-2020, big companies and restaurants, switched the meaning of both days to incentive the public to spend exorbitant amounts of money on alcohol. Mother’s and Father’s Day is basically Valentine’s Day except the former two are more centered on children showing love for their parents. But to input the sentiments people have towards Valentine’s Day,  you should honor and love your parents everyday and not just on that one day! People never call out how \nMother’s Day, especially, is a Hallmark holiday but people will bitch out Valentine’s Day. And don’t even get me started on Christmas!! A capitalists dream day!! I honestly feel like it’s just bitter single people or people in unhappy relationships who want to hate on Valentine’s Day. I don’t have a valentine this year but I still can appreciate the day and i just love love and it makes me happy when I see people highlighting those that they love, even if it isn’t their romantic partner. I just roll my eyes when I see the same people complaining about Valentine’s Day then posting pictures of their Halloween outfits before they go out clubbing for the night (again, pre-2020). Sure people can like Halloween because of the creativity it brings in people who make costumes but Valentine’s Day allows people to be creative in how they celebrate it. Valentine’s Day is no more commercial than any other holiday so why does it get bitched out the most? I also feel like the more recently popularized Galentines Day/Singles Awareness Day have been generally well received in lieu of Valentine’s Day, which is no problem for me (hey, love on your friends and community and love on your single self!) people have no problem treating single Valentine’s Day as a “treat yourself” capitalist day while Valentine’s Day centered on coupledom still gets bitched on...so basically proving my point it’s just cause people who can’t be happy about other people being in happy, healthy relationships and so they use “it’s just so commercialized and i hate capitalism!” as their cover for not being happy for people.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, Happy Valentine’s Day everyone! I hope you’re having an amazing day in spite of your marital status! I hope your day is filled with so much (self, platonic, familial, and romantic) love! \n💖✨♥️</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ljz5gx/cmv_people_who_love_to_complain_about_how/","title":"CMV: People who love to complain about how Valentine’s Day is a capitalist/commercial holiday, but don’t complain about every other holiday are just bitter single people or people in unhappy relationships or people who don’t know how to be happy for other people.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-15T17:05:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-15 17:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"cf82afd9-1a25-5e94-8ca1-78eda05e87bc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ljz5gx/cmv_people_who_love_to_complain_about_how/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ljz5gx/cmv_people_who_love_to_complain_about_how/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Golden_Diva","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Golden_Diva","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Golden_Diva","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：喜欢抱怨情人节是资本主义/商业节日，却不抱怨其他每一个节日的人，都是苦逼的单身人士，或者是恋爱不幸福的人，或者是不懂得为别人幸福的人。","the_new_excerpt":"就是这样，就是这个帖子。(下面JK解释)\n\n我很理解大家对情人节被商业化的感慨。\n因为它一直都在。我的问题是，如果你要抱怨一下\n情人节的商业化，保持同样的能量，为每一个其他的节日。\n假期，已经...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：喜歡抱怨情人節是資本主義/商業節日，卻不抱怨其他每一個節日的人，都是苦逼的單身人士，或者是戀愛不幸福的人，或者是不懂得爲別人幸福的人。","the_new_excerpt":"就是這樣，就是這個帖子。(下面JK解釋)\n\n我很理解大家對情人節被商業化的感慨。\n因爲它一直都在。我的問題是，如果你要抱怨一下\n情人節的商業化，保持同樣的能量，爲每一個其他的節日。\n假期，已經...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-8f60f38e-76e3-5f5f-9c6d-b49e20465053","excerpt":"I'm not talking about merely proposing in a place that happens to be public\n(balconies, waterfalls) where there's just the two of you, I'm talking about\nproposing in front of a crowd that's paying attention.\n\nSeriously, in things like that, you'd want the one you're proposing to to\nprovide the most…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lkewr3/cmv_public_proposals_are_a_big_nono/","title":"CMV: Public proposals are a big no-no","date":"February 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：公开提案是大忌","the_new_excerpt":"我说的不仅仅是在公共场所求婚的事\n(阳台，瀑布)只有你们两个人的地方，我说的是...\n在众人面前求婚 这是在关注。\n\n说真的，在这种事情上，你会希望你的求婚对象是\n提供最...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：公開提案是大忌","the_new_excerpt":"我說的不僅僅是在公共場所求婚的事\n(陽臺，瀑布)只有你們兩個人的地方，我說的是...\n在衆人面前求婚 這是在關注。\n\n說真的，在這種事情上，你會希望你的求婚對象是\n提供最...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-c40ae3c0-5839-5ff7-b44d-c0477724d179","excerpt":"On all the food delivery apps I use, they recommend tipping the driver on a\npercentage of the total bill.
