as: &quot;Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So one can be racist without intending harm (making assumptions about my experiences because I&#39;m black could be an example), but one cannot be racist if they their action/decision wasn&#39;t made using race or ethnicity as a factor.</p>\n\n<p>So for example if a 100m sprint took place and there were 4 black people and 4 white people in the sprint, if nothing about their training, preparation or the sprint itself was influenced by decisions on the basis of race/ethnicity and the first 4 finishers were black, that would be a disproportionate outcome but not racist. </p>\n\n<p>I appreciate that my example may not have been the best but I hope you understand my overall position.</p>\n\n<p>Disproportionate outcomes with respect to any identity group (race, gender, sex, height, weight etc) are inevitable as we are far more than our identity (our choices, our environment, our upbringing, our commitment, our ambition etc), these have a great influence on outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>I believe it is important to investigate disparities that are based on race and other identities but I also believe it is important not to make assumptions about them. </p>\n\n<p>Open to my mind being partly or completely changed!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
