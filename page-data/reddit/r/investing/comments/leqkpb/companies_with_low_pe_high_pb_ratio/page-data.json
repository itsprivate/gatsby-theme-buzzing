To me this sounds like an unusual case. A very high PB ratio indicates that the current price of a stock is high (very high in this case) compared to its book value. However, Apple&#39;s PE ratio is not insanely high at the same price.</p>\n\n<p>This means that Apple is able to generate a lot of revenue &amp; profits with fewer assets that make up book value. Would this inference be correct? If yes, does this somehow pose a problem for Apple&#39;s business in future?  </p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that since Apple outsources all of its production not just to another country but also to another company, this is what is leading to a very low book value.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/leqkpb/companies_with_low_pe_high_pb_ratio/","title":"Companies with low PE & high PB ratio","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-07T23:24:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-07 23:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"leqkpb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/leqkpb/companies_with_low_pe_high_pb_ratio/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/leqkpb/companies_with_low_pe_high_pb_ratio/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"GazBB","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GazBB","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"GazBB","score":68,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"低PE和高PB比率的公司","the_new_excerpt":"我经常会看PE&PB比例来判断自己感兴趣的公司是否有实力。\n按照我的投资策略，是正确的估值。\n\n如果我看一下苹果，它的PE比率是37，PB比率是34。对我来说，这听起来像是\n异常情况。很高的市盈率表明，当前的价格是一个\n股价很高...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"低PE和高PB比率的公司","the_new_excerpt":"我經常會看PE&PB比例來判斷自己感興趣的公司是否有實力。\n按照我的投資策略，是正確的估值。\n\n如果我看一下蘋果，它的PE比率是37，PB比率是34。對我來說，這聽起來像是\n異常情況。很高的市盈率表明，當前的價格是一個\n股價很高...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lm0cj2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm0cj2/robinhood_ceo_has_former_sec_commissioner/","title":"Robinhood CEO has former SEC commissioner prepping him.
