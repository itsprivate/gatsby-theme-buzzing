If we map PE10 below on a graph you can see the historic trend.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/kgaQCY3\">https://imgur.com/a/kgaQCY3</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Are we about to have another Great Depression?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Probably not.</p>\n\n<p>We can see strong multiple growth since the 80s, which if we believe is representative of the new norm and will continue, suggests that we&#39;re actually not drastically far off the trend. Mapping trends during a peak is risky, this graph would look a lot different after a major correction.</p>\n\n<p>In general we&#39;re still a ways off the insanity of the dotcom boom. With only good news coming out short term with stimulus and countries opening back up post covid I don&#39;t see a crash soon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you time the market to buy low sell high?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/DksC60V\">https://imgur.com/a/DksC60V</a></p>\n\n<p>Not easily.</p>\n\n<p>The above graph (orange line) represents selling stocks when PE multiples are 3 above the trend and buying back in when PE multiples are below 3. You can see you massively underperform, that&#39;s before we even count missed dividends. You can find very specific numbers that give you a greater return, but they only work on one specific crash and ofter have you sitting out huge periods that&#39;d cost too much in lost dividends.</p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s possible to reduce losses during downturns through adjustments, but it&#39;s not as easy as looking at one number.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lvtzj4/the_market_is_overvalued_but_not_as_bad_as_some/","title":"The market is overvalued but not as bad as some say","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-02T23:48:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-02 23:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lvtzj4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvtzj4/the_market_is_overvalued_but_not_as_bad_as_some/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvtzj4/the_market_is_overvalued_but_not_as_bad_as_some/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ini0n","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ini0n","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ini0n","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"市场被高估了，但并不像有些人说的那么糟糕。","the_new_excerpt":"这里有很多关于PE比率和大萧条水平的讨论。\n的高估。如果我们把下面的PE10绘制成图，就可以看到历史趋势。\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/kgaQCY3\n\n我们是不是要再来一次大萧条？\n\n也许不会。\n\n我们可以看到80年代以来强劲的倍数增长，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"市場被高估了，但並不像有些人說的那麼糟糕。","the_new_excerpt":"這裏有很多關於PE比率和大蕭條水平的討論。\n的高估。如果我們把下面的PE10繪製成圖，就可以看到歷史趨勢。\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/kgaQCY3\n\n我們是不是要再來一次大蕭條？\n\n也許不會。\n\n我們可以看到80年代以來強勁的倍數增長，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26322089","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26322089","title":"MIT Press has granted full access to all its journals","date":"March 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"麻省理工学院出版社已批准对其所有期刊进行全面访问。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"麻省理工學院出版社已批准對其所有期刊進行全面訪問。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26321962","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26321962","title":"“This destroys the RSA cryptosystem”","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 02, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"\"这破坏了RSA密码系统\"","locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"這破壞了RSA密碼系統\"","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lvtzj4","previousId":"HnPost-26322089","nextId":"HnPost-26321962","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lvtzj4/the_market_is_overvalued_but_not_as_bad_as_some/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
