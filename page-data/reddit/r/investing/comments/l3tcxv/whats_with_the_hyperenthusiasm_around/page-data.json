At the start she was watching videos on Youtube from guys like the Rich Dad Poor Dad fellow, and whenever I&#39;d ask questions about why she trusted these people the answer was something along the lines of &quot;I just do.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Now, the way she talks about it, and the tone she takes when I question how good it is as an investment vehicle is genuinely a bit concerning to me. It feels almost like a conversation with a cultist or one of those MLM pushers, where they seem so certain they&#39;re going to make money and push back on or dismiss basically any suggestion that it&#39;s risky at all, which as far as I&#39;m aware, it is.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that so many crypto-enthusiasts behave like this too, and while I am a bit on the fence about whether or not I want to buy some crypto, this cultist behavior is unsettling to me and pushes me further into the camp of not buying.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve never seen this kind of attitude from anyone other than cultists and MLM pushers yet it seems so prevalent in crypto and because of that I feel really uncomfortable buying into it even though I don&#39;t see that many other downsides. Can someone with more knowledge on this market explain this to me a little? The amount of hype a lot of these crypto guys seem to have just screams &quot;too good to be true&quot; to me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l3tcxv/whats_with_the_hyperenthusiasm_around/","title":"What's with the hyper-enthusiasm around cryptocurrency?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-24T14:10:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-24 14:10","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l3tcxv","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l3tcxv/whats_with_the_hyperenthusiasm_around/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l3tcxv/whats_with_the_hyperenthusiasm_around/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"away_throw_account1","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/away_throw_account1","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"away_throw_account1","score":86,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"围绕加密货币的过度热情是怎么回事？","the_new_excerpt":"所以我有一个朋友最近入手了比特币。一开始她是看\n在Youtube上的视频，从家伙 像富爸爸穷爸爸的家伙，每当我会\n问她为什么要相信这些人，她的回答是这样的：\"我不知道。\n\"我只是做。\"\n\n现在，她谈论它的方式，... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"圍繞加密貨幣的過度熱情是怎麼回事？","the_new_excerpt":"所以我有一個朋友最近入手了比特幣。一開始她是看\n在Youtube上的視頻，從傢伙 像富爸爸窮爸爸的傢伙，每當我會\n問她爲什麼要相信這些人，她的回答是這樣的：\"我不知道。\n\"我只是做。\"\n\n現在，她談論它的方式，... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-la8n7o","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8n7o/fake_news/","title":"Fake news 🤣","date":"February 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"虚假新闻 🤣","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"虛假新聞 🤣","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-25990702","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25990702","title":"FastAPI framework, high perf, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 01, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"FastAPI框架，高精尖，易学易用，快速编码，可用于生产","locale":"zh"},{"title":"FastAPI框架，高精尖，易學易用，快速編碼，可用於生產","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l3tcxv","previousId":"RedditPost-la8n7o","nextId":"HnPost-25990702","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l3tcxv/whats_with_the_hyperenthusiasm_around/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
