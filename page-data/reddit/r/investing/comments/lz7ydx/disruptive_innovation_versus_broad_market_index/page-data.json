They make the case that the coming years are going to be hell for a large segment of the market, due to the type of disruptive innovation that is the focus of ARK’s funds. They position themselves  as a hedge against this activity. I’m aware they are, in a sense, marketing their funds, but I do think there is merit to their case. </p>\n\n<p>My question is, given this context, are broad market index funds as sensible a strategy as they are presented to be? What are some alternatives to incorporate as a hedge against this potential upheaval among stalwarts and the traditional safer harbors in the market?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lz7ydx/disruptive_innovation_versus_broad_market_index/","title":"Disruptive innovation versus broad market index funds","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-07T13:25:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-07 13:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lz7ydx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lz7ydx/disruptive_innovation_versus_broad_market_index/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lz7ydx/disruptive_innovation_versus_broad_market_index/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"toilet_fingers","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/toilet_fingers","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"toilet_fingers","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"颠覆性创新与大盘指数基金的对比。","the_new_excerpt":"正如标题所示，我已经消费了很多ARK Invest的内容。\n迟。他们提出的理由是，未来几年将是一个大的地狱。\n的细分市场，由于该类型的颠覆性创新是。\nARK基金的重点。他们将自己定位为一个对冲...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"顛覆性創新與大盤指數基金的對比。","the_new_excerpt":"正如標題所示，我已經消費了很多ARK Invest的內容。\n遲。他們提出的理由是，未來幾年將是一個大的地獄。\n的細分市場，由於該類型的顛覆性創新是。\nARK基金的重點。他們將自己定位爲一個對沖...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26504131","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26504131","title":"Outrun: Execute local command using processing power of another Linux machine","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"逃跑 使用另一台Linux机器的处理能力执行本地命令。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"逃跑 使用另一臺Linux機器的處理能力執行本地命令。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m7p12v","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7p12v/made_this_for_when_they_ask_how_do_you_afford/","title":"Made this for when they ask \"How do you afford such a big-ass yacht‽\"","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 18, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"当他们问起 \"你怎么买得起这么大的游艇 \"时，就会做这个。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"當他們問起 \"你怎麼買得起這麼大的遊艇 \"時，就會做這個。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lz7ydx","previousId":"HnPost-26504131","nextId":"RedditPost-m7p12v","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lz7ydx/disruptive_innovation_versus_broad_market_index/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
