It posted record revenues of $20bn, record net income of $8bn, and soared to a market cap of $615bn.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>With that being said, if you had invested in Microsoft at the top of the dot com bubble you would not have seen a return on your investment until 2016.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I believe we are now in the midst of a similar timeline. Some valuations are through the roof without any grounding in reality. It is hard to know when it will correct but I am convinced that at some point investors will once again begin valuing companies as the value of their future free cash flows + a risk premium.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason I am adapting my personal investment strategy from 100% long to <strong>110% long and -10% short</strong> with some select picks.</p>\n\n<p>I will be diversifying my shorts and limiting their initial notional value, wary of irrationality continuing. I expect this to be an investment strategy I can stick to for at least 1 year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I&#39;d love to hear any contrarian views to my thesis and any thoughts on my short picks or suggestions.</strong></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>My picks (each will be -1% of my portfolio):</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. TSLA</strong> Not much needed to be said. Great company, love their products and direction. $800bn valuation is ludicrous.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. SHOP</strong> $180bn valuation for $2.5bn revenue in 2020. 70% growth rate is great but where is my risk premium for my investment today?</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. UBER</strong> $113bn valuation with a -$22bn accumulated deficit. Gave up on self driving (their roadmap to profitability?) back in December. Propped up by SoftBank.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. ZM</strong> $126bn valuation with $2bn TTM revenue and $400m net income. Guys, this is a company who offer video communication software. 0 MOAT or risk premium.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. SNOW</strong> $85bn market cap, $489m TTM revenue and -$400m net income. For a data cloud service (hello have you heard of AWS/Azure/etc.?)</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. DASH</strong> $65bn market cap, $2bn revenue, -$200m net income. Financials aren&#39;t the most atrocious on this list but food delivery services (like ride sharing) are too location specific. No roadmap to global domination here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. LMND</strong> $10bn market cap for a &quot;tech&quot; insurance company with less than $100m revenue, -$100m net income. Their S-1 is filled with talk about their AI. Their &quot;chatbot AI&quot; on their website is a web form with a photo of a woman. Seriously?</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Picks I am less bearish on but still considering going short.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. ABNB</strong> $128bn market cap, $5bn revenue pre-covid. This one is hard for me. I like this company and think they have potential as a global business. Also a great pick post-covid. But I think $128bn is still too insane. Could be convinced otherwise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9. NIO</strong> $94bn for the Chinese Tesla. Close to bankruptcy pre-2020 EV hype. Now has some momentum but $94bn worth? China growth can be scary though...</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. SPCE</strong> $13bn valuation. Richard Branson&#39;s pet project run rampant with a Chamath SPAC. Space, very cool. Return on investment is where sorry?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lj4312/some_valuations_are_absurd_i_am_going_10_short/","title":"Some valuations are absurd - I am going 10% short","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-14T02:59:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-14 02:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lj4312","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lj4312/some_valuations_are_absurd_i_am_going_10_short/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lj4312/some_valuations_are_absurd_i_am_going_10_short/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"noodlesource","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/noodlesource","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"noodlesource","score":153,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"有些估值是荒谬的--我将做空10%。","the_new_excerpt":"1999年，微软是一家伟大的公司。它公布了创纪录的200亿美元的收入。\n80亿美元的创纪录净收入，并飙升至6150亿美元的市值。\n\n说到这里，如果你在互联网的巅峰时期投资了微软\n泡沫你要到2016年才会看到投资回报。\n\nI…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有些估值是荒謬的--我將做空10%。","the_new_excerpt":"1999年，微軟是一家偉大的公司。它公佈了創紀錄的200億美元的收入。\n80億美元的創紀錄淨收入，並飆升至6150億美元的市值。\n\n說到這裏，如果你在互聯網的巔峯時期投資了微軟\n泡沫你要到2016年纔會看到投資回報。\n\nI…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lrfxf3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrfxf3/a_m_c_yolo_update_feb_24_2021/","title":"A M C Yolo Update — Feb 24, 2021","date":"February 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"A M C Yolo更新--2021年2月24日。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"A M C Yolo更新--2021年2月24日。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1364683328113238019","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1364683328113238019","title":"GameStop stock doubled today. \n\nWhy?\n\nIt's 2021 - does it really matter?\n\n$GME https://t.co/U0m2cplpGR","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 24, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"今天GameStop的股票翻了一番。\n\n为什么呢？\n\n现在是2021年--这真的很重要吗？\n\n$GME https://t.co/U0m2cplpGR","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"今天GameStop的股票翻了一番。\n\n爲什麼呢？\n\n現在是2021年--這真的很重要嗎？\n\n$GME https://t.co/U0m2cplpGR","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lj4312","previousId":"RedditPost-lrfxf3","nextId":"TweetPost-1364683328113238019","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lj4312/some_valuations_are_absurd_i_am_going_10_short/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
