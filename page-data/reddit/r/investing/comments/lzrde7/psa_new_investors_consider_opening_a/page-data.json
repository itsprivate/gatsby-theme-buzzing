Being young and wanting to see your money grow puts you in an even better situation for the future!  </p>\n\n<p>However, if you aren&#39;t familiar with the tax advantages of a retirement account such as a Roth IRA, I encourage you all to look into how those accounts work, as you can invest in mutual funds and ETFs to gain exposure to various aspects of the stock market to get started.</p>\n\n<p>Maxing out your annual contributions will put you in a fantastic spot down the road! And if you have money left over to invest, definitely open a brokerage account and play the game, but consider tax advantaged accounts first! </p>\n\n<p>Much love to all of you!
