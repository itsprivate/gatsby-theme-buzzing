I knew about all that since it was at around 40$, but only got in around 300$. I haven&#39;t sold anything yet, since I believe I can at least cut my losses if I hold into the long term due the big changes the company will do moving forward. I only put in money I didn&#39;t care if I lost and am not angry about what I could lose if I sell.</p>\n\n<p>I recently bought a couple books about investing and I&#39;m currently reading The Little Book of Common Sense Investing. From what I&#39;ve read so far - and it makes a lot of sense - I should look into buying low-cost ETF&#39;s. </p>\n\n<p>Now, what I still don&#39;t know is how to choose a good ETF, how many to buy, etc. Since I&#39;m really young, I could pick sum more risky ETF&#39;s, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still important to hold bonds and low risk stocks or ETF&#39;s. Also, I would still like to allocate a percentage of my portfolio to individual stocks, where I would do research about the company and decide what to buy specifically. From what I&#39;ve read here so far 80% ETF&#39;S/20% stock would be good?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lcmxym/im_looking_to_learn_about_how_to_create_a/","title":"I'm looking to learn about how to create a diversified portfolio after having gambled away 1500$","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T00:46:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 00:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lcmxym","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcmxym/im_looking_to_learn_about_how_to_create_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcmxym/im_looking_to_learn_about_how_to_create_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Biono03","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Biono03","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Biono03","score":199,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我想学习如何在赌掉1500元后建立一个多元化的投资组合。","the_new_excerpt":"我先说一下，是的，我被拉进了GME的炒作中。我知道\n所有，因为它是在40元左右，但只进了300元左右。我还没有卖\n因为我相信，如果我持有进\n长期来看，由于公司将做大的改变，移...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我想學習如何在賭掉1500元后建立一個多元化的投資組合。","the_new_excerpt":"我先說一下，是的，我被拉進了GME的炒作中。我知道\n所有，因爲它是在40元左右，但只進了300元左右。我還沒有賣\n因爲我相信，如果我持有進\n長期來看，由於公司將做大的改變，移...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1360620128237481989","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1360620128237481989","title":"We are gonna see such a massive experiences spending boom this spring/summer/fall https://t.co/jNfH1XGJYn","date":"February 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"今年春夏秋三季，我们将看到如此大规模的体验消费热潮https://t.co/jNfH1XGJYn。","quoted_status_full_text":"这是坎昆的机场，现在。祝你在1%的债券上好运https://t.co/yD0eoZfoCD。","retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"今年春夏秋三季，我們將看到如此大規模的體驗消費熱潮https://t.co/jNfH1XGJYn。","quoted_status_full_text":"這是坎昆的機場，現在。祝你在1%的債券上好運https://t.co/yD0eoZfoCD。","retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26123726","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26123726","title":"S**tbowl: The algorithmically powered in-home physical caching platform","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 13, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"S**tbowl。算法驱动的家庭物理缓存平台。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"S**tbowl。算法驅動的家庭物理緩存平臺。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lcmxym","previousId":"TweetPost-1360620128237481989","nextId":"HnPost-26123726","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lcmxym/im_looking_to_learn_about_how_to_create_a/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
