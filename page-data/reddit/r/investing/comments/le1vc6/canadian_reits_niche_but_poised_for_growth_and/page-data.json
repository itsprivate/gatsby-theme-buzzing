And if your broker let’s you get to international markets (like Interactive Brokers) this is less of an issue. </p>\n\n<p>Many have great leadership and Trustees. They have solid dividends. Current assets are valued at a discount compared to private market real estate transactions. Balance sheets are great, too. </p>\n\n<p>An example: Granite (GRT.UN). It’s an industrial REIT. Net debt is less than ~30%. Rent collections have been essentially 100% during covid. Yield is 4%. The dividend was just raised. And the units trade on the NYSE. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s a recent article on Canadian REITs from the <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-beaten-down-reits-could-see-negative-sentiment-reverse-quickly-as/\">Globe and Mail</a>.
