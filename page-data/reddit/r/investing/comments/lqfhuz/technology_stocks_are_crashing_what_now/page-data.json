Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it&#39;s frustrating.</p>\n\n<p>It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.</li>\n<li>S&amp;P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.</li>\n<li>DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it&#39;s going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&amp;P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.</p>\n\n<p>If you buy stocks, you&#39;ve got to have conviction in them. You&#39;ve got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they&#39;re &quot;overvalued&quot;. Of course not. I&#39;m going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It&#39;s the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.</p>\n\n<p>Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.</p>\n\n<p>If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You&#39;ve got to have conviction in what you&#39;re buying. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmelade brand. If there&#39;s a 30% discount I&#39;ll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don&#39;t have conviction in your holdings in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>So here&#39;s what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it&#39;s there in the first place. Start with &quot;I own XYZ because...&quot;. Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can&#39;t tell that story, sell it off. It doesn&#39;t belong in your portfolio. Free up that cash so you can pile in when spectacular opportunities arise in future.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lqfhuz/technology_stocks_are_crashing_what_now/","title":"Technology stocks are crashing – what now","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T11:28:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 11:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lqfhuz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lqfhuz/technology_stocks_are_crashing_what_now/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lqfhuz/technology_stocks_are_crashing_what_now/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"trendarchitect","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/trendarchitect","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"trendarchitect","score":3977,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"科技股暴跌--现在怎么办","the_new_excerpt":"刚才有个朋友给我发信息，说他的投资组合损失了10%的价值。\n最近，而且这完全是末日来临。从期货的情况来看，国家质检总局是\n从高点下跌了6.8%（仅今早就下跌了1.8%的缺口）。我明白，这是\n令人沮丧。\n\n值得注意的是，抛售伤...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"科技股暴跌--現在怎麼辦","the_new_excerpt":"剛纔有個朋友給我發信息，說他的投資組合損失了10%的價值。\n最近，而且這完全是末日來臨。從期貨的情況來看，國家質檢總局是\n從高點下跌了6.8%（僅今早就下跌了1.8%的缺口）。我明白，這是\n令人沮喪。\n\n值得注意的是，拋售傷...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lqabal","excerpt":"I think we all agreed about the moving of the us stock market has great impact\non the crypto market, but how about the opposite?\n\nBefore people don’t think crypto market can influence the stock a lot, but now\nthings are changing.\n\nIf we look back to what happening in the last few weeks or months, we…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lqabal/there_could_be_a_feedback_loop_between_crypto/","title":"There could be a feedback loop between crypto market and the stock market","date":"February 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"加密市场和股市之间可能会有一个反馈循环","the_new_excerpt":"我想大家都同意美国股市的走势有很大的影响。\n在加密市场上，但是反过来呢？\n\n以前人们不认为加密市场能对股票产生很大的影响，但现在呢？\n事情正在发生变化。\n\n如果我们回顾一下过去几周或几个月发生的事情，我们... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"加密市場和股市之間可能會有一個反饋循環","the_new_excerpt":"我想大家都同意美國股市的走勢有很大的影響。\n在加密市場上，但是反過來呢？\n\n以前人們不認爲加密市場能對股票產生很大的影響，但現在呢？\n事情正在發生變化。\n\n如果我們回顧一下過去幾周或幾個月發生的事情，我們... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26235414","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26235414","title":"I heat my home by mining crypto currencies","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 23, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"我通过挖掘加密货币给家里供暖","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我通過挖掘加密貨幣給家裏供暖","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lqfhuz","previousId":"RedditPost-lqabal","nextId":"HnPost-26235414","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lqfhuz/technology_stocks_are_crashing_what_now/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
