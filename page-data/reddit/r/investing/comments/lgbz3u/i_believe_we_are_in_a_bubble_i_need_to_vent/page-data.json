Why are they trading at 100x their top line?! Some companies are burning money like never before, have a smaller revenue than before, and are firing people left and right, but they still grew 700%. wtf. Take SPWR as an example, or LMND. I walk past the LMND offices every day, I met Shai Wininger in person. I&#39;m not going to rant about that specific company, but the market is disconnected from reality. LMND has 80M in revenue, burns money, doesn&#39;t grow, but tripled in value in 6 months. Why??</p>\n\n<p>Half of the stock charts that I&#39;m looking at seem normal and then in 2020 they shoot up like never before. You can let a 5 year old pick any 5 stocks and it would have netted you a 30% return on average, easy!</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s happening? This is unprecedented.</p>\n\n<p>I need someone to prove me wrong, or at least provide me with some rationale as to what is happening.</p>\n\n<p>With all of that said, I&#39;m still investing big on margin, but I&#39;m strongly considering changing my portfolio to things that I believe are more solid, and jump out of the 10x bandwagons. I made insane gains last year, but this party can&#39;t go on forever and it needs to come down to earth.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lgbz3u/i_believe_we_are_in_a_bubble_i_need_to_vent/","title":"I believe we are in a bubble [I need to vent...]","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T04:29:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 04:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lgbz3u","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lgbz3u/i_believe_we_are_in_a_bubble_i_need_to_vent/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lgbz3u/i_believe_we_are_in_a_bubble_i_need_to_vent/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ButtFlapMan","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ButtFlapMan","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ButtFlapMan","score":239,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我相信我们是在泡沫中[我需要发泄...]。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我相信我們是在泡沫中[我需要發泄...]。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26199483","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26199483","title":"Diablo II: Resurrected","date":"February 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"暗黑破坏神II：复活","locale":"zh"},{"title":"暗黑破壞神II：復活","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lo4qml","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lo4qml/not_the_hero_we_deserved_but_the_hero_we_needed/","title":"Not the hero we deserved, But the hero we needed. 🙏🏻","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 20, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lgbz3u","previousId":"HnPost-26199483","nextId":"RedditPost-lo4qml","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lgbz3u/i_believe_we_are_in_a_bubble_i_need_to_vent/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
