This can usually be done by holding many stocks in different industries or more simply holding an index. Let me explain why.</p>\n\n<p>There are two kinds of risks. One is systematic risk and the other is non-systematic risk. We can eliminate non-systematic risk through diversification, but not systematic risk. Systematic risk is also called market risk which means it impacts the whole market. For example, this could be due to a hike in interest rates, Treasury Yields rising and etc. This impacts the whole market and cannot be diversified.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is also called non-systematic risk. This is a firm-specific or industry-specific risk. For example, if a company has a product recall, the risk is only for that specific company and not other companies. An industry-specific risk is if the whole industry is shaken by something only impacting that industry. For example, we saw this with oil prices a year ago. Oil companies went down, but other companies weren&#39;t specifically down.</p>\n\n<p>Why does this matter and how does it relate to risk. Well, we can eliminate all non-systematic risk by holding a diversified portfolio. The reason for this is because many stocks won&#39;t be as correlated with one another, which means that any really bad gains can be offset by any really good gains and vice versa. Theoretically, You won&#39;t be exposed to non-systematic risk since you are eliminating it by holding a diversified portfolio. The only risk you have is systematic risk (market risk). Theoretically, we are not compensated by non-systematic risk since it is a risk we can diversify.</p>\n\n<p>Just keep in mind that when you buy industry-specific ETF&#39;s or if your portfolio is concentrated in one sector, you are exposing yourself to more risk than necessary.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lyhqyg/reducing_your_risk_by_diversification/","title":"Reducing Your Risk By Diversification","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-06T07:27:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-06 07:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lyhqyg","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lyhqyg/reducing_your_risk_by_diversification/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lyhqyg/reducing_your_risk_by_diversification/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"moneytobemade8","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/moneytobemade8","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"moneytobemade8","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"通过分散投资降低风险","the_new_excerpt":"降低风险的最好方法之一就是分散投资。这通常可以\n可以通过持有不同行业的多只股票来实现，或者更简单地持有一只。\n指数。让我解释一下原因。\n\n风险有两种。一种是系统性风险，另一种是\n非系统性风险。我们可以消除...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"通過分散投資降低風險","the_new_excerpt":"降低風險的最好方法之一就是分散投資。這通常可以\n可以通過持有不同行業的多隻股票來實現，或者更簡單地持有一隻。\n指數。讓我解釋一下原因。\n\n風險有兩種。一種是系統性風險，另一種是\n非系統性風險。我們可以消除...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lyn6aw","excerpt":"As you can see on the chart, the major indices - S&P500, Dow, and Nasdaq all\nbounced from its lows around 11:30am and just kept trending upward until the\nclose.
