I graduated in April 2020, and started working in May. My annual salary is around 80-85K. I just turned 25. </p>\n\n<p>I have around 50K ready to be used. I’m thinking of keeping 5k for emergency fund reasons. </p>\n\n<p>I was thinking of just putting in 45k spread across various ETFs in a roboadvisor. I’m a fairly new investor so I’m still learning.</p>\n\n<p>My friend on the other hand has made a lot of money with successful investments. He’s won big with Shopify, NVIDIA, Amazon, etc. Easily has over $300K now in assets. He kinda inspires me. Lol. He tells me that at the annual return rate of even 10% per year for ETF’s is nothing. Doesn’t excite him. But he told me I need to really do my research on individual stocks if I were to purchase them. </p>\n\n<p>On the OTHER hand, I was just thinking why not just save up money and move out eventually? But the thing is... my lifestyle at this current moment doesn’t really call for a drastic move like moving out. I live at my dads and I don’t pay rent/food. I do feel like sometimes I’m missing out? But that feeling goes away.</p>\n\n<p>What do you guys think? Would love to hear advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ko2dns/thinking_of_investing_50k_i_savedneed_advice/","title":"Thinking of investing 50K I saved...need advice?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-01T11:35:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-01 11:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ko2dns","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ko2dns/thinking_of_investing_50k_i_savedneed_advice/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ko2dns/thinking_of_investing_50k_i_savedneed_advice/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"SACREDDmusic","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SACREDDmusic","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"SACREDDmusic","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"想把我攒下的5万块钱拿去投资…需要建议吗？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿伙计们。\n\n我终于还清了我的学生贷款(30K美元)。我很幸运在伦敦找到了一份工作。\n今年毕业。我于2020年4月毕业，5月开始工作。我的\n年薪在80-85K左右。我刚满25岁。\n\n我有大约50K可以使用。我在考虑给…留5000块钱","locale":"zh"},{"title":"想把我攢下的5萬塊錢拿去投資…需要建議嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿夥計們。\n\n我終於還清了我的學生貸款(30K美元)。我很幸運在倫敦找到了一份工作。\n今年畢業。我於2020年4月畢業，5月開始工作。我的\n年薪在80-85K左右。我剛滿25歲。\n\n我有大約50K可以使用。我在考慮給…留5000塊錢","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25594068","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25594068","title":"Ask HN: Predictions for 2021?","date":"January 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"HN提问：对2021年的预测？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"HN提問：對2021年的預測？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-25598270","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25598270","title":"Reverse Engineering Source Code of the Biontech Pfizer Vaccine: Part 2","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 01, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"生物技术辉瑞疫苗的反向工程源代码：第二部分","locale":"zh"},{"title":"生物技術輝瑞疫苗的反向工程源代碼：第二部分","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-ko2dns","previousId":"HnPost-25594068","nextId":"HnPost-25598270","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ko2dns/thinking_of_investing_50k_i_savedneed_advice/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","386998304","4203388852"]}
