But would like to be invested in fintech.  Between Sq and Paypal was always more interested in Sq.  With the drop is now a good time to buy and hold?  Or is the valuation still too rich?  Numbers look solid imo.  The bitcoin purchase of 170 million doesn&#39;t seem that much in the grand scheme of things.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m Canadian and don&#39;t use cashapp or the Paypal version so ppl who use it and their opinions would be nice as well.  Or any other recommendations in the fintech space.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lqtwws/square_4th_quarter_earnings/","title":"Square 4th quarter earnings","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-24T02:36:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-24 02:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lqtwws","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lqtwws/square_4th_quarter_earnings/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lqtwws/square_4th_quarter_earnings/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"smokeyjay","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/smokeyjay","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"smokeyjay","score":170,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Square第四季度财报","the_new_excerpt":"Square $SQ [https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SQ&src=cashtag_click] 2020年第四季度。\n盈利主题\n\n营收：31.6亿+141%同比增长\n\nEPS 0.32美元，预期0.24美元。\n\n毛利：8.04亿元+52% 同比增长\n\n净收入：2.94亿美元，同比3.91亿美元。\n\n现金应用月活跃用户。3600万+50%同比增长\n\n现金应用...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Square第四季度財報","the_new_excerpt":"Square $SQ [https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SQ&src=cashtag_click] 2020年第四季度。\n盈利主題\n\n營收：31.6億+141%同比增長\n\nEPS 0.32美元，預期0.24美元。\n\n毛利：8.04億元+52% 同比增長\n\n淨收入：2.94億美元，同比3.91億美元。\n\n現金應用月活躍用戶。3600萬+50%同比增長\n\n現金應用...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1367886525099294720","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1367886525099294720","title":"RT @awealthofcs: Investors in 2020:\n\nBeating the stock market is easy\n\nThe stock market in 2021: https://t.co/XriBR2rTBe","date":"March 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @awealthofcs: 2020年的投资者：\n\n打败股市很容易\n\n2021年的股市：https://t.co/XriBR2rTBe","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"投资者在2020年。\n\n战胜股市很容易\n\n2021年的股市：https://t.co/XriBR2rTBe"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @awealthofcs: 2020年的投資者：\n\n打敗股市很容易\n\n2021年的股市：https://t.co/XriBR2rTBe","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"投資者在2020年。\n\n戰勝股市很容易\n\n2021年的股市：https://t.co/XriBR2rTBe"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1367875442628263940","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1367875442628263940","title":"\"Hi mom, margin is on the phone and they would like to speak with you.\"\n\n-Liam, Robinhood trader since April 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 05, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"\"嗨，妈妈，保证金在电话里，他们想和你谈谈。\"\n\n-Liam，Robinhood交易员，自2020年4月起。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"\"嗨，媽媽，保證金在電話裏，他們想和你談談。\"\n\n-Liam，Robinhood交易員，自2020年4月起。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lqtwws","previousId":"TweetPost-1367886525099294720","nextId":"TweetPost-1367875442628263940","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lqtwws/square_4th_quarter_earnings/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
