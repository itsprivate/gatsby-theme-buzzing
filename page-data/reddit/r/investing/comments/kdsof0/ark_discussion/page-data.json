As many of you probably know, Cathy&#39;s investment strategy is based on Wright&#39;s law, which states that for every cumulative doubling of units produced, costs decline at a consistent rate. According to Cathy, ARK&#39;s research strategy starts by discovering when the costs in various innovative industries have declined to a low enough point to indicate exponential growth in that industry, and therefore the leading companies in that industry. </p>\n\n<p>Seems simple enough, but I&#39;m curious as to how a retail investor would ever be able to find the relevant information to use a similar strategy. I can only assume that ARK has tons of research vehicles in play to analyze how quickly costs change and at what price level customers will start entering into the market. I&#39;ve been trying to think if there is a way to find this information in a companies financials, maybe hidden within some relationship of numbers but I just don&#39;t know.</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody have anything to contribute? I&#39;m really just curious if other people have gone down this path and whether they have gotten anywhere with it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kdsof0/ark_discussion/","title":"ARK discussion","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 16, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-16T06:42:40.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-16 06:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kdsof0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kdsof0/ark_discussion/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kdsof0/ark_discussion/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"gravy_train99","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/gravy_train99","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"gravy_train99","score":80,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"方舟讨论","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，\n\n像你们中的许多人一样，我一直在关注凯西·伍兹和方舟投资公司\n最近。你们中的许多人可能都知道，凯西的投资策略是基于\n赖特定律指出，单位产量每累计翻一番，\n成本以一致的速度下降。据凯西说，…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"方舟討論","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，\n\n像你們中的許多人一樣，我一直在關注凱西·伍茲和方舟投資公司\n最近。你們中的許多人可能都知道，凱西的投資策略是基於\n賴特定律指出，單位產量每累計翻一番，\n成本以一致的速度下降。據凱西說，…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ko5xhn","excerpt":"What stocks, etf's, or other investments are you looking to add to your\nportfolio this year?
