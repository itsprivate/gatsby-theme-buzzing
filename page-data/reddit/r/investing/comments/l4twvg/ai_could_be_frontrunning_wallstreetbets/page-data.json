The AI combs through mountains of data (expressly including social media and regular news reporting). When I heard about it, I was originally dubious about its ability to beat a relatively efficient market based on searching through this dataset, but I was curious. So I bought a little bit when it debuted, and it didn&#39;t do much of anything, and indeed kinda underperformed so I lost patience and sold it. But I remember an AI podcast I heard that talked about machine learning and how early on (with Chess, or Go, or other tests), humans would beat the AI easily. But then over time, AI progressively learned and then became unbeatable. So I took a flyer and bought back into AIEQ in early November and continued to leg into the position, and it continues to do well. I ran a three month chart vs. SPY and Vanguard&#39;s Total Stock Index. It is beating both handily. (This is true on longer time periods also, but I didn&#39;t own it before November). Moreover, the outperformance seems to be accelerating, which could mean the AI is learning and improving as it goes.</p>\n\n<p>That outperformance raised my eyebrows, and I was surprised that this dataset had in fact yielded actionable alpha. Then I heard about wallstreetbets. And then I made the connection - AIEQ may be outperforming because it is reading all the Reddit trade discussion, and is following or perhaps even front-running those trades. If you look at AIEQ&#39;s top portfolio positions, they are full of Reddit faves like TSLA, ENPH, SPWR, AMD, ROKU, ETSY, SQ, MRNA, ZS, CRWD, PLUG, etc. I don&#39;t know if my theory is correct (the AI trading methodology is a black box), but it&#39;s certainly food for thought.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l4twvg/ai_could_be_frontrunning_wallstreetbets/","title":"AI could be front-running WallStreetBets","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T15:47:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 15:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l4twvg","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l4twvg/ai_could_be_frontrunning_wallstreetbets/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l4twvg/ai_could_be_frontrunning_wallstreetbets/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"NisusAvatar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/NisusAvatar","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"NisusAvatar","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"AI可能成为华尔街赌局的前锋","the_new_excerpt":"有一种ETF，是基于人工智能进行交易的（行情。\nAIEQ）。) 人工智能梳理了海量的数据（明确包括社交媒\n和常规新闻报道）。) 当我听到这个消息的时候，我原本是疑惑的。\n关于其能否战胜一个相对有效的市场，基于...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"AI可能成爲華爾街賭局的前鋒","the_new_excerpt":"有一種ETF，是基於人工智能進行交易的（行情。\nAIEQ）。) 人工智能梳理了海量的數據（明確包括社交媒\n和常規新聞報道）。) 當我聽到這個消息的時候，我原本是疑惑的。\n關於其能否戰勝一個相對有效的市場，基於...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lbybnz","excerpt":"Just wanted everyone to take a look at this write up DD below.\n\nHope it helps bring some clarity.
