I was reading about the dip today in the indexes. Apparently hedge funds across the world are selling many long positions to cover their short exposure (regardless of exposure to GME). This deleveraging has cause a broad decline as these funds/markets deleverage their holdings.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure how long this secular trend will happen but thought I would post about it to get opinions. Does the dip continue? Is there more money somewhere that will come “buy the dip”? Or are we dealing with a prolonged period of depressed stock prices (no new all-time-highs on the horizon).</p>\n\n<p>The article below summarizes this. Are you buying this dip? Or waiting to see where the bottom is? Any clue as to how much leverage needs to come out before the market stabilizes?</p>\n\n<p>Hedge Funds Slashing Equity Exposure at Fastest Pace Since 2014<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/hedge-fund-favorites-are-telltale-leaders-in-broad-stock-selloff\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/hedge-fund-favorites-are-telltale-leaders-in-broad-stock-selloff</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l6qcpe/market_deleveraging_due_to_short_squeeze/","title":"Market Deleveraging due to Short Squeeze","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-28T16:04:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-28 16:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l6qcpe","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l6qcpe/market_deleveraging_due_to_short_squeeze/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l6qcpe/market_deleveraging_due_to_short_squeeze/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"LOLeverage","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LOLeverage","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"LOLeverage","score":106,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"空头挤压导致的市场去杠杆化。","the_new_excerpt":"这里的新用户，但我真的越来越欣赏这里的社区。我是\n读到今天指数的跳水。显然，对冲基金跨\n世界各地都在卖出许多多头头寸来弥补他们的空头风险（不管是什么原因）。\n的风险敞口GME)。这种去杠杆化造成了大盘下跌...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"空頭擠壓導致的市場去槓桿化。","the_new_excerpt":"這裏的新用戶，但我真的越來越欣賞這裏的社區。我是\n讀到今天指數的跳水。顯然，對沖基金跨\n世界各地都在賣出許多多頭頭寸來彌補他們的空頭風險（不管是什麼原因）。\n的風險敞口GME)。這種去槓桿化造成了大盤下跌...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26036695","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26036695","title":"Chromium cleans up its act and daily DNS root server queries drop by 60B","date":"February 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Chromium清理行为，DNS根服务器日查询量下降60B。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Chromium清理行爲，DNS根服務器日查詢量下降60B。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ld4yet","excerpt":"Go nuts, it’s Friday, bitches","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld4yet/gme_whats_a_memestonk_daily_qa_panel_2521/","title":"GME (what’s a memestonk?) daily Q&A panel 2/5/21","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 05, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME(什么是memestonk?)每日问答板块2/5/21。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME(什麼是memestonk?)每日問答板塊2/5/21。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l6qcpe","previousId":"HnPost-26036695","nextId":"RedditPost-ld4yet","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l6qcpe/market_deleveraging_due_to_short_squeeze/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
