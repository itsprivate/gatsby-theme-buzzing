We’ve just got to get quicker, better, faster. ... As you look at what we’ve done, you’d say we’ve done a good job, but the other people have done a good job, too.”  </p>\n\n<p>Dimon’s blunt assessment was in response to questions from analysts including Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo who pointed out that with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/disruptors-paypal-and-square-surpass-wall-street-giants-including-goldman-sachs-in-market-cap.html\">rich, tech-like valuations</a>, fintech players have “trounced” the traditional banks in recent years.  </p>\n\n<p>Dimon said he sent his deputies a list of global competitors, and that PayPal, Square, Stripe, Ant Financial as well as U.S. tech giants including <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN\">Amazon</a>, Apple and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GOOGL\">Google</a> were names the bank needs to keep an eye on. The rivals are also clients of JPMorgan’s commercial and investment banking in many cases, he added.  </p>\n\n<p>Competition will be particularly tight in the world of payments, he said: “I expect to see very, very tough, brutal competition in the next 10 years,” Dimon said. “I expect to win, so help me God.”  </p>\n\n<p>Dimon added that in some cases, the new players were “examples of unfair competition” that the bank would do something about eventually. He included players that take advantage of richer debit-card revenue for small banks and firms Dimon accused of not taking precautions against money laundering.  </p>\n\n<p>He specifically called out Plaid, the payments start-up whose acquisition by Visa recently collapsed, saying “people who improperly use data that’s been given to them, like Plaid.”  </p>\n\n<p>Plaid CEO Zach Perret declined to directly respond to the accusation during an <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/15/plaid-ceo-on-how-its-5-point-3-billion-deal-with-visa-fell-through.html\">interview</a> with CNBC’s David Faber, adding that Plaid is spending time with the bank on a partnership.  </p>\n\n<p>When contacted for further comment, a Plaid spokeswoman said the company is “focused on ensuring people have access to their own financial information so they can securely share it with permission in order to use the fintech apps they choose.”  </p>\n\n<p>She added that “data privacy and security are core to everything we do, including the data exchange agreements we have with JPMorgan Chase among many other banks.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/jamie-dimon-says-jpmorgan-chase-should-absolutely-be-scared-s-less-about-fintech-threat.html\">Original CNBC article</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ky3jty/jamie_dimon_says_jpmorgan_chase_should_absolutely/","title":"Jamie Dimon says JPMorgan Chase should absolutely be ‘scared s---less’ about fintech threat","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-16T00:04:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-16 00:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ky3jty","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ky3jty/jamie_dimon_says_jpmorgan_chase_should_absolutely/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ky3jty/jamie_dimon_says_jpmorgan_chase_should_absolutely/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ChocolateTsar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChocolateTsar","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ChocolateTsar","score":1664,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"杰米-戴蒙表示，摩根大通绝对应该对金融科技的威胁 \"不害怕\"。","the_new_excerpt":"> 关键点\n> \n> 杰米-戴蒙对3.4万亿美元银行业巨头管理团队的寄语。\n>摩根大通。害怕金融科技的竞争对手。\n> \n> \"我们绝对不应该害怕，\"Dimon告诉分析师。\n> \n> 迪蒙表示，他给自己的副手发了一份全球竞争对手的名单，并...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"傑米-戴蒙表示，摩根大通絕對應該對金融科技的威脅 \"不害怕\"。","the_new_excerpt":"> 關鍵點\n> \n> 傑米-戴蒙對3.4萬億美元銀行業巨頭管理團隊的寄語。\n>摩根大通。害怕金融科技的競爭對手。\n> \n> \"我們絕對不應該害怕，\"Dimon告訴分析師。\n> \n> 迪蒙表示，他給自己的副手發了一份全球競爭對手的名單，並...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25917466","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25917466","title":"Backblaze Hard Drive Stats for 2020","date":"January 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"2020年的Backblaze硬盘统计数据","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2020年的Backblaze硬盤統計數據","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l54gji","excerpt":"What if this is the new standard?\n\nWhat if with COVID, people realized they had a lot of unused money laying around\nand they decided to invest it in stock, bitcoin, gold and even collectibles\n(pokémon, magic and figures have seen huge spikes on extra-rare items).\n\nOf course, there is the side of…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l54gji/what_if_this_was_not_a_bubble_but_a_price/","title":"What if this was not a bubble - but a price correction?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 26, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果这不是泡沫--而是价格修正呢？","the_new_excerpt":"如果这是新的标准呢？\n\n如果有了COVID，人们意识到他们有很多闲置的钱，怎么办？\n他们决定将其投资于股票、比特币、黄金甚至收藏品上\n(pokémon、魔法和人偶的特级品出现了巨大的飙升)。\n\n当然，还有一方面是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果這不是泡沫--而是價格修正呢？","the_new_excerpt":"如果這是新的標準呢？\n\n如果有了COVID，人們意識到他們有很多閒置的錢，怎麼辦？\n他們決定將其投資於股票、比特幣、黃金甚至收藏品上\n(pokémon、魔法和人偶的特級品出現了巨大的飆升)。\n\n當然，還有一方面是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-ky3jty","previousId":"HnPost-25917466","nextId":"RedditPost-l54gji","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ky3jty/jamie_dimon_says_jpmorgan_chase_should_absolutely/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
