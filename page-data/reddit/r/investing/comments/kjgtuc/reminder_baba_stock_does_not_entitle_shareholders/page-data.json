Seems like the massive drop in share price now should be a fantastic opportunity to pick up the Amazon of China at only a forward P/E of 18 right? Not exactly.</p>\n\n<p>This has been posted before in less detail, but I think it&#39;s important to remind investors of the current circumstances arising during the anti-trust probe with China.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why BABA is nose-diving on any extra news of government involvement is that BABA represents ownership of a shell company in the cayman islands, not actually Alibaba itself. The shell company doesn&#39;t even have ownership of Alibaba&#39;s equity. If you want proof of this, simply open up any of their financial statements filed with the SEC.</p>\n\n<p>Chinese law forbids foreigners from owning strategic assets in the country, and Alibaba wouldn’t be able to keep its licenses if, say, a U.S. hedge fund directly bought into the company.  Basically, the Alibaba stock will buy you a stake in a Cayman Islands-registered entity that is under contract to receive the profit from Alibaba&#39;s Chinese assets but will not actually own them.</p>\n\n<p>So think about this, if Chinese laws prohibit foreigners from owning/investing in these kinds of assets in China, what would protect the shell company in the Caymans from enforcing their contract to receive profits from Alibaba if shit hit the fan with the CCP? If Alibaba gets broken up during anti-trust probes, how do we know which subsidiaries BABA ( the shell company in the caymans) will be contractually obligated to receive profits from? Heck, is this contract to receive profits even enforceable in China, where the law clearly states foreigners can&#39;t own strategic investments?</p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t know the answers to the above questions. BABA could easily be worth 0$ if investors one day decide that the &quot;contract&quot; to receive profits from Alibaba is basically BS.</p>\n\n<p>Alibaba and Chinese executives come out a winner either way. Alibaba was able to raise billions from foreign investors without giving up a single bit of ownership.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, by the way, all Chinese listed companies on US exchanges are listed as Cayman shell companies, this isn&#39;t specific to Alibaba. Baidu and JD are set up the same way.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kjgtuc/reminder_baba_stock_does_not_entitle_shareholders/","title":"Reminder: BABA stock does NOT entitle shareholders to equity in Alibaba","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 24, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-24T16:59:45.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-24 16:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kjgtuc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kjgtuc/reminder_baba_stock_does_not_entitle_shareholders/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kjgtuc/reminder_baba_stock_does_not_entitle_shareholders/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"kimjungoon","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/kimjungoon","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"kimjungoon","score":3337,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"提醒：巴巴股票并不赋予股东阿里巴巴股权的权利","the_new_excerpt":"我看到很多用户在阿里巴巴上发布DD，并对\n它。看起来现在股价的大幅下跌应该是一个奇妙的\n仅以18倍的市盈率就有机会收购中国的亚马逊，对吗？\n不完全同意。\n\n这个帖子以前也有过不太详细的内容，但我认为…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"提醒：巴巴股票並不賦予股東阿里巴巴股權的權利","the_new_excerpt":"我看到很多用戶在阿里巴巴上發佈DD，並對\n它。看起來現在股價的大幅下跌應該是一個奇妙的\n僅以18倍的市盈率就有機會收購中國的亞馬遜，對嗎？\n不完全同意。\n\n這個帖子以前也有過不太詳細的內容，但我認爲…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25707410","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25707410","title":"Apple Removes Parler from App Store","date":"January 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"苹果将Parler从App Store中移除","locale":"zh"},{"title":"蘋果將Parler從App Store中移除","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ku17wx","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ku17wx/tsla_and_nio_to_the_moon_boys/","title":"TSLA and NIO to the moon boys 🚀🚀","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 10, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"TSLA和NIO to the Moon Boys🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"TSLA和NIO to the Moon Boys🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kjgtuc","previousId":"HnPost-25707410","nextId":"RedditPost-ku17wx","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kjgtuc/reminder_baba_stock_does_not_entitle_shareholders/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
