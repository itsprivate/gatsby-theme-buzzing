Yet, everyday you see posts about what&#39;s next to buy, what&#39;s gonna crash the stock market, or why this market doesn&#39;t make sense when the economy is in the dumpster. At the end of day, most people here don&#39;t have the stomachs to withstand when actual correction comes. A lot of people don&#39;t know what they own.
