Sony is an 800lb gorilla sitting on multiple industries. Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT.</strong></p>\n\n<p>- Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn&#39;t even come close to amount of sales in the home space.</p>\n\n<p>- There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter.</p>\n\n<p>-In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any       small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads.</p>\n\n<p>- SNE won&#39;t enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch.</p>\n\n<p>- The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants. This is the $SNE way. Let the fools look for gold,</p>\n\n<p>*In millions of yen</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Gained YOY .57 Trillion increase in cash and cash equivalents (20.24%) Gives room to experiment with new business models to possibly  enter the EV space as a supplier</li>\n<li>In the last few quarters didn’t sell PS5s, but spent lots of R&amp;D in it.</li>\n<li>Reduction of bad accounts receivables by 1/3rd.</li>\n<li>Sales for PS4 increased YOY -&gt; convertible into PS5 sales</li>\n<li>Operating income from gaming almost doubled\n\n<ul>\n<li>64,987 -&gt; 104,932</li>\n<li>Gaming accounts for 23.2% -&gt; 33% of income BEFORE PS5 SALES</li>\n<li>Pictures decreased by 20%\n\n<ul>\n<li>Will recover after covid</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Decreased images/optics sales due to supply issues\n\n<ul>\n<li>Decrease of 34.7%</li>\n<li>$SNE owns over 50% of the market share</li>\n<li>Previously YOY increase of 25%</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>P/E ratio is still 14 despite stock price growth\n\n<ul>\n<li>EPS last quarter $3.47 a <strong>285.56% surprise</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Without PS5 sales</strong></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>10 Million ps4 sales previous Jn-Jn fiscal year</li>\n<li>PS5 sales 4.2 million since November.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Expectations of 18 million YOY.</li>\n<li>Increased revenue from future game sales price being 10$ more than previous cycles.</li>\n<li>Clearly dominates the home console market globally.</li>\n<li>At one point 3,368,098 units, while the <strong>Xbox Series X</strong>/S <strong>sold</strong> 1,817,303.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>PS5 yields will increase over time assuming AMD can obtain increased capacity from TSMC.
