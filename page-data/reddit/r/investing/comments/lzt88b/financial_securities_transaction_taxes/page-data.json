Most are in the realm of a 0.1% tax on equities and bonds and a smaller tax on derivatives.  The estimated revenue from this tax varies based on who you ask, somewhere between a few hundred billion to upwards of 1 trillion over a decade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Securities Transaction Taxes and Market Quality</strong> studies the transaction tax levied in NY in the bulk of the 1900s. It&#39;s interesting in that it studies the same market as the proposed tax, but the NY tax was local and had a side effect of pushing volumes to other venues (AMEX) which wouldn&#39;t occur in a national STT. It can be found here for download or viewing for free: <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract%5C_id=1980185\">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=1980185</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Results</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Portfolio Volatility - results suggest portfolio does not move in opposite direction of STT levels (counter to views of tax proponents).</li>\n<li>Bid/Ask Spreads - They use a proxy measure as bid/ask spreads aren&#39;t available for the time period, but find a positive relationship between STT and bid/ask spread width.</li>\n<li>Volumes - In 8/9 STT changes, volume moved in the opposite direction of the STT changes when an alternative (AMEX) was available. When there was no alternative (NYSE or don&#39;t trade), 4/9 cases had a statistically significant reduction in volume while 5/9 were not statistically significant in either direction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Generally, the study found that STTs have an inverse relationship with market quality.  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Securities Transactions Taxes and Financial Markets</strong> published by the IMF is a somewhat more general paper, but for a period focuses on Sweden’s experiment with STTs for about eight years. It can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2001/wp0151.pdf\">https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2001/wp0151.pdf</a>  </p>\n\n<p>Sweden:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Taxes levied were 1% on stocks and 2% on options round trip.</li>\n<li>Revenue was disappointing, with widespread avoidance being a major reason. Foreign investors placed orders in NY and London, Domestic investors established off-shore accounts to use foreign brokers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>General Conclusions: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>STTs increase price volatility</li>\n<li>STTs increase demand for derivatives, decrease demand for stocks and bonds.</li>\n<li>STTs decrease volumes</li>\n<li>STTs are similar to capital controls, and both suffer from implementation and enforcement problems</li>\n<li>STTs can obstruct price discovery and stabilization and inhibit information efficiency of financial markets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s relatively undisputed that the transaction taxes have a negative effect on the market as a whole, so the main question is: Is the effect on the market worth the small revenue increase?  </p>\n\n<p>My personal opinions are that no, there are better ways to raise that revenue without disrupting the financial markets.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lzt88b/financial_securities_transaction_taxes/","title":"Financial Securities Transaction Taxes","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-07T19:26:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-07 19:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lzt88b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lzt88b/financial_securities_transaction_taxes/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lzt88b/financial_securities_transaction_taxes/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"emc87","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/emc87","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"emc87","score":130,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"金融证券交易税","the_new_excerpt":"本届政府正在讨论对金融征税的几个建议。\n的交易。大多数都是在股票和债券征收0.1%的税和\n对衍生品征收较少的税。该税种的估计收入根据以下因素而变化：\n你问谁，介于几千亿到... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"金融證券交易稅","the_new_excerpt":"本屆政府正在討論對金融徵稅的幾個建議。\n的交易。大多數都是在股票和債券徵收0.1%的稅和\n對衍生品徵收較少的稅。該稅種的估計收入根據以下因素而變化：\n你問誰，介於幾千億到... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1372639256225705992","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1372639256225705992","title":"The markets are closed. \n \n✦ S&amp;P 500 ▼ 1.48%                  \n✦ Nasdaq ▼ 3.02%                  \n✦ Russell 2K ▼ 2.95%                  \n✦ Dow Jones ▼ 0.46% https://t.co/J5k7rVkb00","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"市场已经关闭。\n \nS&amp;P 500 ▼ 1.48%                  \n納斯達克 ▼ 3.02% ．                 \n罗素 2K ▼ 2.95%。                 \n道琼斯 ▼ 0.46% https://t.co/J5k7rVkb00","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"市場已經關閉。\n \nS&amp;P 500 ▼ 1.48%                  \n納斯達克 ▼ 3.02% ．                 \n羅素 2K ▼ 2.95%。                 \n道瓊斯 ▼ 0.46% https://t.co/J5k7rVkb00","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m7i1yk","excerpt":"Picture book DD since 🦍🦍🦍 no like read\n\n20 MM USD was spent on the 800C 3/19 so far this week\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aso8z03pepn61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8314dd277b4ada03e5484caa8da4271cdf4bd8e\n\nWhich resulted in very minimum delta hedging by the MMs, next week The Calls OI\nwill…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7i1yk/why_gme_only_moved_079_on_stimmy_wednesday/","title":"Why $GME only moved +0.79% on stimmy Wednesday","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 18, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么$GME在周三的刺激下只走了+0.79%？","the_new_excerpt":"绘本DD自🦍🦍🦍没有喜欢的读物。\n\n本周至今在800C 3/19上花费了20MM美元。\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aso8z03pepn61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8314dd277b4ada03e5484caa8da4271cdf4bd8e\n\n这导致MM们的delta对冲非常少，下周The Calls OI\n将...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼$GME在週三的刺激下只走了+0.79%？","the_new_excerpt":"繪本DD自🦍🦍🦍沒有喜歡的讀物。\n\n本週至今在800C 3/19上花費了20MM美元。\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aso8z03pepn61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8314dd277b4ada03e5484caa8da4271cdf4bd8e\n\n這導致MM們的delta對沖非常少，下週The Calls OI\n將...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lzt88b","previousId":"TweetPost-1372639256225705992","nextId":"RedditPost-m7i1yk","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lzt88b/financial_securities_transaction_taxes/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
