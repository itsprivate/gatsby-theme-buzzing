From 22M in September to 36M in February. More visitors to their webpage tells me that more people are interested in their products.</li>\n<li>They are looking to hire more people than their competitors. Nvidia has currently around 1000 open positions, compared to 700 for AMD and 650 for Intel. This tells me that the company is growing. But it’s also interesting to see what kind of people they are hiring. I like that they are looking to hire people for their Autonomous Vehicles Platform - huge future opportunity.</li>\n<li>Highest employee rating in the industry. People like working for Nvidia (if we should trust sites like Glassdoor and Indeed), more so than their competitors. The CEO approval is at an all time high and I believe that this will help them attract even more great people in the future.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>On top of this, financials looks rock solid with increasing revenue year over year.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://dillibits.com/index.php?t=NVDA\">https://dillibits.com/index.php?t=NVDA</a></p>\n\n<p>Your thoughts?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m75qs5/long_on_nvidia_alternative_data_points/","title":"Long on Nvidia - Alternative data points","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-18T15:58:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-18 15:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m75qs5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m75qs5/long_on_nvidia_alternative_data_points/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m75qs5/long_on_nvidia_alternative_data_points/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"robertrydefalk","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/robertrydefalk","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"robertrydefalk","score":47,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"长于Nvidia - 替代数据点","the_new_excerpt":"Nvidia今天的价格可能有点贵，但从未来和他们的。\n竞争对手，我还是看多英伟达，这是为什么。\n\n 1. 在过去的6个月里，他们的网页流量几乎翻了一番。从22M在\n    9月到2月的36M。更多的访问者告诉我，他们的网页\n    更多...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"長於Nvidia - 替代數據點","the_new_excerpt":"Nvidia今天的價格可能有點貴，但從未來和他們的。\n競爭對手，我還是看多英偉達，這是爲什麼。\n\n 1. 在過去的6個月裏，他們的網頁流量幾乎翻了一番。從22M在\n    9月到2月的36M。更多的訪問者告訴我，他們的網頁\n    更多...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m7kybq","excerpt":"A small write-up on a good swing play for Disney!\n\nI previously written up on bullish semiconductor stocks, bullish PLUG, and\nbearish CLOV and have been for the most part correct on those (anyone who\nfollowed those plays should have made tendies :] ).\n\nFor Disney $DIS I see it hitting 200 and maybe…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m7kybq/the_walt_disney_company_a_multisector_play_dis/","title":"The Walt Disney Company, a multi-sector play $DIS","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"华特-迪士尼公司，多板块玩法$DIS。","the_new_excerpt":"小编给大家写一篇迪士尼的波段好戏!\n\n我之前写过看好半导体股，看好PLUG，以及。\n看跌CLOV，并且在大多数情况下对这些都是正确的（任何人都会有这样的想法）。\n遵循这些剧目应该已经做了tendies:] 。).\n\n对于迪斯尼$DIS，我看到它打200，也许... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"華特-迪士尼公司，多板塊玩法$DIS。","the_new_excerpt":"小編給大家寫一篇迪士尼的波段好戲!\n\n我之前寫過看好半導體股，看好PLUG，以及。\n看跌CLOV，並且在大多數情況下對這些都是正確的（任何人都會有這樣的想法）。\n遵循這些劇目應該已經做了tendies:] 。).\n\n對於迪斯尼$DIS，我看到它打200，也許... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m7pbar","excerpt":"$AZN There's a press conference live now in Norway, where the vaccine is\ndirectly connected to the the blood clots in multiple patients.\n\nThe results have been sent to the EMA for further study.
