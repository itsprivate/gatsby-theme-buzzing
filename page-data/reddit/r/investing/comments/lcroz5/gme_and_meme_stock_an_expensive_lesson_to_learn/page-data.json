I&#39;m a university student who got laid off due to the pandemic and have yet to find a job since. When meme stocks blew up (BB, AMC, NOK, and GME or BANG) I jumped on the bandwagon thinking it&#39;s a fast way to make gains overnight instead of waiting for a company to grow organically. I spent 80% of what I have to my name and bought out shares of BANG, unfortunately, I have now lost 75% of my initial investment. Really expensive lesson but now I&#39;ve learned and will grow from this and come back stronger. Luckily, I made a deal with my mom when I started university so I don&#39;t have any bills to pay other than phone bill, gym membership, netflix, spotify etc. Just the basic stuff so I can still live off of what I left myself with for at least a few months. I&#39;m also in the last semester for a Computer Information System degree so I&#39;m hoping that I can get a job and get back what I lost. I will be holding my meme stocks until I die as a reminder of my very expensive mistake. If they go up great, if not it&#39;s no big deal as I have come to finally accept that I lost. Just something I wanna get out of my chest to be at peace with myself.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lcroz5/gme_and_meme_stock_an_expensive_lesson_to_learn/","title":"GME and meme stock an expensive lesson to learn.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T00:46:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 00:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lcroz5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcroz5/gme_and_meme_stock_an_expensive_lesson_to_learn/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcroz5/gme_and_meme_stock_an_expensive_lesson_to_learn/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"kazamasta31","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/kazamasta31","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"kazamasta31","score":915,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME和meme股票昂贵的教训。","the_new_excerpt":"我去年开始交易股票，当电晕发生时，就像其他人一样。\n了。我是一名大学生，因为流行病而下岗，还没有。\n来找工作，因为。当meme股票炸了（BB，AMC，NOK，和GME或BANG），我\n跳上了这个行列，认为这是一个快速的方式，使... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME和meme股票昂貴的教訓。","the_new_excerpt":"我去年開始交易股票，當電暈發生時，就像其他人一樣。\n了。我是一名大學生，因爲流行病而下崗，還沒有。\n來找工作，因爲。當meme股票炸了（BB，AMC，NOK，和GME或BANG），我\n跳上了這個行列，認爲這是一個快速的方式，使... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26114701","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26114701","title":"New model could explain old cholesterol mystery","date":"February 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"新模型可以解释古老的胆固醇之谜","locale":"zh"},{"title":"新模型可以解釋古老的膽固醇之謎","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lir5qk","excerpt":"I get it, y’all hating on GME flooding the sub these days, but why remove the\ndaily thread?
