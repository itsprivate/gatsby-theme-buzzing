(<a href=\"https://archive.fo/sELHo\">Archive link</a>). (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE\">Video interview</a>). The video covers a lot more than the article so I highly recommend watching that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“That has quieted down and we are in negotiations,” she said. “We wanted to be fair and square with our partner, and I think things will work out.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She&#39;s expecting strong return on her funds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wood said she’s confident her investments will return <strong>at least 20% annually</strong>, more than <strong>doubling</strong> over the next five years. As one of the few female CEOs in finance, Wood prizes her performance. She also points to it as advice for other women in her field.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Her biggest bet in the future is probably going to be in genomics (ARKG):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tesla’s still in the running, but I would have to say the biggest upside surprises are going to come from the genomic space</p>\n\n<p>The next FANNGs are going to be from genomics (from the video)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know Resolute is painted as the bad guys here, but according to this article, they were the first big backers to invest in Ark, to give Cathie a chance:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We were quite the loss-making company, and I felt it acutely since I funded most of it for the first three years,” Wood said. “We built it. They did not come.” With no background in ETFs and only $40 million of assets after 2 1/2 years, Wood needed a partner to distribute Ark’s products. That’s how Resolute entered the picture. In 2016, it acquired a minority stake, including an option to buy control.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ark is much bigger and more profitable than it appears.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We’re up to $50 billion,” Wood, Ark’s chief executive officer, said in a Bloomberg “Front Row” interview. “Our business is very profitable.” In addition to the $30.5 billion of assets in its seven ETFs, Ark <strong>manages accounts for retail and institutional clients</strong> as well as funds in non-U.S. markets. Its ETF revenue alone adds up to at least $225 million a year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t know Ark handles accounts for institutional clients. Does that represent any conflicts of interest (I assume not this is probably very common right?)</p>\n\n<p>Just wanted to share the news since I know many here were worried about this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kfufwc/cathie_wood_sees_control_fight_ending_lifting/","title":"Cathie Wood sees control fight ENDING, lifting cloud over Ark","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 19, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-19T00:47:46.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-19 00:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kfufwc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kfufwc/cathie_wood_sees_control_fight_ending_lifting/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kfufwc/cathie_wood_sees_control_fight_ending_lifting/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"r2002","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/r2002","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"r2002","score":844,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"凯西·伍德看到控制权之争结束，方舟上空的阴云散去","the_new_excerpt":"彭博社\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/cathie-wood-sees-control-fight-ending-lifting-cloud-over-ark].\n(档案链接[https://archive.fo/sELHo]).(视频采访\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE]).这段视频涵盖的内容远远不止\n所以我强烈推荐…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"凱西·伍德看到控制權之爭結束，方舟上空的陰雲散去","the_new_excerpt":"彭博社\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/cathie-wood-sees-control-fight-ending-lifting-cloud-over-ark].\n(檔案鏈接[https://archive.fo/sELHo]).(視頻採訪\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE]).這段視頻涵蓋的內容遠遠不止\n所以我強烈推薦…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kfltn1","excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/citadel-trading-chief-says-tesla-is-risk-to-other-s-p-500-stocks?srnd=premium\n\n> Funds that mimic the benchmark are set to buy more than $70 billion of the\n> carmaker’s shares and dump an equal amount of stock in existing members,\n> producing…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kfltn1/citadel_trading_chief_says_tesla_is_risk_to_other/","title":"Citadel Trading Chief Says Tesla Is Risk to Other S&P 500 Stocks","date":"December 19, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Citadel交易首席执行官表示，特斯拉对其他标准普尔500指数成份股构成风险","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/citadel-trading-chief-says-tesla-is-risk-to-other-s-p-500-stocks?srnd=premium\n\n>模仿基准的基金将购买超过700亿美元的\n>汽车制造商的股票，并在现有成员中抛售同等数量的股票，\n>生产…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Citadel交易首席執行官表示，特斯拉對其他標準普爾500指數成份股構成風險","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/citadel-trading-chief-says-tesla-is-risk-to-other-s-p-500-stocks?srnd=premium\n\n>模仿基準的基金將購買超過700億美元的\n>汽車製造商的股票，並在現有成員中拋售同等數量的股票，\n>生產…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1340076787892510720","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1340076787892510720","title":"RT @EricBalchunas: NEXT LEVEL: $TSLA just obliterated the all-time volume record for an equity w/ $148b worth of shares traded today, beati…","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"December 19, 2020","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"rt@ericbalchunas：下一个级别：Beati sla刚刚抹去了今天交易的价值1480亿美元的股票的历史成交量纪录，美国电话…","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"下一级：美国电话SLA刚刚抹去了今天成交额为1480亿美元的股票的历史成交量纪录，超过了斯普林特PY在3月份混乱期间创下的1180亿美元的最高纪录。相比之下，微软的日交易额约为50亿美元。https://t.co/0PuVrrrjju"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"rt@ericbalchunas：下一個級別：Beati sla剛剛抹去了今天交易的價值1480億美元的股票的歷史成交量紀錄，美國電話…","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"下一級：美國電話SLA剛剛抹去了今天成交額爲1480億美元的股票的歷史成交量紀錄，超過了斯普林特PY在3月份混亂期間創下的1180億美元的最高紀錄。相比之下，微軟的日交易額約爲50億美元。https://t.co/0PuVrrrjju"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kfufwc","previousId":"RedditPost-kfltn1","nextId":"TweetPost-1340076787892510720","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kfufwc/cathie_wood_sees_control_fight_ending_lifting/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","386998304","4203388852"]}
