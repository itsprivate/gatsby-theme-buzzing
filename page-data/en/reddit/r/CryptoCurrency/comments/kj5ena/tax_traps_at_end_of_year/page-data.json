We worked at Sun.  He had ESOP shares  that he sold when he thought the market was peaked , late in the year.  Early the next year,  Sun dipped,  he took the entirety of his &#39;winnings&#39; and put it all back into Sun.  Then the bubble burst,  Sun stock plummeted,  but he  owed  tax on the prior years enormous profit.  He waited and waited as the April 15th deadline approached,  hoping  Sun would recover,  it didn&#39;t,  it  actually got noticeably worse as tax day approached.  My friend had to sell very low, to pay  his tax bill,  and was still $ 200K short!.    It took him many years  to recover.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kj5ena/tax_traps_at_end_of_year/","title":"Tax traps at end of year","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"December 24, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-24T11:30:22.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-24 11:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kj5ena","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kj5ena/tax_traps_at_end_of_year/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kj5ena/tax_traps_at_end_of_year/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"theFoot58","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/theFoot58","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"theFoot58","score":67,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"年底的税收陷阱","the_new_excerpt":"作为一个目睹了几个亲密朋友在年底被屠杀的人\n泡沫上网期间税收陷阱爆了，听我说完。\n\n如果你在年底前做出任何戏剧性的举动，并锁定任何\n利润，看在上帝的份上，请当场计算一下税负，\n和…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"年底的稅收陷阱","the_new_excerpt":"作爲一個目睹了幾個親密朋友在年底被屠殺的人\n泡沫上網期間稅收陷阱爆了，聽我說完。\n\n如果你在年底前做出任何戲劇性的舉動，並鎖定任何\n利潤，看在上帝的份上，請當場計算一下稅負，\n和…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1342028325238284288","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1342028325238284288","title":"🎄Merry Christmas Everyone! https://t.co/fW1o9IC6hn","date":"December 24, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"🎄大家圣诞快乐！https://t.co/fW1o9IC6hn","quoted_status_full_text":"我们庆祝#Beethoven250。想象一下，当我们所有人都可以在一起，再次完整地分享他的音乐时的感觉。https://t.co/y3Sw6d3dRb","retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"🎄大家聖誕快樂！https://t.co/fW1o9IC6hn","quoted_status_full_text":"我們慶祝#Beethoven250。想象一下，當我們所有人都可以在一起，再次完整地分享他的音樂時的感覺。https://t.co/y3Sw6d3dRb","retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kjcjjs","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kjcjjs/moneygram_distances_itself_from_ripple_says_it/","title":"MoneyGram distances itself from Ripple, says it doesn't utilize RippleNet","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"December 24, 2020","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"速汇金与Ripple保持距离，称不使用RippleNet","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"速匯金與Ripple保持距離，稱不使用RippleNet","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kj5ena","previousId":"TweetPost-1342028325238284288","nextId":"RedditPost-kjcjjs","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kj5ena/tax_traps_at_end_of_year/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","386998304","4203388852"]}
