He prefers real estate investments. </p>\n\n<p>But one of the Christmas discussions suddenly made him understand crypto. I explained it as a way to stay liquid, independent from banks similar to what gold did for people after a war. Just that in this case, the scenario is not a war, but a financial crash such as in Greece, Argentinia, Venezuela, etc. where people suddenly discovered, that they either can&#39;t access their savings or that they were worthless. </p>\n\n<p>A week later he told me his investment software offers &quot;bitcoin&quot;. A closer look showed there was no way to withdraw it which made him say &quot;oh, so this is not real bitcoin then&quot;.
