I believe restricting the amount of comments a user can have eligible for moons (18 a day / 504 a month) will hopefully inspire more effort to be made when commenting.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s likely this small tweak will only apply to a tiny proportion of the community, however I believe it will make moon distribution fairer and more accessible for people that only comment insightful points.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m interested to hear what you think about this proposal, is the threshold too high? too low? When you vote perhaps comment a reason.</p>\n\n<p>Please note, after you hit the 504 comments (including deleted ones) per month threshold you will still be able to comment, but the subsequent karma will not be counted for the moon distribution. 504 was chosen as it&#39;s 18 comments per day in the 28 day moon cycle.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/kj2b8k\">View Poll</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kj2b8k/moon_proposal_restriction_on_the_amount_of/","title":"MOON Proposal: Restriction on the amount of comments per user eligible for Moon distribution.","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"December 24, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-24T20:41:08.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-24 20:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kj2b8k","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kj2b8k/moon_proposal_restriction_on_the_amount_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kj2b8k/moon_proposal_restriction_on_the_amount_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"mhucpr","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mhucpr","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"mhucpr","score":87,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"MOUNE建议：对每个符合MOUNE分发条件的用户的评论数量进行限制。","the_new_excerpt":"这项建议的理念是鼓励更多经过深思熟虑的意见，并\n不鼓励用户简单地针对评论点进行评论，以便进行农业\n月亮。\n\n我注意到有几个用户在没有应用任何评论的情况下发送垃圾评论\n努力/讨论。我认为限制…的评论数量","locale":"zh"},{"title":"MOUNE建議：對每個符合MOUNE分發條件的用戶的評論數量進行限制。","the_new_excerpt":"這項建議的理念是鼓勵更多經過深思熟慮的意見，並\n不鼓勵用戶簡單地針對評論點進行評論，以便進行農業\n月亮。\n\n我注意到有幾個用戶在沒有應用任何評論的情況下發送垃圾評論\n努力/討論。我認爲限制…的評論數量","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kjim5f","excerpt":"Is this unhealthy?
