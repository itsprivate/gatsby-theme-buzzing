My understanding is that with bitcoin it take 10-15 minutes to verify a transaction, and that transaction fees can be around $1 or more or less depending on network demand. So if a coffee shop started accepting bitcoin and I went and bought a cup of coffee, how would it work? Would I buy a $3 coffee and then have to pay $1 transaction fee plus wait for 10-15 minutes so the coffee shop could verify the transaction? If that is the case then can we conclude that bitcoin will never be appropriate for small scale transactions of this type? Or am I missing something?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/knr2yv/dont_transaction_fees_and_confirmation_time/","title":"Don't transaction fees and confirmation time basically mean we will never be able to use bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee?","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"December 31, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-31T21:30:17.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-31 21:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"knr2yv","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/knr2yv/dont_transaction_fees_and_confirmation_time/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/knr2yv/dont_transaction_fees_and_confirmation_time/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"Chap_stick_original","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chap_stick_original","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Chap_stick_original","score":323,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"交易手续费和确认时间基本上不是意味着我们永远不能用比特币买一杯咖啡吗？","the_new_excerpt":"在这方面，用密码购买一杯咖啡的概念有点像是一种比喻。\n我要说的是，请原谅我，并帮助回答这个问题。我的理解是\n使用比特币需要10-15分钟来验证交易，而且\n根据…的不同，交易费可能在1美元左右或更高或更低","locale":"zh"},{"title":"交易手續費和確認時間基本上不是意味着我們永遠不能用比特幣買一杯咖啡嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"在這方面，用密碼購買一杯咖啡的概念有點像是一種比喻。\n我要說的是，請原諒我，並幫助回答這個問題。我的理解是\n使用比特幣需要10-15分鐘來驗證交易，而且\n根據…的不同，交易費可能在1美元左右或更高或更低","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-knncb1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/knncb1/the_us_has_already_lost_the_2020_crypto/","title":"The US has already lost the 2020 crypto regulation race to Europe","date":"December 31, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"美国已经在2020年的密码法规竞赛中输给了欧洲","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國已經在2020年的密碼法規競賽中輸給了歐洲","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kntcwh","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kntcwh/bon_appetite_john_mcafee/","title":"Bon appetite John McAfee","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"December 31, 2020","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"好胃口约翰·麦卡菲","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"好胃口約翰·麥卡菲","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-knr2yv","previousId":"RedditPost-knncb1","nextId":"RedditPost-kntcwh","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/knr2yv/dont_transaction_fees_and_confirmation_time/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","386998304","4203388852"]}
