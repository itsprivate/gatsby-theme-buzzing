Cancel it. Facebook? Delete it. Twitter? Get rid of it. Instagram? Stop it. Reddit? Skip it.\nApart from the negative influence a lot of these media have, it&#39;s often a horrible waste of time.\nAmericans spend on average <a href=\"https://www.mandatory.com/living/1478185-social-media-wasting-time\">1471 hours</a> a year watching tv.\nMalcolm Gladwell stated that it takes 10.000 hours or practice to become an expert at something. Didn&#39;t read the book, but I gave my own twist to it: I combine it with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\">pareto principle</a> and I come to the conlusion that it takes only 80 hours to get 50% of the expert level. So yeah, let&#39;s be conservative and let&#39;s say it takes 100 hours to be decent at something.\nThen, go ahead, get decent at something instead of watching television. Learn to code. Learn a new language. Study nutrition. Try to master an instrument. Make your own furniture. <em>This is investing in yourself.</em>\nWaste less time on politics as well. The chance you will change something is very small anyway. Clean your own room first.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the thing you picked up at #1 is not a physical activity, pick up one. Go lift, run, go play squash. It&#39;s healthy for both body and mind. Chop trees. Fix your garden. Not only does this make your body release nice hormones and improve your physique, it also decreases the chance of getting Alzheimer&#39;s later in life.* This is investing in yourself.*</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Waste less money.</strong> Boosting your savings rate with <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/\">15% means you can stop working 8(!) years earlier</a>. So again, cancel that Netflix membership and skip that McDonalds meal for a nice homecooked one. This is investing in yourself.</p></li>\n<li><p>Allocate some money to &#39;high-risk&#39; investments. Buy Bitcoin, smart people do. Buy <a href=\"https://warosu.org/biz/thread/S25039356\">Coinbase before the IPO</a>. We are in a bullmarket and the FED is printing like crazy. Cash is trash.\nYou are scared of a loss? The dollar lost 10% ytd versus the euro.... and versus bitcoin? More than 70% loss.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make someone&#39;s day more often. Call your mother.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><sup>*Don&#39;t</sup> <sup>waste</sup> <sup>time</sup> <sup>debunking</sup> <sup>Malcolm</sup> <sup>Gladwell,</sup> <sup>I</sup> <sup>don&#39;t</sup> <sup>care.</sup> <sup>The</sup> <sup>point</sup> <sup>is:</sup> <sup>you</sup> <sup>can</sup> <sup>allocate</sup> <sup>your</sup> <sup>time</sup> <sup>to</sup> <sup>more</sup> <sup>useful</sup> <sup>things</sup> <sup>than</sup> <sup>mindless</sup> <sup>entertainment.</sup></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ko7kpa/how_to_make_2021_your_best_year/","title":"How to make 2021 your best year","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"January 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-01T19:55:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-01 19:55","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ko7kpa","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ko7kpa/how_to_make_2021_your_best_year/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ko7kpa/how_to_make_2021_your_best_year/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/U6f31KQFlmo6n2g366VbE1urSaLplisit0DqI6AeqEU.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=73f3f85d70fb5032431b7bee9523139bbc31cd0c","video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"toplelkekfag","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/toplelkekfag","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"toplelkekfag","score":151,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如何让2021年成为你最好的一年","the_new_excerpt":"下面是让2021年成为你最好的一年的5个决心。\n\n1.少浪费时间。有Netflix吗？取消它。脸书？把它删掉。推特？到达\n把它扔掉。Instagram?别说了。雷迪特？跳过它。除了消极的一面\n这些媒体有很多影响力，这往往是可怕的浪费时间。\n美国人…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何讓2021年成爲你最好的一年","the_new_excerpt":"下面是讓2021年成爲你最好的一年的5個決心。\n\n1.少浪費時間。有Netflix嗎？取消它。臉書？把它刪掉。推特？到達\n把它扔掉。Instagram?別說了。雷迪特？跳過它。除了消極的一面\n這些媒體有很多影響力，這往往是可怕的浪費時間。\n美國人…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ko46c7","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ko46c7/a_lot_of_people_laughed_at_plans_stock_to_flow/","title":"A lot of people laughed at Plan's Stock to Flow model earlier this year (some even tried to dox him).
