Most if not all of the members of these groups have been tricked into thinking that they have all the answers to the worlds problems and anyone who dares challenge them is some sort of &quot;ist&quot; or a sheep.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: This post dost not make any statement about the merit of the beliefs held by each of the groups I mentioned, nor does it intend to.
