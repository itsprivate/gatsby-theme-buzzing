Thankfully there is some protection on the books for them already.</p>\n\n<p>I believe gun manufacturers should not be held liable in any way if someone uses one of the products in a crime. So if someone buy X gun that is made from Y manufacturer and they kill 10 people with that gun, Y manufacturer in no way should be held liable for that persons actions. </p>\n\n<p>The distributor who sold got it to a gun shop and the FFL who sold it to the person after the proper process should also not be held accountable at all. </p>\n\n<p>Gun manufacturers should be held accountable if they make a low quality product that causes harm to the user or they blatantly lie about features or abilities of their product (just like any other manufacturer of other goods). </p>\n\n<p>I also don’t believe someone like Audi, Nissan or Jeep should be sued if someone drives drunk and kills 3 people. Or even if the purposely kill someone with their vehicle. Busch or Heineken shouldn’t be held liable if someone commits a crime under the influence of one of their beverages.</p>\n\n<p>So CMV, why should gun companies be able to be sued for someone suing their product illegally?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lmai04/cmv_gun_manufacturers_should_not_be_able_to_be/","title":"CMV: Gun manufacturers should not be able to be sued if someone uses their product in a crime.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-18T17:13:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-18 17:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"67e79abf-465d-5152-a50c-88a82b141ece","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lmai04/cmv_gun_manufacturers_should_not_be_able_to_be/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lmai04/cmv_gun_manufacturers_should_not_be_able_to_be/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"-Lemon-Lime-Lemon-","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/-Lemon-Lime-Lemon-","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"-Lemon-Lime-Lemon-","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：如果有人在犯罪中使用其产品，枪支制造商不应该被起诉。","the_new_excerpt":"所以有人会欢迎起诉枪支制造商和经销商的想法\n为简单的正常操作程序。值得庆幸的是，在\n账目已经为他们。\n\n我相信枪支制造商不应该以任何方式追究责任，如果有人使用了\n案中案产品之一....","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：如果有人在犯罪中使用其產品，槍支製造商不應該被起訴。","the_new_excerpt":"所以有人會歡迎起訴槍支製造商和經銷商的想法\n爲簡單的正常操作程序。值得慶幸的是，在\n賬目已經爲他們。\n\n我相信槍支製造商不應該以任何方式追究責任，如果有人使用了\n案中案產品之一....","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-5ff01283-3c7a-51fa-bb4b-87a3a6ac0c89","excerpt":"They only Identify as a woman/Man/NB.
