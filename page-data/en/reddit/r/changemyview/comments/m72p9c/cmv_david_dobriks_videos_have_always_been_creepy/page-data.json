It was always weird to me, there was always that implied pressure to say yes because you are on camera and it made me slightly uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<p>Looking back, it&#39;s even worse. Asking people to do dangerous or impactful things &quot;for the vlog&quot; or by toting life changing amounts of money in front of them is incredibly manipulative. Looking back at all the times one of them hooked up with people after asking for consent on camera, I&#39;d be heavily surprised if the current rape allegation ends up being the only one.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>And don&#39;t even get me started on his apology, all he did was essentially shift the blame and say &quot;Yeah those people who used to be in my vlogs were creepy so I don&#39;t hang out with them anymore&quot; even though <strong>he was the one who constructed those situations, participated in them encouragingly, filmed them, and then uploaded and profited massively.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>My claim is this: Even without the new information and allegations from recent times, people should&#39;ve noticed how manipulative David was and that there was some seriously creepy stuff going on in his vlogs. He should not have gone this long without being held accountable.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m72p9c/cmv_david_dobriks_videos_have_always_been_creepy/","title":"CMV: David Dobrik's videos have always been creepy and he should've been held accountable years ago","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T22:37:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 22:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"95b5ae46-c0c2-5471-a86b-31094b7b1e54","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m72p9c/cmv_david_dobriks_videos_have_always_been_creepy/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m72p9c/cmv_david_dobriks_videos_have_always_been_creepy/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Comrade_Vive","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Comrade_Vive","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Comrade_Vive","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：David Dobrik的视频一直都很诡异，多年前就应该追究他的责任。","the_new_excerpt":"几年前，我还是个傻孩子，看大卫的视频，我就知道有什么东西在里面。\n关。这对我来说很奇怪，总是有一种隐含的压力，说。\n是的，因为你在镜头前，这让我有点不舒服。\n\n回想起来，这更糟糕。要求人们做危险的事或...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：David Dobrik的視頻一直都很詭異，多年前就應該追究他的責任。","the_new_excerpt":"幾年前，我還是個傻孩子，看大衛的視頻，我就知道有什麼東西在裏面。\n關。這對我來說很奇怪，總是有一種隱含的壓力，說。\n是的，因爲你在鏡頭前，這讓我有點不舒服。\n\n回想起來，這更糟糕。要求人們做危險的事或...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-98e4a7ce-96be-5c09-bb6a-5fccc44498d8","excerpt":"From a support standpoint, yes I think should believe all women\n\nBut when it comes to consequences, legal or otherwise such as being fired from a\njob or removed from a position, there should always be due process and an\ninvestigation prior to judgement being passed, yes even if “you know he did…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m77fwf/cmv_for_any_rapesexual_assault_allegations_there/","title":"CMV: For any rape/sexual assault allegations there should always be due process and we should not “believe all women”","date":"March 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：对于任何强奸/性侵犯指控，都应该有适当的程序，我们不应该 \"相信所有妇女\"","the_new_excerpt":"从支持的角度来看，是的，我认为应该相信所有的女性。\n\n但是，当涉及到法律或其他方面的后果时，比如被开除。\n工作或被免职，总是应该有适当的程序和一个\n是的，即使 \"你知道他做了......\"，也要在判决前进行调查。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：對於任何強姦/性侵犯指控，都應該有適當的程序，我們不應該 \"相信所有婦女\"","the_new_excerpt":"從支持的角度來看，是的，我認爲應該相信所有的女性。\n\n但是，當涉及到法律或其他方面的後果時，比如被開除。\n工作或被免職，總是應該有適當的程序和一個\n是的，即使 \"你知道他做了......\"，也要在判決前進行調查。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-9d770d47-8cde-55c6-8d2f-a54a0bc59f47","excerpt":"While I realize by some definitions of vegan this is impossible.
