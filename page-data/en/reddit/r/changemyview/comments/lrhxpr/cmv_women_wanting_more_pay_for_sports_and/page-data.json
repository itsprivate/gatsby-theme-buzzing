Female sports in general do not have as much interest, for a variety of reasons we can discuss further if someone would like, but the end result is lower ad revenue/ticket sales/merch sales/etc. This creates overall less revenue which results in lower profits to be shared with players.</p>\n\n<p>Trans-women want to be perceived to be as physically attractive as other cis-women by cis-males.  Cis-males are primarily only interested in cis-women. There are numerous reasons for this, but the main takeaway is that there is simply not a lot of demand among the cis-male crowd for trans-women.</p>\n\n<p>Both of these campaigns are not about equality. They are about trying to generate a higher demand for what they are offering. If the demand was already there then there wouldn&#39;t be an issue. That to me isn&#39;t an equality issue. People not wanting what you are offering is a problem with your product, not the consumer. Maybe using marketplace terminology is too cold, but that is how my brain works.</p>\n\n<p>If I prefer to watch male sports I&#39;m not a sexist. If I prefer to date a cis-female I&#39;m not trans-phobic. Quit trying to demonize me for not having an interest in you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lrhxpr/cmv_women_wanting_more_pay_for_sports_and/","title":"CMV: Women wanting more pay for sports and trans-women wanting to be found attractive by cis-men is a demand problem not an equality problem.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-24T18:36:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-24 18:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"d057933b-6829-547f-80fc-471baf4ec102","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lrhxpr/cmv_women_wanting_more_pay_for_sports_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lrhxpr/cmv_women_wanting_more_pay_for_sports_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Ridikyo0l","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ridikyo0l","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Ridikyo0l","score":283,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：女性希望在运动中获得更多的报酬，而跨性别女性希望被同性男性发现有吸引力，这是一个需求问题，而不是平等问题。","the_new_excerpt":"我不愿意发表这个观点......如果我说的不对，希望有人可以\n解释一下，我在评论中可以理解的方式。\n\n女运动员想要更高的报酬。女运动员一般没有那么多\n兴趣，由于各种原因，我们可以进一步讨论，如果有人愿意... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：女性希望在運動中獲得更多的報酬，而跨性別女性希望被同性男性發現有吸引力，這是一個需求問題，而不是平等問題。","the_new_excerpt":"我不願意發表這個觀點......如果我說的不對，希望有人可以\n解釋一下，我在評論中可以理解的方式。\n\n女運動員想要更高的報酬。女運動員一般沒有那麼多\n興趣，由於各種原因，我們可以進一步討論，如果有人願意... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-9c36ac23-cfc0-5059-aa1a-b893c56f21b2","excerpt":"growing up ginger hasn't been fun at all, from primary school to university and\ngoing outside I've been bullied because of my ginger hair, from name calling and\nbeing teated differently to even being beaten up all because my hair. my problem\nis that bullying someone due to their natural hair being…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lqp11z/cmv_bullying_some_because_they_are_naturally/","title":"CMV: bullying some because they are naturally ginger is the same as bullying a black person because they are black","date":"February 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：因为天生姜还是老的辣而欺负一些人，就等于因为是黑人而欺负黑人。","the_new_excerpt":"姜的成长一点也不好玩，从小学到大学，再到\n我因为我的姜黄色头发被人欺负过，从骂人到现在\n我的问题是，我的问题是，我的问题是，我的问题是，我的问题是，我的问题是，我的问题是，我的问题是，我的问题是\n是欺负别人，因为他们的自然头发是... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：因爲天生薑還是老的辣而欺負一些人，就等於因爲是黑人而欺負黑人。","the_new_excerpt":"姜的成長一點也不好玩，從小學到大學，再到\n我因爲我的薑黃色頭髮被人欺負過，從罵人到現在\n我的問題是，我的問題是，我的問題是，我的問題是，我的問題是，我的問題是，我的問題是，我的問題是，我的問題是\n是欺負別人，因爲他們的自然頭髮是... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-7e1860f3-a0f2-5f4a-8675-598422fb6b26","excerpt":"Despite pointed warnings in editorials\n[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-01-16/donald-trump-insurrection-capitol-beer-hall-putsch]\nabout how much worse a more determined, organized attack could have been, we\nhave seen little in the way of repercussions for anyone in higher positions…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lrj882/cmv_the_attack_on_the_capitol_isnt_being_taken/","title":"CMV: The attack on the Capitol isn't being taken seriously enough, and that will embolden and encourage some kind of repeat attempt","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 24, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：对国会大厦的攻击并没有得到足够的重视，这将会让人更加胆大妄为，并鼓励某种重复的企图","the_new_excerpt":"尽管社论中提出了尖锐的警告\n[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-01-16/donald-trump-insurrection-capitol-beer-hall-putsch]\n关于一个更坚定的、有组织的攻击可能会有多么糟糕，我们... ...\n担任高官的人都没有受到什么影响... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：對國會大廈的攻擊並沒有得到足夠的重視，這將會讓人更加膽大妄爲，並鼓勵某種重複的企圖","the_new_excerpt":"儘管社論中提出了尖銳的警告\n[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-01-16/donald-trump-insurrection-capitol-beer-hall-putsch]\n關於一個更堅定的、有組織的攻擊可能會有多麼糟糕，我們... ...\n擔任高官的人都沒有受到什麼影響... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-d057933b-6829-547f-80fc-471baf4ec102","previousId":"RedditPost-9c36ac23-cfc0-5059-aa1a-b893c56f21b2","nextId":"RedditPost-7e1860f3-a0f2-5f4a-8675-598422fb6b26","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lrhxpr/cmv_women_wanting_more_pay_for_sports_and/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
