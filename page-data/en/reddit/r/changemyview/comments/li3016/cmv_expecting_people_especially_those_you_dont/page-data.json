I don&#39;t care what your pronouns are and you shouldn&#39;t expect me to care. I have and probably always will refer to almost everybody with &quot;dude&quot; (which is widely seen as gender neutral) or &quot;y&#39;all&quot; (I&#39;m from the south), the only exception being when I refer to people by name, which is how I primarily address people. </p>\n\n<p>Your gender identity is exactly that: Yours. It is not any one else&#39;s and therefore, you should not EXPECT, keyword here: <em>EXPECT,</em> people (especially those you don&#39;t know) to address you by your pronouns all the time or get upset when they opt for neutral pronouns other than your preferred ones. </p>\n\n<p>I have, unexpectedly, been told off by someone for not addressing them with their proper pronouns, but NOT because I used the wrong ones after they told me theirs, but because I used neutral ones instead. </p>\n\n<p>Because of the attitudes of individuals in the LGBTQ+ community that I&#39;ve observed regarding this topic, I believe that if you think you are obligated to be referred to in your preferred pronoun and get upset when you aren&#39;t, you are entitled in thinking that you deserve special treatment. (purposeful mis-gendering excluded)</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: I understand that this is a jaded opinion from personal experiences. I may have my head so far up my own ass I can&#39;t even comprehend the light. That&#39;s the purpose of this sub, convince me otherwise. Don&#39;t bash me because I&#39;m an idiot, show me how not to be one if you think of me as such.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/li3016/cmv_expecting_people_especially_those_you_dont/","title":"CMV: Expecting people, especially those you don't know, to call you by your preferred pronouns is not only entitled, but unrealistic.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-12T07:36:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-12 07:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"5a34d226-1d36-532f-a831-e2f3075154dd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/li3016/cmv_expecting_people_especially_those_you_dont/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/li3016/cmv_expecting_people_especially_those_you_dont/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Arisal1122","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Arisal1122","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Arisal1122","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：期望别人，特别是那些你不认识的人，用你喜欢的代名词来称呼你，不仅是有权的，而且是不现实的。","the_new_excerpt":"让我先声明，我并不反对LGBTQ+的任何权利。\n形式或时尚，做你想做的事，如何做你想做的事，做你想做的人，我。\n不在乎。\n\n说到这里，我的论点的主干是： 我不在乎。我不在乎。\n你的代词是什么，你不应该期望... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：期望別人，特別是那些你不認識的人，用你喜歡的代名詞來稱呼你，不僅是有權的，而且是不現實的。","the_new_excerpt":"讓我先聲明，我並不反對LGBTQ+的任何權利。\n形式或時尚，做你想做的事，如何做你想做的事，做你想做的人，我。\n不在乎。\n\n說到這裏，我的論點的主幹是： 我不在乎。我不在乎。\n你的代詞是什麼，你不應該期望... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-b6469a2a-b540-57ac-8638-6ada33e1d544","excerpt":"Recently I’ve been seeing lots of friends of mine posting stories on social\nmedia about not being able to cook at all, not knowing how to clean their own\nclothes or even wash dishes.
