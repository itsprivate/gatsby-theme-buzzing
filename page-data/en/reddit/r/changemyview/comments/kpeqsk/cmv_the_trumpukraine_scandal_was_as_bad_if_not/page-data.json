In the Trump–Ukraine scandal, Trump withheld foreign aid to an American ally against American interests for his own political gain.  Both Nixon and Trump initially tried to deny any wrongdoing.  Nixon was soon coming under fire with evidence getting released and his removal from office seemed very likely.</p>\n\n<p>Nixon and Trump refused to cooperate with investigators and obstructed justice, both creating a constitutional crises.  Nixon was much smarter than Trump as Trump went on to admit his crime on national television while still claiming innocence.</p>\n\n<p>But here is where I see things diverge in today&#39;s polarized political climate.  There are massive amounts of alternative news sources today that peddle conspiracies undermining Trump&#39;s guilt.  Even a major television network Fox News would try to portray the scandal as illegitimate.  Many Republican politicians in Trump&#39;s era would fully back his innocence regardless of reality for political purposes.  Even Mitch McConnell said impeachment was a political event and he didn&#39;t care about having a just trial.</p>\n\n<p>In the end for Nixon, he saw the writing on the wall and resigned to get a pardon from Ford.  For Trump, the house drafted articles of impeachment only for the Republican held Senate to refuse to allow testimony or evidence to be presented and demanded a vote based on nothing.  They voted down party lines (with the exception of Mitt Romney) and since the Republicans held a majority, he was acquitted.</p>\n\n<p>To this day I keep running across people saying what Nixon did was the worst thing ever but what Trump did was no big deal because he was acquitted.  I think in a fair judicial system comparing the two, Trump&#39;s crimes were as bad or worse and most likely both would&#39;ve been removed from office.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
