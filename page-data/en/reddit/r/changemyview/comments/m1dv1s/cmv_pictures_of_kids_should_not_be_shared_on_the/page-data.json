Every teenager is embarrassed by their baby pictures.</p>\n\n<p>I know that parents have been taking pictures of their kids ever since cameras were invented. And of course, they collect those pictures in photo albums, and they might show them to a few close friends. But with the internet, those pictures reach a wider audience. And they may attract undesired attention.</p>\n\n<p>No matter what filters you put on pictures to decide who can or can&#39;t see them, there&#39;s always the risk of someone getting around it via hacking.
