On every application, I have had to fill out an equal opportunities form, stating my ethnic background, my gender and my sexuality etc. I am bisexual, and I can&#39;t help but feel like that may put me at an advantage. I see that these forms are used to ensure that a certain amount of people in each category for each question is accepted, or invited to interview. \nI think that this is counter-productive in providing equality. This is because it ensures <em>equality of outcome</em>. When really, we should be focusing on <em>equality of opportunity</em>. I think that equality forms should be banned, and these things should remain unknown, removing bias completely, and forcing the judgements to be made purely on skills, education and experience.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps this is a naïve point of view, and I&#39;m really looking to learn, so please help me out and post your opinions below.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lp90a6/cmv_equality_forms_when_applying_to_some_jobs/","title":"CMV: Equality forms when applying to some jobs should be banned","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-22T03:36:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-22 03:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"939f75d0-e503-553f-b995-b9af967abdd9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lp90a6/cmv_equality_forms_when_applying_to_some_jobs/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lp90a6/cmv_equality_forms_when_applying_to_some_jobs/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"_esorbma","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/_esorbma","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"_esorbma","score":285,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：应禁止在申请某些工作时使用平等表。","the_new_excerpt":"在过去的一年多时间里，我申请了多所大学和工作。在\n每份申请，我都要填写一份平等机会表格，说明以下内容\n我的种族背景，我的性别和我的性取向等等。我是个双性恋者，我不能。\n但感觉这可能会让我处于优势。我看到...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：應禁止在申請某些工作時使用平等表。","the_new_excerpt":"在過去的一年多時間裏，我申請了多所大學和工作。在\n每份申請，我都要填寫一份平等機會表格，說明以下內容\n我的種族背景，我的性別和我的性取向等等。我是個雙性戀者，我不能。\n但感覺這可能會讓我處於優勢。我看到...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-01cb0f05-39df-5776-9e20-0f6ed9b0270b","excerpt":"Ok first things first.\n\nI'm black , let me say that out of the bat because surely some people judge\nothers on this matter starting with the race of the person.
