The dog was let off of its leash, came charging up to me and my baby, and started very aggressively barking/snarling. When the owner was calling it to come back to her, it took a few minutes for the dog to obey. There wasn&#39;t really anything I could do because my baby was strapped to me in a baby carrier, and the only escape route I could&#39;ve used was a large stream behind me (so not an option).</p>\n\n<p>I love dogs, and I&#39;ve owned 2 great dogs. Incidents like what I experienced (and much worse ones) are why leash laws were created. Unless you&#39;re at a fenced-in dog park or something, it&#39;s just irresponsible to let your dog off leash. Dogs are animals, and there is no way to predict what they&#39;ll do at any given moment. Keep your dogs on their leash.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lsy1vi/cmv_dogs_should_be_kept_on_a_leash_in_public/","title":"CMV: Dogs should be kept on a leash in public places","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-26T19:35:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-26 19:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"0d2b8615-4003-5c2f-be83-9d814a4a9767","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lsy1vi/cmv_dogs_should_be_kept_on_a_leash_in_public/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lsy1vi/cmv_dogs_should_be_kept_on_a_leash_in_public/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"OrdinaryDust195","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/OrdinaryDust195","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"OrdinaryDust195","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：在公共场所应该用绳子拴住狗。","the_new_excerpt":"今天在公共公园，我和一只狗以及我的宝宝有了一次不好的经历。那只狗\n它被放了下来，冲到我和我的宝宝面前，开始非常的。\n咄咄逼人的吠叫/咆哮。当主人在呼唤它回来的时候\n她，花了几分钟的时间 狗服从。没有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：在公共場所應該用繩子拴住狗。","the_new_excerpt":"今天在公共公園，我和一隻狗以及我的寶寶有了一次不好的經歷。那隻狗\n它被放了下來，衝到我和我的寶寶面前，開始非常的。\n咄咄逼人的吠叫/咆哮。當主人在呼喚它回來的時候\n她，花了幾分鐘的時間 狗服從。沒有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-38cdfdf4-246f-5143-8534-94489070445f","excerpt":"So to expand on the title, conservatives tend to mistrust, fear and/or hate\nunfamiliar cultures and lifestyles, while liberals tend to do the same in\nregards to people who support traditional power structures and lifestyles,\nconservatives, and anyone who they have labelled a bigot in some form…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ls5duk/cmv_the_average_liberal_is_exactly_as_hateful_as/","title":"CMV: The average liberal is exactly as hateful as the average conservative, they just target different groups","date":"February 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：一般的自由派和一般的保守派一样，都是充满仇恨的，只是针对的群体不同而已。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，扩展一下标题，保守派倾向于不信任，恐惧和/或仇恨\n陌生的文化和生活方式，而自由主义者往往也会在。\n关于支持传统权力结构和生活方式的人。\n保守派，以及任何被他们贴上偏执标签的人... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：一般的自由派和一般的保守派一樣，都是充滿仇恨的，只是針對的羣體不同而已。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，擴展一下標題，保守派傾向於不信任，恐懼和/或仇恨\n陌生的文化和生活方式，而自由主義者往往也會在。\n關於支持傳統權力結構和生活方式的人。\n保守派，以及任何被他們貼上偏執標籤的人... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-b8a148ee-0ba3-57b9-b8b3-236223786e4c","excerpt":"I’ve seen so many people getting mad at older dudes for dating young women.\nThink mid 50’s dating a 20-30 year old.
