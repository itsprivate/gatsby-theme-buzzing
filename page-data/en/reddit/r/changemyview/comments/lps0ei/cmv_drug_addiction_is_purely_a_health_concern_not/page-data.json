I am, to be clear, not saying that doing this would make these cartels completely disappear.</p>\n\n<p>The legal pursuit of not just drug dealers but drug consumers as well having been proven to be massive resource sucking black hole that, for a long time was just a giant excuse to crack down on minority communities such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIzTpnYsRxg\">black people and hippies</a>. Through the contiuing efforts of the police and the legal sector tax payer money is being wasted to put consumers of drugs in prison for what is oftentimes a tiny amount of weed. This very money could be spent educating the public and campaigning for awareness and more education something that would potentially have an even bigger effect on drug usage of the general public than the imprisonment of said people.</p>\n\n<p>Under the current policies in most countries people struggling with addiction are nearly unable to seek out professional help. In places that legalized it on the other hand addicts were able to seek out help and focus on getting better instead of seeking for ways to fund their addictions. </p>\n\n<p>Another phanomenon illustrated by the prohibition and modern history alike is that by banning a substance it becomes more potent as there is a financial inscentive to make it as potent as possible and by extension make it more dangerous. </p>\n\n<p>DISCLAIMER: I am in no way advocating for drug usage, in fact I haven&#39;t even once tried alcohol despite being able to and within my legal rights to do so in a country with a heavy drinking culture</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sorry if I phrased a few things a little weird here, I don&#39;t speak english natively so I&#39;m sometimes not quite sure how to make texts and sentences sound natural.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lps0ei/cmv_drug_addiction_is_purely_a_health_concern_not/","title":"CMV: Drug addiction is purely a health concern, not a legal one, and any and every drug should at the very least be decriminalized, if not legalized.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-22T17:42:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-22 17:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"7e747bea-d668-5057-b2cb-149c6cdf7224","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lps0ei/cmv_drug_addiction_is_purely_a_health_concern_not/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lps0ei/cmv_drug_addiction_is_purely_a_health_concern_not/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"L_Lautsprecher","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/L_Lautsprecher","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"L_Lautsprecher","score":699,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：吸毒纯粹是一个健康问题，而不是法律问题，任何一种毒品即使不合法化，至少也应该非刑罪化。","the_new_excerpt":"正如标题所说，我认为所有的毒品都应该合法化\n而这里的要点是为什么。\n\n选择的自由，无论多么糟糕的决定都应该是：\n被认为是一项人权，你选择在你的身体里放什么东西的最后决定权。\n应该还是由你来决定。\n\n该...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：吸毒純粹是一個健康問題，而不是法律問題，任何一種毒品即使不合法化，至少也應該非刑罪化。","the_new_excerpt":"正如標題所說，我認爲所有的毒品都應該合法化\n而這裏的要點是爲什麼。\n\n選擇的自由，無論多麼糟糕的決定都應該是：\n被認爲是一項人權，你選擇在你的身體裏放什麼東西的最後決定權。\n應該還是由你來決定。\n\n該...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-5f9c4862-6270-524c-af24-f1cfb4f38db8","excerpt":"when movie directors replace white characters with black characters( like how\nthey cast Jodie Turner-Smith for the role of Queen Anne Boleyn, a clearly white\nfigure and historical character) white people aren't allowed to complain without\nbeing called racist or having white fragility.\n\nand when…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lpgy7d/cmv_if_casting_scarlet_johanson_was_tonedeaf/","title":"CMV: If casting scarlet Johanson was tone-deaf because the character is not accurately played by a trans actor, then replacing white characters with black actors should be treated with the same criticism.","date":"February 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：如果说选角猩红的约翰森是因为这个角色没有被一个跨性别演员准确地扮演，那么用黑人演员代替白人角色也应该受到同样的批评。","the_new_excerpt":"当电影导演将白人角色替换成黑人角色时（比如说\n他们让朱迪-特纳-史密斯出演安妮-波林女王，一个明显的白人。\n人物和历史人物）白人不允许抱怨而不\n被称为种族主义者或有 白人的脆弱性，\n\n而当...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：如果說選角猩紅的約翰森是因爲這個角色沒有被一個跨性別演員準確地扮演，那麼用黑人演員代替白人角色也應該受到同樣的批評。","the_new_excerpt":"當電影導演將白人角色替換成黑人角色時（比如說\n他們讓朱迪-特納-史密斯出演安妮-波林女王，一個明顯的白人。\n人物和歷史人物）白人不允許抱怨而不\n被稱爲種族主義者或有 白人的脆弱性，\n\n而當...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-b3f57a4c-a1a0-58bf-88e9-318d423ca908","excerpt":"I am not a smoker but in Oregon we recently voted on upping the cigarette tax (I\ndidn’t) and I find the whole thing rather ridiculous.
