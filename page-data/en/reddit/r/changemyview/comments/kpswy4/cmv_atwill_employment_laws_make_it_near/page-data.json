Mostly protected characteristics, like sex, race and disability, as well as protections from being punished for refusing unsafe work and the like. </p>\n\n<p>I think most people can agree that it should be illegal to fire someone for refusing undergo measurably unsafe tasks, or because of immutable things like whats in your pants and the colour of your skin. </p>\n\n<p>If you dont agree, this cmv isn&#39;t for you, thats not what im debating here. </p>\n\n<p>So my problem is that if I can fire someone for what ever reason, its too hard to prove why I fired you. </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say I work just fine at my job for a year and my boss finds out I&#39;m gay at an office party. I get fired the next morning. </p>\n\n<p>If not for at will employment it would be very hard to make a case that I wasn&#39;t fired for being gay, as nothing about my work output changed in the time between me preforming well and being fired. </p>\n\n<p>But with at will employment there are literally a million other explanations that can&#39;t be measured outside of my bosses perception. </p>\n\n<p>I just dont see how wrongful termination laws can be enforced effectively without removing at will employment.</p>\n\n<p>Edit/mass reply: i agree there are disincentives to firing an otherwise productive employee, but I dont think that addresses how people are never perfect logical actors, and also how malice comes into play. </p>\n\n<p>Many people would gladly have to retrain an employee at a cost <strong>if they believe being X (gay, black, muslim) is a detriment in and of itself</strong> </p>\n\n<p>People who would fire someone for being Jewish probably believes they are untrustworthy and a risk. So to the anti smite its not an illogical decision.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kpswy4/cmv_atwill_employment_laws_make_it_near/","title":"CMV: At-will employment
