There is no reason for them to be excluded or separate. I will be referring in terms of USA, however, because that’s the only place I have experience with. </p>\n\n<p>As far as I’m aware the only reason they are often separated is because they are considered “non essential”. Your teeth and eyes are pretty damn essential. You have to eat every day, you have to see every day.  You shouldn’t have enroll in a separate plan to take care of them. </p>\n\n<p>I think we still need to have basic services included. Basic meaning dental exam yearly, X-rays every certain amount of years, things like cavities and chipped teeth. For vision, a yearly exam, glasses if needed, treatment for conditions luke glaucoma or cataracts, etc. </p>\n\n<p>What about dental and vision care that isn’t (usually) essential like braces or contacts? They could be excluded in cheaper plan options unless medically necessary. There are cases where braces are necessary. As a child, my teeth were straight but my upper palate didn’t grow properly so I needed braces to be able to have my jaw align. That’s essential to chewing and medically necessary. Braces for cosmetic reasons could reasonably be excluded. I’m not sure if there’s any conditions where glasses won’t work and contacts are needed, but otherwise I think contacts are possible to exclude as well. </p>\n\n<p>I honestly can’t think of any reason to keep them separate. If you think so, change my view.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m3luac/cmv_basic_dental_and_vision_should_be_included_in/","title":"CMV: Basic dental and vision should be included in all health insurance","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-12T19:37:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-12 19:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"30357546-5dda-5250-9a58-b98760cf2e19","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m3luac/cmv_basic_dental_and_vision_should_be_included_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m3luac/cmv_basic_dental_and_vision_should_be_included_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"G_E_E_S_E","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/G_E_E_S_E","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"G_E_E_S_E","score":60,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：所有健康保险都应包括基本的牙科和视力。","the_new_excerpt":"不管是万能险还是私人保险都不重要。没有理由\n  我指的是美国。\n然而，因为那是我唯一有经验的地方。\n\n据我所知，他们经常分开的唯一原因是他们... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：所有健康保險都應包括基本的牙科和視力。","the_new_excerpt":"不管是萬能險還是私人保險都不重要。沒有理由\n  我指的是美國。\n然而，因爲那是我唯一有經驗的地方。\n\n據我所知，他們經常分開的唯一原因是他們... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-2ed2e955-24f8-5559-8d1d-36729a3bb78a","excerpt":"The murder of 33 year old marketing executive Sarah Everard here in the UK was\nbeyond tragic and I think it’s hit public consciousness particularly hard\nbecause for all intents and purposes, she took the right precautions (busy\nLondon street, wore bright clothing etc.) and yet she was abducted and…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m3ebe4/cmv_no_amount_of_grassroots_education_or_men/","title":"CMV: No amount of grassroots education or “men being better” will eliminate murderers and rapists in our society and it’s not victim blaming to suggest ways to avoid these psychopaths.","date":"March 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：再多的草根教育或 \"男人更优秀 \"都无法消灭社会上的杀人犯和强奸犯，提出避免这些心理变态者的方法并不是在指责受害者。","the_new_excerpt":"33岁的营销主管莎拉-埃弗拉德在英国这里被谋杀。\n惨不忍睹 我想这对公众的意识冲击特别大\n因为从所有的意图和目的来看，她采取了正确的预防措施（忙）。\n伦敦街头，穿着鲜艳的衣服等），然而她却被绑架了，......。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：再多的草根教育或 \"男人更優秀 \"都無法消滅社會上的殺人犯和強姦犯，提出避免這些心理變態者的方法並不是在指責受害者。","the_new_excerpt":"33歲的營銷主管莎拉-埃弗拉德在英國這裏被謀殺。\n慘不忍睹 我想這對公衆的意識衝擊特別大\n因爲從所有的意圖和目的來看，她採取了正確的預防措施（忙）。\n倫敦街頭，穿着鮮豔的衣服等），然而她卻被綁架了，......。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-6b0c5aa9-0cf0-5f46-a676-9fa2ed4dcabf","excerpt":"Let me preface this by saying I am not a staunch advocate for integrative\nmedicine.
