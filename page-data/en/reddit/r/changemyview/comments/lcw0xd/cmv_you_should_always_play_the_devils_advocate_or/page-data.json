Everyone has inherent bias. This is true for all issues and sides, but playing the other side is always a good way to check for any inherent bias you may have that you might not even know you have. I think that it&#39;s always important to try to understand the other side, even if they&#39;re factually, scientifically wrong. Because understanding doesn&#39;t mean agreement. By &quot;playing the devil&#39;s advocate,&quot; you gain a greater understanding of not only the other side, but also yours. There is no reasonable reason to not.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: New here, didn&#39;t read the rules. Sorry I couldn&#39;t be here for 3-hours-plus. I need to finish coursework and hopefully get more than 5 hours of sleep. Thanks for debating everyone.
