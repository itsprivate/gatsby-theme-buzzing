It is fine to report on these events, but IMO it is <del>incredibly irresponsible</del> (EDIT: negligent) of journalists to leave out the very important detail - namely the lack of a causal link between these adverse events and the vaccine(s) - out of the headline. Too often this piece of information is relegated to the sub-headline, or even worse, buried paragraphs deep into the article. Here&#39;s an example from the <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/3126785/hong-kong-logs-10-new-covid-19-cases-10-households-ordered\">South China Morning Post</a> (arguably the most reputable English broadsheet in Hong Kong, where I&#39;m from), but I&#39;ve seen examples from other places too.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t help but feel that these headlines are contributing to vaccine hesitancy. Maybe the authors believe that most readers are able to distinguish between correlation and causation, but that is surely a dangerous assumption. In Hong Kong, for example, we&#39;re already seeing people not showing up to their vaccine appointments because of these fears; in my opinion the media are partly responsible for this.
