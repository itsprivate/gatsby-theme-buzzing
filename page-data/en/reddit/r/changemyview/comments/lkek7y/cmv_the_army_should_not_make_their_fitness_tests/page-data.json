They found that women were not passing at the same rates as men, so they are considering lowering the bar / changing the tests that women do. I feel like this is a bad thing for 2 main reasons.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The fitness test getting easier means less fit people in the army which means a less qualified army, could lead to more deaths. I have no evidence of this, just seems like it would happen.</li>\n<li>Everyone should be on an even playing field. If it&#39;s sexist to say that women are not as fit as men, it should be sexist to propose lowering the bar for women too, right? I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m sexist for saying women should take the same tests, or sexist for saying they should take an easier one.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So they had two options from what I can tell; either accept that not as many women will pass as men (which might lead to really bad PR when some news outlet &#39;exposes&#39; the military for letting men in more than women) or lower the bar (which might lead to really bad PR when some news outlet &#39;exposes&#39; the military for suggesting that women need different tests).</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a good option here. IMO they should keep the tests the same.</p>\n\n<p>Talking about the Army ACFT fitness test here.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: My view was changed. The point of this test isn&#39;t &quot;this is the bar you need to meet so you don&#39;t get your fellow servicefolk killed&quot;. The test is more &quot;You should be a healthy person&quot; and a healthy female and a healthy male have different strengths and weaknesses so they should have different tests. I still maintain that the standards for specific roles such as infantrypersons should remain equal because the purpose of those standards is for the safety of the servicefolk.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: Not sure if my view has been changed. I&#39;ve been getting conflicting information from people and took their word for it potentially mistakenly. I need to better educate myself on the ACTF and overall how the army works / sets their standards. Perhaps you guys can debate it amongst yourselves some more but I need to read for a while. </p>\n\n<p>I maintain a belief that for specific roles where we need to set a bar for the safety of everyone, that bar should be the same regardless of gender. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s any specific tests for specific roles that have different standards for men and women.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
