I had the opportunity to live in America for college and I worked at restaurants. The pay was amazing. I was earning a ridiculous amount of money. Where I’m from, this was the salary of a high-level manager. I haven’t even graduated and I’m already out earning them. Granted, I know the living standards are different but that’s obvious since your standard of living is higher. The lifestyle of a middle-class person in the Philippines is like the lifestyle of the poor in America. I can’t even begin to describe the poverty that the masses in my country live through (most of the population is very, very poor.) It’s horrifying. I would rather be dead.</p>\n\n<p>I bought a new iphone, some clothes and gaming laptop, but I kept my expenses to a minimum. I ate out once a month, counted every dollar I spent on groceries/essentials, took public transpo/bike or hitched a ride with co-workers instead of an uber, always ate the employees meal, would take home the free peanuts in Five Guys, etc. I was able to save up so much money while still buying a few luxuries here and there. </p>\n\n<p>During my time there, I met a lot of people. A lot of immigrants who worked hard, single moms who worked hard, single moms who were lazy and mooched off childcare, people my age who worked hard, people my age who slacked off. All kinds of people. I have a lot of respect for the immigrants. We all agree, USA is fucking amazing. We all work our ass off but the payoff is great. Compare to our countries where people slave for a measly $4/per day minimum wage. You can work and work your life away in the Philippines, and there’s very little chance for upward mobility. America is so easy in comparison. These immigrants started off poor but hard work paid off and now they can live a comfortable middle-class lifestyle while still sending money back home to support their families. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s okay to be lazy, if you want to be lazy. I met someone who enjoyed a care-free lifestyle. He chose not to work hard because he wants to be laid-back. I respect that. But people on the internet, reddit especially, constantly complain about capitalism or how third-world the USA is becoming. I know you’ve got issues with healthcare and everyone hating each other, but it’s really not that bad… USA is still great. The people constantly complaining just don’t have any perspective on the world. They should book a flight to their third-world country of choice and see for themselves. I always find it ironic how these people hate the rich, when they are actually already considered rich in the eyes of us, people from the third-world. They hate their boss, but they always call-off or are always late then get angry when they are reprimanded. Of course you’ll be paid less and fired more. Your work ethic is terrible! They want to be socialist/communist, but they’re exactly the kind of people who will make communism fail. </p>\n\n<p>My life experience has shown me that the American dream is still alive. I know it’s got issues, like the after mentioned health care, racial tensions, shootings, etc. but in terms of opportunity, it is still unmatched. Hard work and conscientiousness can get you far. People are just too lazy or have such a narrow worldview that they can’t put things into perspective.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/n1l2fn/cmvamerica_is_still_the_land_of_opportunity_hard/","title":"cmv:America is still the land of opportunity.
