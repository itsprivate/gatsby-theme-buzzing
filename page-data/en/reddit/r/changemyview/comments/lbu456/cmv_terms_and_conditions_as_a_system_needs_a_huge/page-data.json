After witnessing what&#39;s been going on with the GameStop stock drama I decided to learn more about it. When it comes to Robinhood stopping trading of GameStop&#39;s stock and these came about that it was done to help out the hedge funds from going bankrupt.  If a class action lawsuit was to be filed it wouldn&#39;t even see the light of day.  Everyone who downloaded the app and used it agreed to Robinhood&#39;s Terms of Service. And wouldn&#39;t you know it, deep within all the lawyer speak and tiny font and extremely lengthy list of things you blindly agree to is that:</p>\n\n<p>Robinhood has a right to adjust prices and not necessarily guarantee that the number it shows to be paid isn&#39;t what you&#39;ll be paid and among other things, you give up your right to filing a class action lawsuit for anything done with Robinhood.</p>\n\n<p>This has been going on for decades.  &quot;Facebook has been selling my personal data to advertisers and profiting off of it!&quot; You agreed to it.  &quot;Twitter banned Trump because he incited  violence and that&#39;s not fair because he&#39;s my President and I love him! FREE SPEECH!&quot; Yeah too bad, he agreed to the rules.</p>\n\n<p>I think much like lawmakers getting a bill 4 hours before a vote to pass it, and they scribble things in the margins and make this that yada yada to the point nobody actually has any idea how anything works because it&#39;s too much to comprehend, companies use ToS so that the only thing that is their responsibility and that they can be held accountable for is receiving a profit.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not saying I think companies don&#39;t have a right to watch their backs. Of course they should. If I get in an accident that isn&#39;t my fault cause some guy made an illegal turn, I shouldn&#39;t be responsible for paying the repairs. What these ToS do is the complete opposite extreme.  </p>\n\n<p>You know games that you buy digitally on Playstation or what have you, you don&#39;t actually own those games. You&#39;re basically just renting them.  Playstation has every right to revoke your access to that game because you named your character &quot;CuntPrivate&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I believe the system needs an overhaul or at least regulated to prevent companies to be greedily unaccountable for any wrong doing. They know consumers don&#39;t read all the legal mumbo jumbo. It would take days to read some of theses all the way through. They know this and exploit it. To me that&#39;s wrong.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lbu456/cmv_terms_and_conditions_as_a_system_needs_a_huge/","title":"CMV: \"Terms and Conditions\" as a system needs a huge overhaul.
