It brings me joy. I like making and maintaining clothes and putting different outfits together, and thus, it’s more fun to have a great amount of clothes. This does not mean that this is my only priority or hobby or that I value it more than people in my life. </p>\n\n<p>Why is it so wrong to value aesthetics and material things? </p>\n\n<p>Are there a few pockets of society where people measure themselves by cars and bags they don’t even value and feel terrible if they don’t measure up to their peers? Sure. I’m not denying that. But the average layman? I just don’t see it. I see people who like having a high quality pan for cooking and some smooth new books and some different pairs of shoes to choose from.
