Instead of using race as a factor in admissions colleges should use income, zip code, wealth or some other metric to help poorer Americans. </p>\n\n<p>I just think it is fundamentally unfair that an upper middle class African American has a better chance at getting into a top tier school than a first generation Vietnamese immigrant who is the first in their family to go to college solely because of race. </p>\n\n<p>The main reason I hear cited for the continuation of affirmative action is the that minority groups have faced disadvantages in the past they should get preferential treatment into colleges now. I don’t agree with this for a couple reasons. First I feel like a need based program would serve the same need without using race as a factor. If a minority is disadvantaged because of discrimination they would benefit under a need based system because of their lower income. Secondly just because some minorities were discriminated against in the past doesn’t mean we should discriminate against other people (Asian and Caucasian Americans) today. In essence two wrongs do not make a right.  </p>\n\n<p>I want to hear other points of view and am open to awarding deltas and having my view changed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/l34jjg/cmv_affirmative_action_should_be_replaced_with_a/","title":"CMV: Affirmative action should be replaced with a need based program","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-23T11:08:38.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-23 11:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"edcd9225-be1e-5f5d-bc92-f3a5247f81c4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l34jjg/cmv_affirmative_action_should_be_replaced_with_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l34jjg/cmv_affirmative_action_should_be_replaced_with_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Historical-Ratio-343","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Historical-Ratio-343","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Historical-Ratio-343","score":154,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：应以基于需求的方案取代平权行动。","the_new_excerpt":"我不认为平权行动是最好的或最公平的方式来决定谁可以获得\n进入大学。与其将种族作为录取的一个因素，高校应该是\n用收入、邮编、财富或其他一些指标来帮助更贫穷的美国人。\n\n我只是认为这是根本上不公平的 一个中上层阶级...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：應以基於需求的方案取代平權行動。","the_new_excerpt":"我不認爲平權行動是最好的或最公平的方式來決定誰可以獲得\n進入大學。與其將種族作爲錄取的一個因素，高校應該是\n用收入、郵編、財富或其他一些指標來幫助更貧窮的美國人。\n\n我只是認爲這是根本上不公平的 一箇中上層階級...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-cd8f0863-f04d-589e-a4c3-cfc41b63d791","excerpt":"Possible spoilers if you've not seen the movie(though I don't recommend...it's\ntruly awful)\n\nI'm 11 minutes in and so far:\n\nMulan has a sister.\n\nApparently her dad is poor, instead of an honored rich man/family.\n\nIt starts with her as a kid\n\nShe somehow has magic kung fu abilities that defy gravity,…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/l34zy6/cmv_the_live_action_dinsey_mulan_movie_is/","title":"CMV: The live action Dinsey mulan movie is absolutely awful and on par with how awful the live action Avatar the last air bender is.","date":"January 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：真人版丁西mulan电影绝对是可怕的，和真人版《阿凡达》最后的空降兵一样可怕。","the_new_excerpt":"如果你没有看过这部电影，可能会有破坏性的内容（虽然我不推荐......它是\n糟透了)\n\n到目前为止，我只做了11分钟。\n\n木兰有个妹妹\n\n显然她的爸爸很穷，而不是一个尊贵的富翁/家庭。\n\n这要从她小时候说起\n\n她不知何故有神奇的功夫能力，不顾地心引力，... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：真人版丁西mulan電影絕對是可怕的，和真人版《阿凡達》最後的空降兵一樣可怕。","the_new_excerpt":"如果你沒有看過這部電影，可能會有破壞性的內容（雖然我不推薦......它是\n糟透了)\n\n到目前爲止，我只做了11分鐘。\n\n木蘭有個妹妹\n\n顯然她的爸爸很窮，而不是一個尊貴的富翁/家庭。\n\n這要從她小時候說起\n\n她不知何故有神奇的功夫能力，不顧地心引力，... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-476d47ee-fbc2-5dda-b998-5ec27f66548b","excerpt":"Most everyone hates Canadian geese.
