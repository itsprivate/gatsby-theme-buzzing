Well the first thing a lot of people like to go to for a good dig on them is &quot;guy must have a small penis haha!&quot; Because that&#39;s easy right? Because if you have a small penis you are less of a human, especially less of a male! People with big penises don&#39;t do that! </p>\n\n<p>Then there is us. The regular ass dudes with not so great penises. I may not speak for the rest of us but not having a large penis is something we are made very aware of as the media, porn, and even women make very clear what a big penis is. So from puberty we become self conscious of this. Often ashamed to reveal our penises to our sexual partners. Then we hear these insults. We see how it is used to demasculate and insult. Then we look down and just, well we just feel worse. We feel we aren&#39;t up to snuff so to say and become even more self conscious. So many we could find a different way to insult asshole dudes besides their theoretical penis size?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: to the people making small penis jokes and generally being rude, way to go, you must be very cool. Good to know the mods are active.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/mfhekc/cmv_people_should_stop_using_the_small_penis/","title":"CMV: People should stop using the \"small penis\" insult when going after asshole, douchebags, etc...
