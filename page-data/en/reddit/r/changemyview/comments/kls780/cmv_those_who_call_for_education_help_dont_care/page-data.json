However, with living in a rural area of a heavily rural state I&#39;ve only ever seen 1 person or advertisement advocating for rural STEMification and that was with a recent gubernatorial candidate who has a STEM background in a rural state. It seems, given that disparity, that the concern isn&#39;t STEM education. I want to know why, as it seems, rural America, specifically it&#39;s education, isn&#39;t important to those who advocate for educational increases and such.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thank you all for this discussion, the subreddit did its job and has changed my view.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kls780/cmv_those_who_call_for_education_help_dont_care/","title":"CMV: Those who call for education help don't care about Rural Schools.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"December 29, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-29T09:35:14.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-29 09:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"223d5a2f-c2e9-5720-876a-3d963f62494f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kls780/cmv_those_who_call_for_education_help_dont_care/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kls780/cmv_those_who_call_for_education_help_dont_care/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Quarentus","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Quarentus","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Quarentus","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：那些呼吁教育帮助的人并不关心乡村学校。","the_new_excerpt":"我每天都看到广告鼓吹给市中心提供更多的资金。\n学校，因为他们没有足够的机会学习STEM和计算机科学\n教育。然而，由于生活在一个以农村为主的州的农村地区，我\n只见过1个人或广告宣传农村…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：那些呼籲教育幫助的人並不關心鄉村學校。","the_new_excerpt":"我每天都看到廣告鼓吹給市中心提供更多的資金。\n學校，因爲他們沒有足夠的機會學習STEM和計算機科學\n教育。然而，由於生活在一個以農村爲主的州的農村地區，我\n只見過1個人或廣告宣傳農村…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-289da43c-5030-5a2c-bb59-d4cab1098545","excerpt":"If you choose to eat more typical meat (cows, pigs, chickens, sheep, etc.) you\nshouldn't be judging people for doing the same thing with cats or dogs.
