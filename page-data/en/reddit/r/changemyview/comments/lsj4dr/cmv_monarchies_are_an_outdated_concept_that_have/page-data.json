When laws are passed by parliament and signed into law, it is referred to as “given royal assent.” </p>\n\n<p>While the Royal Family only has a ceremonious role in government, the whole concept seems ridiculous and should be scrapped in favour of these countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Bahamas, etc) becoming republics. The legitimacy of the governments of these countries is rooted in the people, and I do not see any reason for them to have any sort of deference to a foreign royal family a half a world away. </p>\n\n<p>Even the UK should remove the Royal Family from even ceremonious roles in government, and just become a republic. There is nothing about western democratic values that suggests being “royal” by virtue of birth or marriage is aligned with it. </p>\n\n<p>Is there a compelling reason that former British colonies should retain their deference to the Queen? Or that Britain should even have a Royal Family for that matter?
