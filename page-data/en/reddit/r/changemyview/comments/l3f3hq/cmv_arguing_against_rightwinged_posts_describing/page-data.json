In the comments I saw many people bringing up Sarah Huckabee-Sanders and Kelly Anne Conway as counter-arguments for “ugly” conservative women. I believe these arguments are not only a waste of time but are counter productive and lowers the bar for what we should be comparing our elected and appointed officials on. Liberals have a better stance in arguing by comparing accomplishments, ethics, and morals over looks. By playing the game that conservatives do, we reduce these hard working women down to just their looks which is insulting for everyone. and yes I will include Sarah Huckabee-Sanders, Kelly Mcenany, and Kelly Anne Conway as hard working women as well despite disagreeing with them on most issues. CMV that arguing about a person’s physical attractiveness is a measure to be taken into account at which side is “better”.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/l3f3hq/cmv_arguing_against_rightwinged_posts_describing/","title":"CMV: Arguing against Right-winged posts describing conservative women as “hotter” than liberal women by pointing out “ugly” conservative women is self defeating.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-24T02:29:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-24 02:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"0afec33d-aec1-554e-878f-0afa72202610","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l3f3hq/cmv_arguing_against_rightwinged_posts_describing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l3f3hq/cmv_arguing_against_rightwinged_posts_describing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"ThatIowanGuy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ThatIowanGuy","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ThatIowanGuy","score":63,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：通过指出保守派女性的 \"丑陋 \"来反对描述保守派女性比自由派女性 \"更性感 \"的右翼帖子，是自取其辱。","the_new_excerpt":"我最近看到一个/r/insanepeoplefacebook的帖子，其中一个保守派比较了\n凯利-麦卡纳尼对拜登任命的新闻秘书（记不清名字了）在。\n在长相上等于保守的女人更好。在评论中，我\n看到很多人提起Sarah Huckabee -Sanders和Kelly Anne...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：通過指出保守派女性的 \"醜陋 \"來反對描述保守派女性比自由派女性 \"更性感 \"的右翼帖子，是自取其辱。","the_new_excerpt":"我最近看到一個/r/insanepeoplefacebook的帖子，其中一個保守派比較了\n凱利-麥卡納尼對拜登任命的新聞祕書（記不清名字了）在。\n在長相上等於保守的女人更好。在評論中，我\n看到很多人提起Sarah Huckabee -Sanders和Kelly Anne...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-efabe748-bd73-5120-9e6f-10975e45e06a","excerpt":"Many school teachers claim that their goal, beyond teaching a particular subject\nmatter, is to teach their students to think critically and be able to process\ninformation, but I think they have forgotten the basic building blocks of being\nable to do that.\n\nAs humans we have a bunch of natural biases…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/l3o5m1/cmv_classes_focused_on_critical_thinking_the_laws/","title":"CMV: Classes focused on critical thinking, the laws of logic, and how to verify the authenticity of information should be required curriculum for young kids alongside math, science, and language skills.","date":"January 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：专注于批判性思维、逻辑法则以及如何验证信息的真实性的课程，应该与数学、科学和语言技能一起成为年轻孩子的必修课。","the_new_excerpt":"许多学校的教师声称，他们的目标，除了教授某一特定学科外，还包括\n事，就是要教会学生批判性思考，并能处理好他们的问题。\n信息，但我认为他们已经忘记了做人的基本要素。\n能够做到这一点。\n\n作为人类，我们有一堆天然的偏见... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：專注於批判性思維、邏輯法則以及如何驗證信息的真實性的課程，應該與數學、科學和語言技能一起成爲年輕孩子的必修課。","the_new_excerpt":"許多學校的教師聲稱，他們的目標，除了教授某一特定學科外，還包括\n事，就是要教會學生批判性思考，並能處理好他們的問題。\n信息，但我認爲他們已經忘記了做人的基本要素。\n能夠做到這一點。\n\n作爲人類，我們有一堆天然的偏見... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-b153f68e-0cbb-5e21-8b4d-4cf94e2595c8","excerpt":"First off, I am Irish and do not condone the murder of innocent lives in any\ncircumstance.
