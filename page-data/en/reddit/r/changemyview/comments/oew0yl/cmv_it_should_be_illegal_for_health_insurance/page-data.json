In my opinion it should be illegal for an insurance provider to have access to &#39;plan discounts&#39; that the average consumer cannot have access to. An example, I have needed some blood work and imaging recently. Quest diagnostics billed nearly $800 total for 2 round of blood work. The insurance company paid approximately $80 of it, due to the plan discount. This is the case across the board. Needed an MRI, cost was $2200, the plan discount brought it down to $950. To be clear, they reduced the total amount to those values via plan discounts, I&#39;m not complaining that they didn&#39;t cover the remainder.</p>\n\n<p>The US has a major issue with their cost of Healthcare. Can someone change my view and explain to me what the benefit of allowing this is, versus the MRI just costing $950 and the blood work just costing $40 and forcing the insurance company to pay the 100% (assuming the plan states they need to cover 100%).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/oew0yl/cmv_it_should_be_illegal_for_health_insurance/","title":"CMV: It should be illegal for health insurance providers to have access to discounts that the average consumer does not","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"July 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-06T15:42:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-06 15:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"423596c0-bdc2-5463-962b-22a62e0e0a48","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/oew0yl/cmv_it_should_be_illegal_for_health_insurance/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/oew0yl/cmv_it_should_be_illegal_for_health_insurance/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"cycleski","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/cycleski","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"cycleski","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3bf742ad-66c1-526e-8dd9-9f89cdc407f0","excerpt":"As the heading says, certain breeds of dogs (and other animals too), just\nshouldn’t exist for the animal’s welfare, I know so many people that have owned\na pug that have needed to take them to the vets just to fix their breathing\nbecause their face structures are just absolutely destroyed through…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/oem7nf/cmv_dog_breeds_such_as_pugs_dachshunds_and/","title":"CMV: Dog breeds such as pugs, dachshunds and Bulldogs should be classified as animal cruelty.","date":"July 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：パグやダックスフンド、ブルドッグなどの犬種は、動物虐待に分類されるべきです。","the_new_excerpt":"見出しにあるように、ある種の犬種（他の動物も）は、動物の福祉のために存在すべきではありません。\n動物の福祉のためには存在すべきではありません。私はパグを飼っていた多くの人を知っています。\nパグを飼っていて、呼吸を直すために獣医に連れて行かなければならない人をたくさん知っています。\nなぜなら、彼らの顔の構造は完全に破壊されているから...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV: 狗的品种，如巴哥犬、腊肠犬和斗牛犬，应被归类为虐待动物。","the_new_excerpt":"正如标题所说，某些品种的狗（也包括其他动物），只是\n为了动物的福利，它们不应该存在。\n巴哥犬的人都需要带它们去看兽医，以解决它们的呼吸问题\n因为它们的脸部结构绝对是被破坏的......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV: 狗的品種，如巴哥犬、臘腸犬和鬥牛犬，應被歸類爲虐待動物。","the_new_excerpt":"正如標題所說，某些品種的狗（也包括其他動物），只是\n爲了動物的福利，它們不應該存在。\n巴哥犬的人都需要帶它們去看獸醫，以解決它們的呼吸問題\n因爲它們的臉部結構絕對是被破壞的......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-423596c0-bdc2-5463-962b-22a62e0e0a48","previousId":"RedditPost-3bf742ad-66c1-526e-8dd9-9f89cdc407f0","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/oew0yl/cmv_it_should_be_illegal_for_health_insurance/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
