Such as someone claiming to be wearing a condom during sex when not, or removing the condom during the act. Or someone claiming to be on birth control when they are not. I believe both of these to be rape. I think a minor lying about their age to someone they’ll have sex with is rape. People should be sure that the person they’re fucking is of age, just like everyone needs to take the necessary precautions to stay safe in all situations. This doesn’t make it not rape. I think people need to stop acting like teenagers are blameless in everything. Teens tried as adults is basically us saying “you knew exactly what you were doing”, because they did. I believe this is the same thing. They know exactly what they are doing. I realize this could very easily be he said, she said. That’s also how it is with a lot of rapes. I don’t know, I’ve only formed this opinion within half an hour so I’m not too tied to it yet.
