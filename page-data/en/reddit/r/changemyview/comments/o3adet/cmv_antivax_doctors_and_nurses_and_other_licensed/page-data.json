Being antivax is in direct contraction to everything we are taught in school (and practice) about how the human body works.  </p>\n\n<p>When I was a new mother I was &quot;vaccine hesitant&quot;.  I was not a nurse or have any medical education at the time, I was a younger mother at 23 with a premature child and not a lot of peers for support.  I was online a lot from when I was on bedrest and I got a lot of support there. And a lot of misinformation. I had a BA, with basic science stuff, but nothing more My children received most vaccines (I didn&#39;t do hep B then I don&#39;t think) but I spread them out over a long period.  I didn&#39;t think vaccines caused autism exactly, but maybe they triggered something, or that the risks were higher for complications and just not sure these were really in his best interest - and I thought &quot;natural immunity&quot; was better.  There were nurses who seemed hesitant too, and Dr. Sears even had an alternate schedule and it seemed like <em>maybe</em> something wasn&#39;t perfect with vaccines then. My doctor just went along with it, probably thinking it was better than me not vaccinating at all and if she pushed, I would go that way.  </p>\n\n<p>Then I went back to school after I had my second. </p>\n\n<p>As I learned more in-depth about how the body and immune system worked, as I got better at critically thinking and learned how to evaluate research papers, I realized just how dumb my views were.  I made sure my kids got caught up with <em>everything</em> they hadn&#39;t had yet (hep B and chicken pox) Once I understood it well, everything I was reading that made me hesitant now made me realize how flimsy all those justifications were. They are like the dihydrogen monoxide type pages extolling the dangers of water. Or a three year old trying to explain how the body works.  It&#39;s laughable wrong and at some level also hard to know where to start to contradict - there&#39;s just so much that is bad, how far back in disordered thinking do you really need to go? </p>\n\n<p>Now, I&#39;m all about the vaccinations - with covid, I was <em>very</em> unsure whether they&#39;d be able to make a safe one, but once the research came out, evaluated by other experts, then I&#39;m on board 1000000%.  I got my pfizer three days after it came out in the US.  </p>\n\n<p>I say all this to demonstrate the potential influence of medical professionals on parents (which is when <em>many</em> people become antivax) and they have a professional duty to do no harm, and ignoring science about vaccines does harm.  There are lots of hesitant parents that might be like I was, still reachable in reality, and having medical professionals say any of it gives it a <em>lot</em> of weight.  If you don&#39;t want to believe in medicine, that&#39;s fine, you don&#39;t get a license to practice it.  (or associated licenses)  People are not entitled to their professional licenses.  I think it should include quackery too while we&#39;re at it, but antivax is a good place to start.  </p>\n\n<p>tldr:</p>\n\n<p>Health care professionals with licenses should lose them if they openly promote antivax views. It shows either a grotesque lack of critical thinking, lack of understanding of the body, lack of ability to evaluate research, which is not compatible with a license, or they are having mental health issues and have fallen into conspiracy land from there.  Either way, those are not people who should be able to speak to patients from a position of authority.  </p>\n\n<p>I couldn&#39;t find holes in my logic, but I&#39;m biased as a licensed professional, so I open it to reddit to find the flaws I couldn&#39;t  :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/o3adet/cmv_antivax_doctors_and_nurses_and_other_licensed/","title":"CMV: Antivax doctors and nurses (and other licensed healthcare personnel) should lose their licenses.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"June 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-19T08:46:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-19 08:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"044122b0-b8a4-5d9b-bd47-7e12f35a4e49","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/o3adet/cmv_antivax_doctors_and_nurses_and_other_licensed/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/o3adet/cmv_antivax_doctors_and_nurses_and_other_licensed/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"sapphireminds","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/sapphireminds","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"sapphireminds","score":109,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：アンチワクチンの医師や看護師（その他の認可された医療従事者）は、免許を失うべきです。","the_new_excerpt":"カナダでは、看護師が公然と予防接種反対の意見を述べると、免許を失うことがあります。\n免許を失います。\n\nアメリカでもそうすべきだと思います（理想的には世界でもそうすべきです）。\n\nもしあなたが反ワクチンであれば、それは受け入れがたいレベルの無知を示していると思います。\n批判的に考えることができず、人々の意見を無視していると思います。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：反疫苗的医生和护士（以及其他有执照的医疗保健人员）应该失去他们的执照。","the_new_excerpt":"在加拿大，如果你是一名护士并公开宣传反疫苗的观点，你可以\n你可以失去你的执照。\n\n我认为在美国（最好是全世界）也应该如此。\n\n如果你反疫苗，我认为这显示了一种不可接受的无知水平。\n没有能力进行批判性思考和无视......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：反疫苗的醫生和護士（以及其他有執照的醫療保健人員）應該失去他們的執照。","the_new_excerpt":"在加拿大，如果你是一名護士並公開宣傳反疫苗的觀點，你可以\n你可以失去你的執照。\n\n我認爲在美國（最好是全世界）也應該如此。\n\n如果你反疫苗，我認爲這顯示了一種不可接受的無知水平。\n沒有能力進行批判性思考和無視......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-519068d9-06e6-555c-9ece-b33891a2476e","excerpt":"I think Juneteenth is a particularly bad name for any special day.
