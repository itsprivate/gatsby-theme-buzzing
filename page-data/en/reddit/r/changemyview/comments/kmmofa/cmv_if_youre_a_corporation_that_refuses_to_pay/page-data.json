Like, these folks have heard of modest living, right? Like, you don’t <em>have</em> to have your three houses in the Bahamas while your own employees are struggling to pay for their own home. I hope they know that. </p>\n\n<p>I think it also shows the failures of 21st century American capitalism and its current system. Say what you will about mid-century America (I’m not one to excuse it’s intense racism, sexism, homophobia, etc,.), but at least the CEO-to-employee gap was <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianahembree/2018/05/22/ceo-pay-skyrockets-to-361-times-that-of-the-average-worker/\">a hell of a lot smaller</a> than what we’re seeing now. And these were corporations who could provide their employees with good pay and good homes (like the big three in Detroit and what not). There’s really absolutely no excuse for this to be as disparate and ridiculous as it is here. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, we also had a much stronger union presence, a presence that, I think, should never have died the way it has since the 80’s. It put these corporations in check to make sure that they’re doing their fair share, and their loss in our country has. Meanwhile, countries like Germany have <em>kept</em> their unions. You don’t see the ridiculous wage issues that you see here, do you? </p>\n\n<p>Yet, even without unions, it’s also meaningful to raise the minimum wage, a law-mandated wage that was <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/its-time-we-revived-fdrs-wages-of-a-decent-living-34344\">literally built to support a decent living standard</a>, not a teenage employee’s booze fountain. </p>\n\n<p>And before people say “Oh, just go to college!”: First off, how can you expect an 18-year-old high schooler to suddenly decide what they’ll do for the rest of their lives? Second, how do you know if that chosen degree will even get them the job they spent so much time and money for? </p>\n\n<p>Also, why should a 20-something today be expected to live at their parents’ house (a house that might be abusive and shitty, mind you), when a 20-something 50 years ago could get a decent apartment with a less-than-extraordinary job at, I don’t know, K-Mart or something? Maybe even while paying for the (then extremely cheap) tuition? Again, don’t you think that’s a bit interesting in of itself? </p>\n\n<p>What I’m trying to say is: If you’re a big corporation that refuses to pay a living wage to your employees, you don’t deserve to be in business. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, I would like to see my views challenged.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kmmofa/cmv_if_youre_a_corporation_that_refuses_to_pay/","title":"CMV: If you’re a corporation that refuses to pay its employees a living wage, you don’t deserve to be in business.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"December 30, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-30T09:36:30.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-30 09:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"aab14eb8-edb9-5f0a-88c5-ee4bea8d30c4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kmmofa/cmv_if_youre_a_corporation_that_refuses_to_pay/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kmmofa/cmv_if_youre_a_corporation_that_refuses_to_pay/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Pixelcitizen98","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pixelcitizen98","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Pixelcitizen98","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：如果你是一家拒绝向员工支付最低生活工资的公司，你就不配做生意。","the_new_excerpt":"在一个中产阶级日益减少的国家，以及一个庞大的\n有多少市民在努力支付房款，我发现\n看到价值数百万美元的大型组织尝试他们的\n最难确保工资与…不符","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：如果你是一家拒絕向員工支付最低生活工資的公司，你就不配做生意。","the_new_excerpt":"在一箇中產階級日益減少的國家，以及一個龐大的\n有多少市民在努力支付房款，我發現\n看到價值數百萬美元的大型組織嘗試他們的\n最難確保工資與…不符","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-007c2bbf-c56d-5e90-86d2-c2a90c95aa2f","excerpt":"First I should just state up front my credentials here: I'm mostly familiar with\nthe MCU and DC films, but I have read a few comics in my day and certainly gone\ndown some deep wiki rabbit holes reading up on various characters and events.\n\nOne of the things that bugs me the most about these…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kmpakt/cmv_superheroes_who_refuse_to_kill_regularly/","title":"CMV: Superheroes who refuse to kill regularly homicidal supervillains are being naive and selfish, and it would be better to kill them.","date":"December 30, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：拒绝杀死定期杀人的超级恶棍的超级英雄是天真和自私的，不如杀了他们。","the_new_excerpt":"首先，我应该在这里先说明一下我的资历：我最熟悉的是\nMCU和DC的电影，但我在我的时代读过几本漫画，肯定不会再看了\n在一些很深的维基兔子洞里阅读各种人物和事件。\n\n这些…最让我头疼的一件事就是","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：拒絕殺死定期殺人的超級惡棍的超級英雄是天真和自私的，不如殺了他們。","the_new_excerpt":"首先，我應該在這裏先說明一下我的資歷：我最熟悉的是\nMCU和DC的電影，但我在我的時代讀過幾本漫畫，肯定不會再看了\n在一些很深的維基兔子洞裏閱讀各種人物和事件。\n\n這些…最讓我頭疼的一件事就是","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-7cb03bf4-f047-56fe-9a3d-1fd9da4b486d","excerpt":"I would just like to say that I am not an economist or a professional political\nphilosopher.
