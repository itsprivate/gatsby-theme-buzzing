His physical health had been deteriorating for a while now and although this could happen to anyone at any age I believe it to be a result of his age and physical decline.</p></li>\n<li><p>My grandma has Alzheimer’s and in the earliest stages of it she ran a stop sign and t-boned another vehicle. I find it unlikely this would have happened had she been retested, because she probably wouldn’t have been declared fit to drive.</p></li>\n<li><p>I was cut off while traveling 45MPH and tboned a car very violently. Both our cars were totaled and although I escaped with minor injuries, the driver (elderly) who cut me off suffered a few broken bones. Both the witnesses who pulled over and the police very quickly determined it was his fault. (Also he tried to sue me after wtf!)</p></li>\n<li><p>I got cut of today by an older gentleman and was about 2 feet away from slamming into his bumper had I not been paying attention, it would’ve been a pretty bad accident. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This incident is what reminded me about how I think we could make the roads safer for all by reevaluating who in our elderly population is still fit to drive.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/o85wbw/cmv_elderly_people_should_have_to_take_another/","title":"CMV: Elderly people should have to take another driving test at a certain age","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"June 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-26T10:30:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-26 10:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"fe5c9d4b-c25b-5178-91b0-9a659c00e243","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/o85wbw/cmv_elderly_people_should_have_to_take_another/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/o85wbw/cmv_elderly_people_should_have_to_take_another/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"karlwheezer54","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/karlwheezer54","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"karlwheezer54","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: 高齢者は一定の年齢になったら、もう一度運転免許試験を受けなければならないべきだ","the_new_excerpt":"他のすべてのドライバーの安全と幸福のために、私は以下のことを行うべきだと思います。\n高齢者がまだ安全に運転できるかどうかを再テスト／再評価することは\nと思います。\n\n何歳になったら再試験を行うべきかはわかりませんが、行うべきだと思います。\n行われるべきだと思います。\n\n私が言いたいのは、それは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：老年人到了一定年龄应该再考一次驾驶证","the_new_excerpt":"为了所有其他司机的安全和福祉，我认为有必要\n重新测试/评估一个年长的人是否仍有能力驾驶\n安全的能力。\n\n我不确定我建议在哪个年龄段进行重新测试，但我相信\n应该这样做。\n\n我的主要观点是，这是个好主意。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：老年人到了一定年齡應該再考一次駕駛證","the_new_excerpt":"爲了所有其他司機的安全和福祉，我認爲有必要\n重新測試/評估一個年長的人是否仍有能力駕駛\n安全的能力。\n\n我不確定我建議在哪個年齡段進行重新測試，但我相信\n應該這樣做。\n\n我的主要觀點是，這是個好主意。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ba16c8c1-18f8-5091-88ea-3c21e49555e6","excerpt":"The other day I posted a cooking video on TikTok, in which I used a knife to\nchop up some ingredients.
