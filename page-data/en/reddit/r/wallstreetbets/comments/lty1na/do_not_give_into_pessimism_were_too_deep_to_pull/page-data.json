Look, I’m not going to make you wrong for asking these types of questions because they are rational questions - but WSB wasn’t founded on rationality - it was founded on YOLOing our children’s college funds away and making memes about it. This is a MOONSHOT; not a sure bet - if you can’t handle the fire get out of the kitchen (aka sub to <a href=\"/r/investing\">r/investing</a> and get a nice safe index fund).</p>\n\n<p>Here are the facts -&gt; They NEED our shares. We are seeing them BLATANTLY use every trick in the book (naked shorts, keeping prices artificially low, blocking trading, etc) - in fact, they’re not even pretending or hiding it anymore. It’s out in the public - anyone who cares to see it can see it. But here’s the thing: despite all their tricks, at the end of the day - they still NEED our shares. At this point, it is a battle of attrition; they can only keep up their charade for so long before they literally have nothing left to short and they have to buy back their shorted positions (side note: I’m a retard and this prob isn’t exactly how it works but close enough so just fucking go with it for now). By holding (think Articuno chilling in cave [Seafoam Island] status) we lose NOTHING. If people keep buying/selling back and forth, it is playing into their hand. They want us to get bored and sell - behind all their dirty tricks, it sums up to them just trying to get us to sell - either through fear or boredom. Do what you got to do - but I am holding until the bitter fucking end.</p>\n\n<p>Tldr; don’t get fatigue/boredom/fear from this - that’s what they want. Take time away and come back fresh. And most importantly - HOLD</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Include specific location of Articuno’s YOLO spot</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: change “short ladder attack” to “keep prices artificially low” herp derp</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lty1na/do_not_give_into_pessimism_were_too_deep_to_pull/","title":"Do NOT give into pessimism -> we’re too DEEP to pull our figurative dick out","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-28T12:37:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-28 12:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lty1na","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lty1na/do_not_give_into_pessimism_were_too_deep_to_pull/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lty1na/do_not_give_into_pessimism_were_too_deep_to_pull/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"chopperdrawlion4","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/chopperdrawlion4","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"chopperdrawlion4","score":2115,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"不要放弃悲观主义 -> 我们太深了，无法拿出我们的象征性的家伙。","the_new_excerpt":"这几天一直看到很多评论，\"这是多大的机率啊？\n实际上是要去工作？\"的问题。听着，我不会让你犯错的\n因为这些问题都是理性的问题--------------------------------。\nWSB不是建立在理性上的--它是建立在YOLOing上的......。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不要放棄悲觀主義 -> 我們太深了，無法拿出我們的象徵性的傢伙。","the_new_excerpt":"這幾天一直看到很多評論，\"這是多大的機率啊？\n實際上是要去工作？\"的問題。聽着，我不會讓你犯錯的\n因爲這些問題都是理性的問題--------------------------------。\nWSB不是建立在理性上的--它是建立在YOLOing上的......。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26292166","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26292166","title":"Actually Portable Executables","date":"February 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"实际上是便携式可执行文件","locale":"zh"},{"title":"實際上是便攜式可執行文件","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lu00ex","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lu00ex/entire_wsb_for_the_past_month_and_upcomming_month/","title":"Entire WSB for the past month (and upcomming month)","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 28, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"上个月(及下个月)的全部WSB内容","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"上個月(及下個月)的全部WSB內容","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lty1na","previousId":"HnPost-26292166","nextId":"RedditPost-lu00ex","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lty1na/do_not_give_into_pessimism_were_too_deep_to_pull/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
