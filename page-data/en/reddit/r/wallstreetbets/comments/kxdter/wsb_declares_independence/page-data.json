That to secure these rights, subs are instituted amongst autists, deriving their reetard strength from the consent of Papas Musk, Karp, Cohen, and Cathy. That whenever Wall Street institutions and other boomers become destructive to these ends, it is the RIGHT of the reetards to alter or destroy them, and to institute new management of the market. </p>\n\n<p>The history of the present market makers and whales is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute TYRANNY over WSB and the autistic everywhere. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Market elites have instituted day trading restrictions, harming our abilities to harness rapid moves of the market to our advantage </li>\n<li>They have infiltrated our sub and kept among us in times of peace, lurkers and FUDders to spread discord </li>\n<li>They have excited boomers against us, and have endeavored to bring upon reetards the merciless SEC savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all autistic savants, from god-king Musk, to the imprisoned Prince Shkreli</li>\n<li>They have declared our sacred meme stocks &quot;casinos&quot; </li>\n<li>They have deliberately lowered price targets when they lose the market advantage to harm retail</li>\n<li>They have limited our abilities to lose our own money, by passing through edict accredited investor limits, putting pressure on Robinhood to halt options approval, and putting a false focus on rIsK mAnAgEmEnT departments</li>\n<li>They have demonized retail traders for the volatility of the market, ignoring the true culprit of monetary debasement and failure to impose stress tests on the market and its participants</li>\n<li>They have imposed taxes on us without our consent</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In every stage of these ruthless and evil actions, we have petitioned Cramer and the hotties on MSNBC for redress in the most humble of terms. Our repeated petitions have only been met with repeated restrictions and condescension. </p>\n\n<p>Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our Boomer &quot;brethren.&quot; We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;learned&quot; government, brokers, and accountants to manipulate the market in favor of the connected and the whales. They did not listen. We warned them of paradigm shifts in AMD, Tesla, and Gamestop. THEY HAVE BEEN DEAF TO THE <em>SCREECHING REEEEES</em> OF AUTISTIC REASON. We must therefore hold them as we hold the whales and market makers, Enemies in trading, in after hours, friends. </p>\n\n<p>Wall street can keep their price targets, their analysts, their rules, and their high frequency trading. They can keep their DCFs, their balance sheets, and their provincial focus on rEvEnUe and p/e ratios. Where WSB is going, we have no use for these archaic and backwards millstones, hung around the neck of wage-slave boomers like heavy stones. </p>\n\n<p>We, therefore, THE UNITED REETARDS AND AUTISTS OF WALL STREET BETS, in general congress, assembled, appealing to the mother of all short squeezes, do, in the name of and by the authority granted by our green dildos, solemnly publish and declare, that these members are, and of right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT TRADERS, that we are absolved from all power and control from the big banks, Wall Street analysts, and boomer talking heads. And that as FREE AND INDEPENDENT REETARDS, we have the power to set our own price targets, have the power to levy war on Melvin Capital, establish tendies, and to do all other things the autistic do. </p>\n\n<p>And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of this sub, we mutually pledge OUR LIVES, OUR DD, AND OUR SACRED TENDIES.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxdter/wsb_declares_independence/","title":"WSB Declares Independence","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-15T18:27:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-15 18:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kxdter","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxdter/wsb_declares_independence/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxdter/wsb_declares_independence/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"justoneword_plastics","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/justoneword_plastics","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"justoneword_plastics","score":1187,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"WSB宣布独立","the_new_excerpt":"在国会，2021年1月14日。\n\n当在人类事件的过程中，有必要让其中的一组人\n商人，以解散将他们与另一个人联系在一起的政治带。\n要想体面地尊重疯狂的钱和其他潮人的意见，就必须做到\n他们应该宣布的原因，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"WSB宣佈獨立","the_new_excerpt":"在國會，2021年1月14日。\n\n當在人類事件的過程中，有必要讓其中的一組人\n商人，以解散將他們與另一個人聯繫在一起的政治帶。\n要想體面地尊重瘋狂的錢和其他潮人的意見，就必須做到\n他們應該宣佈的原因，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kxvhfz","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxvhfz/if_udeepfuckingvalue_can_hold_for_gme_for_a_year/","title":"if u/deepfuckingvalue can hold for GME for a year you can hold for a day, just remember...","date":"January 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果U/deepfuckingvalue能为GME坚持一年，你就能坚持一天，只要记住... ...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果U/deepfuckingvalue能爲GME堅持一年，你就能堅持一天，只要記住... ...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kxwvip","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxwvip/this_is_it_all_in/","title":"THIS IS IT.
