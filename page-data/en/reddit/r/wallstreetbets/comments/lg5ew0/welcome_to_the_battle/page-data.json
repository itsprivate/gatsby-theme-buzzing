And for many, it worked.</p>\n\n<p>No longer is GME on the lips of every mother and father in the beautiful United States.</p>\n\n<p>No longer is it the meme of the week, they want us to move on, forget about the stock, forget our fallen comrades at level 300, 400, 450...</p>\n\n<p>But nay, We will never forget our fallen. I sure as hell haven&#39;t, and I am still holding on like a vice grip.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot manipulate the market by telling our community what WE (ourselves) are doing... yet... Main Street players and Jim Cramer and the likes go on national television to brag about how they manipulated the markets to make profit knowing the SEC won&#39;t do shit. Now his clown ass is desperately trying to do the same to those videos on YT as they have done to GME.  But the internet never forgets.</p>\n\n<p>This is absolute bullshit. The only and safest thing I can do is hold my shares. <sup>\\</sup>you do you, this is only what I am doing and this is not recommended nor is it financial advice.)</p>\n\n<p>BUT I&#39;m holding to the bitter end if it comes to that. I lost 88% so what&#39;s another 12% mean to me?</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I am only writing this to find the ears of my fellow R-tards across the world who grow weak on this battlefield. We are bombarded by days of attrition. But do not waver my lads. This is only the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>My logic is this, I&#39;ve read many DD articles and YouTubes videos (which means I am a pro autist by this point) and from what I&#39;ve gathered, the shorts still have yet to cover and if anything they are doubling down to make even more money from the crash of this stock.</p>\n\n<p>Well hedgies... I SAY:</p>\n\n<p>FUCK YOU AND YOUR MOTHER! KARMA IS A BITCH. TRUST ME. I&#39;VE MET HER. THERE&#39;S NO RUNNING FROM IT. I&#39;VE PAID FOR MY SINS TENFOLD, EVEN WHEN I LAUGHED SAYING ALL OF THAT KARMIC BS WAS  JUST THAT... BS.  But I found out soon enough and I am paying for my wrong doings.</p>\n\n<p>I say this to my enemies.</p>\n\n<p>You know who you are.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;One day. You&#39;ll get a** f***ed so hard by some event, an event that will enrage you like never before, anger will erupt from the pit of your soul, and for a moment... you&#39;ll recall this post, how you were part of the operation that fucked over an entire community of small fish trying to make honest profit while playing by your rules, and you pulled the goddamn plug out of the wall when we started to win.</p>\n\n<p>And you&#39;ll realize... ahhh... fuck you karma... well played.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR - I am holding, you do you, karma will find those who did wrong and they will pay. In the mean time I am still.....holding the line. I know you shorts still haven&#39;t covered.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg5ew0/welcome_to_the_battle/","title":"Welcome to the battle","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T17:14:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 17:14","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lg5ew0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg5ew0/welcome_to_the_battle/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg5ew0/welcome_to_the_battle/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"circlesun22","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/circlesun22","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"circlesun22","score":20835,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"欢迎参加战斗","the_new_excerpt":"对于那些再也听不到GME战歌的人来说，这是因为你们的。\n耳朵鼓被所有的BSBS媒体喂你在过去的几个粉碎\n周。\n\n一直有一个一级杀手行动，目的是让GME消失。And\n对许多人来说，它是有效的。\n\nGME不再是嘴上的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"歡迎參加戰鬥","the_new_excerpt":"對於那些再也聽不到GME戰歌的人來說，這是因爲你們的。\n耳朵鼓被所有的BSBS媒體餵你在過去的幾個粉碎\n周。\n\n一直有一個一級殺手行動，目的是讓GME消失。And\n對許多人來說，它是有效的。\n\nGME不再是嘴上的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lnmd7h","excerpt":"All I see in Reddit, Twitter, and social media is bad advice for the flood of\nnew traders getting into the market right now.
