Ive just got back home from my wageslave job as a stonemason, where we make granite/quartz worktops for people considerably richer than we are. </p>\n\n<p>The story goes as follows: today was just like any other wagecuck day goes boring, monotonous grinding/polishing kitchen tops. At one point there was a really big island worktop, or &quot;countertop&quot; as our American brothers may say. These granite worktops can be really heavy under certain circumstances and today this particular one was and it took two of us to lift it to put a table underneath it to support the granite. </p>\n\n<p>On the way down, laying the granite on the table the third man moved the table too close to mine and my co workers fingers, or lets say hands. Now despite the pain of a couple hundred kg of granite trapping my hands between it and the table, I remained calm. Yet on the other hand my co worker quickly pulled his hands out from underneath as it crushed his fingers essentially tearing his fingers open from the metal table and sharp granite. Nothing major just a few cuts. However yours truly, as I&#39;ve said: remained calm and simply stated my hands were stuck under the granite, so after a bit of panic fellow co-workers managed to lift the heavy granite off and there my fingers were. Intacted. </p>\n\n<p>It was almost as if you could suggest ones hand was made of some material made from intense pressure???</p>\n\n<p>So, the moral of the story is when under pressure the key is to remain calm and keep your eyes on the end goal. Then make sure don&#39;t get distracted and throw yourself to panic as you can very much make the whole situation worse than it actually is. </p>\n\n<p>Anyways imma send a buy order for a thousand shares of GME tomorrow 💎🙏s BAYBEYYY LETS GOOOOOOOOO 🦍🍌🦍🍌🦍🍌🦍🍌🦍🍌🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkigrq/a_true_story_about_diamond_hands/","title":"A True Story About Diamond Hands","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-15T22:41:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-15 22:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lkigrq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkigrq/a_true_story_about_diamond_hands/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkigrq/a_true_story_about_diamond_hands/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Billeard","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Billeard","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Billeard","score":3206,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"鑽石之手的真實故事","the_new_excerpt":"Britbong在这里。\n\n今天我有一个有趣的故事要告诉WSB，我想我的同伴🦍会。\n发现有趣的，如果不是鼓舞人心。我刚刚从我的工资奴隶的工作回到家里，作为一个。\n石匠，我们为更富有的人制作花岗岩/石英台面。\n比我们。\n\n故事是这样的：...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"鑽石之手的真實故事","the_new_excerpt":"Britbong在這裏。\n\n今天我有一個有趣的故事要告訴WSB，我想我的同伴🦍會。\n發現有趣的，如果不是鼓舞人心。我剛剛從我的工資奴隸的工作回到家裏，作爲一個。\n石匠，我們爲更富有的人制作花崗岩/石英檯面。\n比我們。\n\n故事是這樣的：...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ls9xit","excerpt":"So, I'm new to this like most people, right?
