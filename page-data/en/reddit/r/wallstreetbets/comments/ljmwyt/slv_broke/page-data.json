I am curious how this effects price.  Does paper silver finally squeeze or do people flee $SLV?  </p>\n\n<p>Basically what happened: normally $SLV is supposed to cover their positions with physical silver.  They have been “required” to buy positions with physical silver and the fund always acted as a surrogate for the price of physical silver.  Well... recently they updated their prospectus page 7 \n<a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/prospectus/p-ishares-silver-trust-prospectus-12-31.pdf\">https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/prospectus/p-ishares-silver-trust-prospectus-12-31.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>It essentially says that they may not be able to find physical silver to cover positions, finally admitting what has been known for years, that silver supply is way less than demand.  I am sure they saw a potential surge in pricing and are trying to cover themselves from potential lawsuits should “authorized dealers” want to take delivery of their lots of silver from their $SLV position.</p>\n\n<p>This will likely surge the price of physical silver but I am curious does paper silver rocket up also? Does $SLV break? Does paper and physical finally decouple?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljmwyt/slv_broke/","title":"$SLV Broke?","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-14T21:33:04.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-14 21:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ljmwyt","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljmwyt/slv_broke/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljmwyt/slv_broke/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"DrUNC83","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DrUNC83","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DrUNC83","score":2388,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$SLV破产？","the_new_excerpt":"所以看起来上周流入白银后，$SLV终于承认了。\n的骗局，他们一直在运行。我很好奇这对价格有何影响。纸张\n白银最终压制还是人们逃离$SLV？\n\n基本上发生了什么：通常$SLV应该是用他们的仓位来弥补\n物理...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$SLV破產？","the_new_excerpt":"所以看起來上週流入白銀後，$SLV終於承認了。\n的騙局，他們一直在運行。我很好奇這對價格有何影響。紙張\n白銀最終壓制還是人們逃離$SLV？\n\n基本上發生了什麼：通常$SLV應該是用他們的倉位來彌補\n物理...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lrxbvv","excerpt":"Warning: This is a very risky play, trade at your own risk\n\nHello, All!\n\nIf you are not familiar with this saga, feel free to catch up:\n\nFirst Mention\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/]\n\nShort Squeeze Explanation and Initial…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lrxbvv/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_4/","title":"GME short squeeze what comes next part 4","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME空头挤压下一步会发生什么 第四部分","the_new_excerpt":"警告：这是一个非常危险的游戏，交易风险自负。这是一个非常危险的游戏，交易风险自负。\n\n大家好!\n\n如果你对这个传奇不熟悉，欢迎你来补习。\n\n第一次提到\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/]\n\n空头挤压说明和初步...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME空頭擠壓下一步會發生什麼 第四部分","the_new_excerpt":"警告：這是一個非常危險的遊戲，交易風險自負。這是一個非常危險的遊戲，交易風險自負。\n\n大家好!\n\n如果你對這個傳奇不熟悉，歡迎你來補習。\n\n第一次提到\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/]\n\n空頭擠壓說明和初步...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lrs6wg","excerpt":"Let’s face it when this sub went mainstream all of you went full boomer mode and\ncried for the good old days, but now thanks to all the new retards the moon is\nback on the menu boys! 🚀\n\nThey’ve held their own, learned the way and went full retard.
