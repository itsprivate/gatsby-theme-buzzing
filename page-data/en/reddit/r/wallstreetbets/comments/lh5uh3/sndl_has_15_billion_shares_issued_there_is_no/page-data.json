Stop munching on the crayons for a bit and think about it. You are talking about pumping it to 10-50-100-420, and not by any short squeeze, but by sheer pump of money. A situation far beyond what is happening with the other green stocks like TLRY, OGI or APHA. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone heard about the pump and dump before? About bag holders? Anyone?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: For anyone that still is on the fence about this. Don&#39;t let yourselves be taken advantage of. The normal increase for weed stocks up until now after hours has been 5-15%, SNDL has 101% as I am writing this: <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/sndl\">https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/sndl</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tlry\">https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tlry</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ogi?mod=mw_quote_tab\">https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ogi?mod=mw_quote_tab</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha\">https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha</a></p>\n\n<p>Ask yourselves, does the after hours SNDL growth seem legit compared to other weed stocks? Should I buy this overvalued piece of garbage at open or just cancel my order?</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t the weed legalisation wave that SNDL is riding, but the pump and dump wave where there have to be a lot more losers than winners.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh5uh3/sndl_has_15_billion_shares_issued_there_is_no/","title":"SNDL has 1.5 BILLION shares issued.
