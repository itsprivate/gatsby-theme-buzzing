If Ryan Cohen can successfully execute his vision, this leaky vessel will turn into a rocket ship blasting past the moon to the edge of the observable universe.</p>\n\n<p>On November 16, 2020, Ryan Cohen sent a letter to the GameStop&#39;s Board of Directors titled &quot;Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the Ultimate Destination for Gamers&quot;. In it, Ryan Cohen outlined the roadmap for GameStop to pivot and become a technology first company. Let me boil this down for you in simple language for you smooth brain apes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Mission Statement</strong></p>\n\n<p>&quot;GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences [...] the successful and durable players of tomorrow will be technology-first companies that specialize in gaming products, experiences and services.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Landscape</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Explosive Growth in the Gaming Industry\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;The size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;The global gaming market expected to be $174.9 billion this year and reach $217.9 billion by 2023.&quot;</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Valuable Assets\n\n<ul>\n<li>Existing &quot;strong brand&quot; and recent Reddit frenzy is net positive to the brand, increases awareness, and strengthens its base.</li>\n<li>&quot;Large customer base and 55 million PowerUp members.&quot;</li>\n<li>Large retail and physical footprint.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Roadmap</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Evolve into a Technology-first company\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Technology is changing nearly every aspect of the gaming world, ranging from the way gamers shop to how they interact and compete with one another.&quot;</li>\n<li>GameStop will have to &quot;begin building a powerful e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high-touch experience that excites and delights customers.&quot; (Ryan successfully executed this vision with Chewy and he can do it again in gaming)</li>\n<li>GameStop will have to &quot;hire the right talent.&quot; (So far, Ryan has recruited 5 rock stars from Chewy and Amazon to join the team, more on that later).</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Create the Ultimate Gaming Platform\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors.&quot; (Create a marketplace of wanted products and services, i.e. Amazon, Target, App Store)</li>\n<li>Provide and expand &quot;larger gaming catalogs&quot; (Capture all games)</li>\n<li>Create &quot;community experiences&quot; (This could be both physical and digital experiences)</li>\n<li>Provide &quot;streaming services&quot; (New vertical opportunity for content creation, tournaments, and others)</li>\n<li>Support &quot;Esports&quot; (Expanding scene that is not going away)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Transition to Digital\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Industry developments in recent years&quot; include &quot;transition from physical hardware to digital streaming&quot; and the &quot;explosion of mobile.&quot;</li>\n<li>Expand &quot;digital content.&quot; (This needs to be a focus as it&#39;s competing against Steam, Blizzard, App Store, etc)</li>\n<li>Allow &quot;online trade-ins.&quot; (This would be a game changer)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Cut Excessive costs\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Cut its excessive real estate costs&quot; and &quot;identify duplicative, under performing stores and plan to forgo lease renewals.&quot;</li>\n<li>Streamline &quot;Non-core operations in Europe and Australia [...] in order to reduce losses and potentially generate cash.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Near-term increases in cash flow stemming from the console cycle can also help finance the future.&quot;</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Financials</strong></p>\n\n<p>Analysts are valuing GameStop as a traditional brick-and-mortar business. If Ryan can properly execute and transform the company, I believe they can become the Target and Chewy of Gaming with potential verticals of streaming and Esports (not factored into this calculation for now). GameStop makes roughly $8 Billion in Revenue, however it is currently valued at a $3.5B Market Cap as it bleeds cash. Target makes roughly $78B in Revenue with $3.3B in Net Income and a Market Cap of $96 Billion. Chewy makes roughly $4.8B in Revenue, losing money but growing quickly, and is valued at $44B in Market Cap. Target and Chewy are valued at 1.25x to 9x Price to Sales respectively. This equates to $10B to $72B Market Cap transposed to GameStop. Obviously, this is very simplistic and does not consider their balance sheet and other factors, but given these metrics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>GameStop stock price potential is between $143 to $1,032 a share based on a current revenues.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note this is assuming $8B in Revenue. If GameStop can grow revenues, focus on digital to improve margins, and expand within the growing total addressable market, I see potential for higher prices and achieving Target to Chewy-like multiples.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The X Factor</strong></p>\n\n<p>I believe Ryan Cohen was offered to lead GameStop&#39;s transition with significant control and autonomy. Otherwise, I do not believe he would have joined the Board. In his letter, Ryan simply stated that &quot;RC Ventures is not interested in receiving a lone seat on GameStop&#39;s ten-member Board. It is not enticing to become an isolated stockholder advocate on a Board that has overlooked years of digital revenue opportunities and presided over massive value destruction without assuming full accountability.&quot; With the recent additions of two Chewy Executives to the Board of Directors, a new Chief Technology Officer who was the Engineering Lead in Amazon Web Services, a new Customer Care Executive from Chewy, and a new Fulfillment Executive from Amazon, I believe Ryan is executing his vision and revamping the GameStop team.</p>\n\n<p>Notice his hires are from Chewy and Amazon? Ryan Cohen was obsessed with Amazon’s customer centric philosophy and built Chewy to follow that same model. He is hiring digital and e-commerce focused leaders to manage this transformation. Ryan&#39;s customer centric obsession is what allowed Chewy to beat Amazon. If GameStop pivots to digital and follows that same obsession, this will be a great opportunity to win.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I believe Ryan&#39;s vision is the right roadmap for GameStop. Digital e-commerce, streaming, and mobile is the future and Ryan fully acknowledges and embraces that future. GameStop will need to revamp and modernize their website and phone app, but I am sure that will follow in the months ahead. GameStop has the financial and brand assets that should weather this storm, but execution will be key. Ryan owns nearly 10% of GameStop, so he has a vested interest in its success and has much more to lose than my stake.</p>\n\n<p>So degens, I say think with your heart and not with your smooth brain. Strap in and sit tight, this rocket ship may turn into a long journey to Mars. Maybe Papa Elon will be our catalyst.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. If we all buy something from GameStop this quarter we can load this rocket ship ourselves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR; Ryan Cohen is Jesus. Buy and Hold $GME.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj5oyo/why_gamestop_and_ryan_cohen_will_win_dd_no/","title":"Why GameStop and Ryan Cohen will win.
