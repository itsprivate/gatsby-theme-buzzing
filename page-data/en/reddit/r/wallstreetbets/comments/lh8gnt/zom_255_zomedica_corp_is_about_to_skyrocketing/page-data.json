Zomedica’s product portfolio will include <strong>innovative</strong> diagnostics and therapeutics that emphasize patient health and practice health. With a team that includes clinical veterinary professionals, it is Zomedica’s mission to provide veterinarians the opportunity to lower costs, increase productivity, and grow revenue while better serving the animals in their care.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1>Investors</h1>\n\n<p>Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. (US:ZOM) has 45 institutional owners and shareholders that have filed 13D/G or 13F forms with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). These institutions hold a total of <strong>54,381,501 shares</strong>. Largest shareholders include Cambridge Investment Research Advisors, Inc., <strong>Vanguard Group Inc, VTSMX - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares, BlackRock Inc.</strong>, Millennium Management Llc, FSMAX - Fidelity Extended Market Index Fund, Geode Capital Management, Llc, Citadel Advisors Llc, Northern Trust Corp, and Winton Capital Group Ltd.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1>Team</h1>\n\n<p>I checked their employees who are on LinkedIn, I can confirm they are all top notch workers.\n<strong>Newly appointed CEO, Robert Cohen (former Pfizer exec) has taken three different biotech companies from $0.30 to $8.00/share.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1>What is Truforma</h1>\n\n<p>Zomedica&#39;s flagship product, TRUFORMA commercializes March 30th, 2021. TRUFORMA is a point-of-care machine that uses bulk acoustic waves (BAW) technology to detect &amp; diagnose adrenal diseases (in dogs) and thyroid diseases (in dogs and cats). This compact machine delivers results in ~18 mins and carries 70+ global patents.  TRUFORMA does not require pre-market regulatory approval for use with companion animals in the United States.\n<a href=\"https://zomedica.com/truforma-2\">Link</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1>Major competitor</h1>\n\n<p>The current competition is IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ: $IDXX). It&#39;s worth noting that vets currently have to send off samples to these guys and not only is it expensive, but it causes delays in diagnosis (days). TRUFORMA allows for the same tests to take place, on-site at a fraction of the price within 18 minutes. Key members of the IDEXX team have left the company to join Zomedica.\n<a href=\"https://investors.zomedica.com/node/7636/html\">Link.</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1>News and upcoming catalysts</h1>\n\n<p>Zomedica had 2 fantastic weeks, it&#39;s price is rising since they announced truforma will be launched at the end of March.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\nWhen the stock price was at almost $3 they announced a <em>BOUGHT DEAL</em> to rise 173.5 millions dollars at $1.90 per share. Surprisingly this happened just 2 days ago and the price already recovered and is now around $2.55 per share.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\nZomedica announced that the money will be used to speed up the research and launch of new products.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\n As of today Zomedica is <strong>DEBT FREE</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\nThe upcoming financial annual report that will be published at the end of this month, the announcement of a new big potential investor who bought the offered shares, and certain news about Truforma when close to launch could really trigger an unprecedented rise of this stock.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\nBy investing today you could easily have a share worth up to $8 on product launch, or even double digits when they&#39;ll be announcing new incoming products and patents. This is a stock that has common sudden bull runs and a community of retailers who are expecting to hold their shares for years.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\nMore technical data can be found at: <a href=\"https://fintel.io/s/us/zom\">https://fintel.io/s/us/zom</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\nP.S.: This is one of the few stocks that realized gains today. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>Tldr: This company has no flaws, it&#39;s backed by huge investors, has no debt, a lot of cash reserve, and just made a machine that in 18 minutes could tell if your dog/cat is a paper hand or diamond hand 🙌💎</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh8gnt/zom_255_zomedica_corp_is_about_to_skyrocketing/","title":"$ZOM ($2.55) - Zomedica Corp is about to skyrocketing and only a few are realizing it.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-11T10:25:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-11 10:25","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lh8gnt","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh8gnt/zom_255_zomedica_corp_is_about_to_skyrocketing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh8gnt/zom_255_zomedica_corp_is_about_to_skyrocketing/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/lIUiS2oVHyk6uXEqUMGM8N0yk4rGnNdDQUJrzBDwuQQ.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fcecf42d8c7cbf8d3698c45fa3f650193e38320e","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"YahyaJ","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/YahyaJ","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"YahyaJ","score":4613,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$ZOM (2.55美元) - Zomedica公司即将暴涨，只有少数人意识到这一点。","the_new_excerpt":"Tldr在底部。\n\n> 我无意操纵市场，这也是我发这个帖子的原因。\n> 现在。\n> \n> >免责声明：我不提供个人投资建议，也不是一个人。\n> >合格的执业投资顾问。我是一个业余的投资者。我不会\n> > 不能追究责任...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$ZOM (2.55美元) - Zomedica公司即將暴漲，只有少數人意識到這一點。","the_new_excerpt":"Tldr在底部。\n\n> 我無意操縱市場，這也是我發這個帖子的原因。\n> 現在。\n> \n> >免責聲明：我不提供個人投資建議，也不是一個人。\n> >合格的執業投資顧問。我是一個業餘的投資者。我不會\n> > 不能追究責任...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26217821","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26217821","title":"Uighurs: 'Credible case' China carrying out genocide","date":"February 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"维吾尔人。\"可信的案例 \"中国正在进行种族灭绝。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"維吾爾人。\"可信的案例 \"中國正在進行種族滅絕。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26215378","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26215378","title":"Show HN: Ad Network for Sideprojects","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 22, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"显示HN：侧面项目的广告网络。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"顯示HN：側面項目的廣告網絡。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lh8gnt","previousId":"HnPost-26217821","nextId":"HnPost-26215378","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh8gnt/zom_255_zomedica_corp_is_about_to_skyrocketing/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
