You were gambling on 45,000+ people (FT &amp; PT) to loose their jobs as GameStop would slowly go out of business. </p>\n\n<p>But guess what: after Ryan Cohen bought further into GME this will never happen. The team at RC Ventures will make sure of that. And us, we will hold the line and buy further into it until we get rid of all large short positions. GME is not a dead company, it is just getting started.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GameStop is here to stay and will undergo an amazing transformation!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Note: For everyone who is new to this, please be aware that options have very low impact on share prices and that volatility (among many other things) plays a huge factor in your trades.
