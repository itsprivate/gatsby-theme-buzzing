Half of it is plain financial illiteracy, and the other half is inter-generational bashing and fear-mongering. You think it&#39;s been bad thus far? The squeeze hasn&#39;t even really set off yet, can you imagine what happens next week when the stock hits the low triple digits? Eventually to 420.69? End game of 1000$+? Lets recap what has happened so far:</p>\n\n<p><strong>False media narrative #1</strong>: Recent rise of GME is due to sHorT sQuoZe!!!1! </p>\n\n<p><strong>Reality</strong>: GME is an undervalued company &amp; a turnaround story. Investors are finally starting to notice. Short squeeze hasn&#39;t even started yet.</p>\n\n<p><em>January 13th</em> - We had our first breakout to 30$ from the sub-20$ doldrums, the shit-tier level reporting started immediately. The media went balls deep on the short squeeze narrative despite absolutely no evidence that shorts had covered at all. Rather it was just long buyers piling in. For example, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/heavily-shorted-gamestop-soars-most-ever-as-day-traders-circle\">Bloomberg</a> titles their article &quot;GameStop Surges Most Ever in Short Squeeze After Cohen Move&quot; despite quoting Ihor Dusaniwsky stating the opposite in the body of the article.</p>\n\n<p><em>January 14-15th</em> - The stock bounced from the mid to high 30&#39;s. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/01/15/with-138-short-interest-board-change-sends-gamestop-stock-soaring/?sh=21052b426da8\">Forbes</a> reports &quot;What drove up GameStop’s shares was a short-squeeze on steroids.&quot; despite no evidence to support that claim and while quoting Ihor Dusaniwsky saying the actual catalyst was due to stronger holiday sales &amp; board shakeup. </p>\n\n<p><em>January 22nd</em> - GME breaks out yet again - hitting the low 70&#39;s before settling to the 60&#39;s. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/gamestop-soars-nearly-70percent-trading-briefly-halted-amid-epic-short-squeeze.html\">CNBC</a> proceeds to again spread the falsehood about &quot;massive short covering&quot; with absolutely no evidence to back that up. Rather the bump was a result of a gamma squeeze.</p>\n\n<p><strong>False media narrative #2</strong>: Rabid retail investors are victimizing the poor short sellers </p>\n\n<p><strong>Reality</strong>: Short sellers have been conducting illegal naked short selling to drive a company employing tens of thousands to bankruptcy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/gamestop-tug-of-war-gives-reddit-army-a-win-on-record-volatility\">Bloomberg</a> blithly characterizes reddit as an &quot;angry mob&quot; out to attack poor little Citron. Bullshit, an angry mob is what stormed DC on Jan 6th, not a bunch of random individuals that left internet comments you didn&#39;t agree with on your youtube video. No mention of Citron&#39;s far shadier and illicit history. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/gamestop-stock-wall-street-bets-short-squeeze/\">Wired</a> re-urgitates Andrew Left&#39;s baseless claims of being &quot;hacked&quot; and &quot;harrassed by pizza deliveries&quot;. No mention of Citron&#39;s  track-record of making baseless fraud allegation and market manupulation</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/short-bets-pummel-hot-hedge-fund-melvin-capital-11611349217\">WSJ</a> sympathetically mentioned &quot;Many investors have complained about short squeezes that have left them nursing losses.&quot; and then going on to write a gushing biography about Gabe Plotkin. No mention of illegal naked short selling or that Gabe drove GME all the way down to 3$ but was too greedy to lock in his profits.</p>\n\n<p>We, the retail investors, didn&#39;t do shit other than invest into a company that deserves a second chance. The shorts put themselves into a precarious situation through their own greed and illegal naked short selling. The media wants to punch down on the &quot;easy&quot; target: Reddit and WSB. Reddit is scary to boomers who can barely navigate the reddit UI, let alone get an erection. They prefer facebook, where fake news can be piped directly into their senile brains. This mis-information will just get worse from here on out.</p>\n\n<p>We can and should push back, not by some centralized WSB twitter handle, but by what we do best: acting as individual retail investors who advocate for the truth on our soapboxes of choice.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR - Stay strong and 💎🤚. Don’t be afraid to correct the fucking record.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3mpmw/disgraceful_false_media_narrative_about_gme/","title":"Disgraceful & false media narrative about GME","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-24T02:29:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-24 02:29","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l3mpmw","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3mpmw/disgraceful_false_media_narrative_about_gme/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3mpmw/disgraceful_false_media_narrative_about_gme/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/CUPzhFFp7hnkLgvFEYdzLnLbRHkhEm3VaA3EM01RFqU.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=644bea62377f831984368b226c4b9ae194f0d1ee","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"MIA4real","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MIA4real","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"MIA4real","score":4322,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"媒体关于全球环境监测的可耻和虚假的叙述。","the_new_excerpt":"亲爱的弱智和自闭症同胞们，\n\n报道GME传奇的新闻报道水平之低劣，已经是一个他妈的\n耻辱。一半是普通的金融盲，另一半是\n代际间的抨击和恐吓。你觉得到目前为止还不好吗？\n挤压甚至还没有真正掀起... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"媒體關於全球環境監測的可恥和虛假的敘述。","the_new_excerpt":"親愛的弱智和自閉症同胞們，\n\n報道GME傳奇的新聞報道水平之低劣，已經是一個他媽的\n恥辱。一半是普通的金融盲，另一半是\n代際間的抨擊和恐嚇。你覺得到目前爲止還不好嗎？\n擠壓甚至還沒有真正掀起... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-la4z2s","excerpt":"If you see GME falling quickly without volume , this isn't actual selloff of GME\nshares but a tactic of hedge funds to scare you into selling GME.
