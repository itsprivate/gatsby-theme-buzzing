At $10,000 per share GME will only be #8 on the list. At $19,500 it will be #5. At $30,323 it will pass Apple as #1 on the list.

My current position is 828 GME Shares at cost of $96.87 (started at $300+) and 15 $100 call options.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqlae3/gme_exit_strategy_based_on_market_cap_of_top_10/","title":"🚀🚀🚀$GME Exit Strategy based on Market Cap of top 10 companies🚀🚀🚀 Don't be the one that regrets selling too early","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T23:26:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 23:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lqlae3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqlae3/gme_exit_strategy_based_on_market_cap_of_top_10/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqlae3/gme_exit_strategy_based_on_market_cap_of_top_10/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"trey412","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/trey412","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"trey412","score":3022,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"按股价计算的GME市值\n[https://preview.redd.it/b6i1ob43z8j61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc0acc974f4866b0dc9ec5d9b43fc7369aae6db8]\n\n这张图显示了GME进入前十名后的每股价格会是多少？\n公司的市值。以每股10000美元计算，GME只能排在第8位... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"按股價計算的GME市值\n[https://preview.redd.it/b6i1ob43z8j61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc0acc974f4866b0dc9ec5d9b43fc7369aae6db8]\n\n這張圖顯示了GME進入前十名後的每股價格會是多少？\n公司的市值。以每股10000美元計算，GME只能排在第8位... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lya64j","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lya64j/still_holding_fly_with_me_retards/","title":"STILL HOLDING!
