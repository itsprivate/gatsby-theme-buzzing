There&#39;s no such thing as paper hands vs diamond hands. </p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t some kind of socialism or collective we vs them thing. &quot;paper hands&quot; are the people who sell for a profit and leave people bags. Now depending on the situation, they might not leave bags, and people with diamond hands make more money. Sometimes, paper hands are right. </p>\n\n<p>That is because... drum roll... it&#39;s all about supply and demand. This is especially true in options, because they are zero-sum. That means someone will come out a loser. This idea that if we all hOLd tHE LiNE then the stock will keep going up is simply untrue. This isn&#39;t your modern dodge-ball where everyone comes out with participation trophies. Someone will be left with the bag, and that will be you if you don&#39;t start being skeptical and selling the top.</p>\n\n<p>There are people that FOMO&#39;d into weed yesterday. This is the result of people thinking stonks only go up. </p>\n\n<p>Last note: Lots of you. I mean, lots of you entered into the stock market for the FIRST time due to GME. Your first impression is that all hyped stocks will go from $4 to $450. Not at all true. What happened with GME is a once in a decade play. Whether you argue it&#39;s alive or dead isn&#39;t the point. Stop speculating that every stock will be like GME and lock your damn profits!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhor4r/stock_market_101_youre_on_your_own/","title":"Stock Market 101: You're on your own","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-12T03:00:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-12 03:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lhor4r","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhor4r/stock_market_101_youre_on_your_own/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhor4r/stock_market_101_youre_on_your_own/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Jaker_20","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jaker_20","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Jaker_20","score":2642,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"股市101：你是你自己的","the_new_excerpt":"因为这个分论坛已经变成了一边教金融，一边照看孩子，我想\n想让你们明白一些事情。有没有这样的事情，如纸\n手与钻石手。\n\n这不是什么社会主义或集体的我们与他们的事情。\"纸手\"\n是那些为了赚钱而卖的人... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"股市101：你是你自己的","the_new_excerpt":"因爲這個分論壇已經變成了一邊教金融，一邊照看孩子，我想\n想讓你們明白一些事情。有沒有這樣的事情，如紙\n手與鑽石手。\n\n這不是什麼社會主義或集體的我們與他們的事情。\"紙手\"\n是那些爲了賺錢而賣的人... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lpq8vo","excerpt":"Just as the title says.
