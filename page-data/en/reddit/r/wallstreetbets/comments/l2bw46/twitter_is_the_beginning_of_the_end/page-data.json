Especially since we live in an era where anything can offend anyone, calling each other retards and autists... it&#39;s literally a breath of fresh air.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s no other place on earth, where we can talk to each other like this, whilst still having the same level of respect for one another. </p>\n\n<p>Communities like this is fucking precious. It&#39;s like taking a time capsule back to 2000, where calling someone or something &quot;retarded&quot; conveyed a message that wasn&#39;t offensive, but still got a particular point across. Ya know what I mean retards?</p>\n\n<p>The only reason this community can still exist, is because we&#39;re a subreddit. It&#39;s like a niche community inside a larger community. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s safe. We aren&#39;t exposed to the outside world. We belong inside this cave of retardation, and it&#39;s&#39; good for us.</p>\n\n<p>Having this twitter account, puts a face, name and voice to WSB. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not fucking good. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s been like, 48 hours right? There&#39;s already some absolute cringey material on there, where I don&#39;t want to be associated with this. It&#39;s way too public. It&#39;s drawing too much attention to this community, where we already have enough attention. A healthy dose.</p>\n\n<p>A public twitter account is literally not what this sub needs.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2bw46/twitter_is_the_beginning_of_the_end/","title":"Twitter is the beginning of the end","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-22T04:05:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-22 04:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l2bw46","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2bw46/twitter_is_the_beginning_of_the_end/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2bw46/twitter_is_the_beginning_of_the_end/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"benaffleks","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/benaffleks","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"benaffleks","score":8343,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Twitter是结束的开始","the_new_excerpt":"Sup帅哥。\n\n我加入了这个子70万前的子，和你们很多人一样，完全被吸引到了。\n的文化和语言。尤其是我们生活在一个什么都可以的时代\n冒犯了任何人，称对方为弱智和自闭症患者... ... 这简直是一口气。\n的新鲜空气。\n\n没有其他地方... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Twitter是結束的開始","the_new_excerpt":"Sup帥哥。\n\n我加入了這個子70萬前的子，和你們很多人一樣，完全被吸引到了。\n的文化和語言。尤其是我們生活在一個什麼都可以的時代\n冒犯了任何人，稱對方爲弱智和自閉症患者... ... 這簡直是一口氣。\n的新鮮空氣。\n\n沒有其他地方... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25956652","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25956652","title":"Uniwidth Typefaces for Interface Design","date":"January 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"界面设计中的统一宽度字体","locale":"zh"},{"title":"界面設計中的統一寬度字體","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l8ogt7","excerpt":"I know this isn’t about GME & AMC but...\n\nLast week, Chuck Schumer accounced that Marijuana Reform Bills are being merged\nas Congress moves to legalize:\n\nhttps://www.marijuanamoment.net/chuck-schumer-says-marijuana-reform-bills-are-being-merged-as-congress-moves-to-legalize/\n\nThis is massive news,…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l8ogt7/the_green_rush_weedstocks_us_legalization/","title":"The Green Rush - Weedstocks & US Legalization","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 30, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"绿色热潮--杂草股与美国合法化","the_new_excerpt":"我知道这不是关于GME和AMC，但是... ...\n\n上周，查克-舒默宣布，大麻改革法案正在合并。\n由于国会正在采取行动，使其合法化。\n\nhttps://www.marijuanamoment.net/chuck-schumer-says-marijuana-reform-bills-are-being-merged-as-congress-moves-to-legalize/\n\n这是一个巨大的新闻，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"綠色熱潮--雜草股與美國合法化","the_new_excerpt":"我知道這不是關於GME和AMC，但是... ...\n\n上週，查克-舒默宣佈，大麻改革法案正在合併。\n由於國會正在採取行動，使其合法化。\n\nhttps://www.marijuanamoment.net/chuck-schumer-says-marijuana-reform-bills-are-being-merged-as-congress-moves-to-legalize/\n\n這是一個巨大的新聞，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l2bw46","previousId":"HnPost-25956652","nextId":"RedditPost-l8ogt7","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2bw46/twitter_is_the_beginning_of_the_end/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
