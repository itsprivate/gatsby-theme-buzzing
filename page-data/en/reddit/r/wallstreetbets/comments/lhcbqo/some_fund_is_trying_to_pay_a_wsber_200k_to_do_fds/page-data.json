I think we should all apply with a top line comment, and then make fun of the applicants in the thread.</p>\n\n<p>Also, <a href=\"/u/dhsmatt2\">/u/dhsmatt2</a> :  your job sucks.   Apply for this one.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>The Posting (my comments added in parentheses)</h1>\n\n<p><strong>About Cindicator Capital</strong></p>\n\n<p>Launched in 2019, Cindicator Capital is the first quantitative fund powered by Hybrid Intelligence <strong><em>(makes you wonder how long it took to come up with that name)</em></strong>. The fund&#39;s set of uncorrelated strategies adapts to different regimes in the digital asset market, aiming to generate returns in bullish, bearish, and sideways trends.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, we’ve built Macro Sentiment Indicators, a tool that tracks the moods of market participants to predict weekly movements of the S&amp;P 500 and other instruments with 70% accuracy <strong><em>(So, they&#39;ve predicted the market with 70% accuracy since 2019... I can do better than that:  Stonks only go up.   That is more accurate than 70% since 2019)</em></strong>. Now we’re looking for someone to strengthen our trading team and help us build new products. </p>\n\n<p><strong>About this role</strong> </p>\n\n<p>As a Sentiment Trader, you’ll be the voice of the millions of traders. With a combination of our qualitative approach to measuring market moods and your ‘street-smarts’, you’ll actively manage our internal multi-million corporate treasury <strong>(so, this job will last you two weeks)</strong>. Then you’ll turn the resulting insights into new features, products, and trading strategies for clients. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What you should have:</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>3+ years of active trading experience with both impressive gains and losses; <strong>(we only do one or the other here)</strong></li>\n<li>In-depth knowledge of options greeks and indicators; <strong>(this means that they are a constant frat party)</strong></li>\n<li>A solid grasp of probability even if you don’t know the theory (i.e. be good at poker); <strong>(they were so proud of themselves for this line)</strong></li>\n<li>An active member of <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">r/wallstreetbets</a> with an account age of &gt;365 days and karma of over 1000; <strong>(no prayer threads.   They don&#39;t need to take your energy.   They just want FD&#39;s.)</strong></li>\n<li>Clear, unbiased thinking that defies authority;  <strong>(Don&#39;t worry about the first part.   Defying authority.   Check.)</strong></li>\n<li>A refined taste for memes and a sense of humour.  <strong>(The fellow kids meme was made for this one)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jmsupz3ftrg61.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e42e666d8bc1598c1fbaf164dea2d147b162779\">https://preview.redd.it/jmsupz3ftrg61.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e42e666d8bc1598c1fbaf164dea2d147b162779</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Important: NO higher education in economics or finance. Alternatively, prove that you’re free from any mainstream financial brainwash.   <strong>(Numbers are meaningless in this market.   We agree.)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>What you will be doing:</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Combining our proprietary Macro Sentiment Indicators with your own research to formulate trading ideas for quant strategies;  <strong>(Don&#39;t tell these guys about our secret method of using chickens)</strong></li>\n<li>Spending most of your time on Reddit, Discord chats, and Twitter to feel the pulse of the tens of millions of retail traders;  <strong>(Not sure how this is going to be different)</strong></li>\n<li>Opening six-figures OTM options trades with the firm’s own capital;  <strong>(THIS we can do.  WAY OTM.)</strong></li>\n<li>Trying your best to prevent our risk management from having a heart attack.  <strong>(Good thing they get subsidized medications too)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$200,000 base salary and a performance-based bonus (30% of the P&amp;L);</li>\n<li>Remote, flexible working hours;</li>\n<li>Medical and dental insurance;</li>\n<li>50% subsidy for psychotherapy and related medications; </li>\n<li>After the pandemic is over: parties in Seoul, Korea and St Petersburg, Russia;</li>\n<li>Optional: a place at a Burning Man camp.  <strong>(For when we burn it all down with GME)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As part of your application, please include one trading idea that uses Macro Sentiment Indicators (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/39Sfa5O\">https://bit.ly/39Sfa5O</a>).  <strong>(We&#39;ve got to split up these applications.   Some of you can use the chicken method and the others can use the dog method).</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Good luck to all of you and whoever wins needs to post all trades AHEAD OF TIME.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhcbqo/some_fund_is_trying_to_pay_a_wsber_200k_to_do_fds/","title":"Some fund is trying to pay a WSBer $200k+ to do FD's and they are too retarded to post it here.
