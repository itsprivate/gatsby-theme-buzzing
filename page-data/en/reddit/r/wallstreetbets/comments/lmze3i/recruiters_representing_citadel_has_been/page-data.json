Large scale data mining can find trends for rising stonks on this sub before we even can. The hedgefunds are paying ridiculous amounts of money for developers to make it so that retail investors continue to have less power and access to less information than them.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, we have enough programmers on this sub we could (and should) get an open source competing team going to democratize this information. I&#39;m looking into it now, but unfortunately I have very little experience data mining/analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Reworded a sentence for clarity, missed the ninja edit grace period by a smidge</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Within 30 minutes of posting this, I have enough offers for help to get this started. I&#39;ve never contributed to an open source project before much less owned one, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be in good hands. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/claireballoon/wallstreetbets\">I&#39;ve gone ahead and made a repo for you to follow, although nothing exists yet.</a> I humbly ask that you not overwhelm me as I&#39;m figuring all this out. I&#39;m getting a discord organized first, feel free to DM me with your background and a request to be added. Once there&#39;s at least some form of moderation in place for that, I&#39;ll post that publicly and we can all go from there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> Changed the imgur link to be one uploaded anonymously for privacy concerns, the images themselves have not been changed. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you to the 100+ people who have DM&#39;d me with offers for help--it will take me a long time to be able to sort through all of these. Please stay patient. &lt;3</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 4:  If possible, please send me a reddit DM rather than a chat.</strong> For some reason, I am no longer able to send chats. Not sure if I&#39;m being rate limited or just a bug.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to everyone who has shared similar projects that already exist. After I finish adding all interested collaborators, the next steps will be brainstorming and identifying what our objectives are--what we want to accomplish, what is reasonable, what our goals are. This will include incorporating or collaborating with what already exists.</p>\n\n<p>For the skeptics out there--I understand your doubts, but I am endeavoring to do whatever I can with the momentum this post has gotten. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 6:</strong> If you have legal experience and/or are a lawyer that can help us make sure we&#39;re not breaking the law, we need that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 7:</strong> I am still going through the DMs to those who have already sent them. For those now seeing this post please fill out this <a href=\"https://forms.gle/kq9LdjagEhoDz4X5A\">google form</a> rather than sending me a DM.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmze3i/recruiters_representing_citadel_has_been/","title":"Recruiters representing Citadel has been aggressively attempting to recruit me as a software developer since mid November, offering to pay $100-150k more than the median for early/mid career developers","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-19T03:15:38.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-19 03:15","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lmze3i","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmze3i/recruiters_representing_citadel_has_been/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmze3i/recruiters_representing_citadel_has_been/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/mY399c0s9y2canEofx_VC0G3qJBDaxRocc-MXkRXur8.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f7a5cce517226b6f9f66b6174f527a3f15e22eb7","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"claireupvotes","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/claireupvotes","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"claireupvotes","score":15722,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"从11月中旬开始，代表Citadel的招聘人员就一直在积极尝试招聘我做软件开发人员，开出的工资比早期/中期职业开发人员的中位数高出10-15万。","the_new_excerpt":"代表Citadel的招聘人员一直在积极地试图招聘我。\n自11月中旬以来，作为一名软件开发人员。\n\n我认为这真的很有趣，鉴于今天的听证会，梅尔文。\n首都CIO谈到，他们已经有一个团队正在为数据而建立。\n采矿/科学，以...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"從11月中旬開始，代表Citadel的招聘人員就一直在積極嘗試招聘我做軟件開發人員，開出的工資比早期/中期職業開發人員的中位數高出10-15萬。","the_new_excerpt":"代表Citadel的招聘人員一直在積極地試圖招聘我。\n自11月中旬以來，作爲一名軟件開發人員。\n\n我認爲這真的很有趣，鑑於今天的聽證會，梅爾文。\n首都CIO談到，他們已經有一個團隊正在爲數據而建立。\n採礦/科學，以...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lv0llo","excerpt":"As many of you rightfully complain, Buffett has failed to find elephant deals\nfor many years.
