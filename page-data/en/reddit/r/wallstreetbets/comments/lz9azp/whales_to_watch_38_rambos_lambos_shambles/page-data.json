These are scheduled company events, meetings, and conference presentations outside of earnings reports.  I cross-reference these with intriguing Unusual Options Acvitivity to come up with a variety of picks of various confidence levels</em></p>\n\n<p><em>For my UOA I prefer Unusual Whales, and they’ve been cool enough to give their blessing to repost these screenshots. I use Barchart/TOS for options flow</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Long as usual, skip to picks or TLDR if need be</em></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>Welcome back to the casino. Review of last week and lessons learned.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Last Week’s Multibagger (s)</strong>: <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Aw4DhDW.jpg\">EPD was a 300% play with entries and exits timed right</a>, <strong>DOCU</strong> RAMBO was a day 1 hit if you sold after the event pop  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Last Week’s Mid-week multi-bagger</strong>: began pumping <strong>OPEC+ &amp; XOM RAMBO</strong> in the updates mid-week.  That flow was correct, and boy oh boy was oil a gusher. XOM COP etc printed. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Last Week’s Duds</strong>: Literally everything else that was in tech.  Just brutal. I failed there thinking the tech dump was over and got tricked by the Monday dead cat. </p>\n\n<p>The real meat is in the losses, so let’s see what we learned in the tech breadline and how we’ll apply it this week. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Lesson Learned 1</strong>: In volatile times when the trend is against the sector, <strong>we want to stick with RAMBO and UOA that is company-specific (Investor/Analyst Day) rather than chasing conferences and meetings</strong>.  If tech is dumping its brains out, for example, the CFO of CRM giving a speech at a random conference has the efficacy of tears in the rain.  Very tough but very useful lesson, and sorry to those who got completely rinsed on those lesser tech RAMBOs.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Lesson Learned 2</strong>: When it comes to sectors, the <strong>trend is your friend</strong>.  The news predictions coming out regarding OPEC+ were doomsday, <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/6HIWA7X/\">but I kept seeing large bets placed on oil giants from Monday to Wednesday</a>.  I decided to trust where the money was going, not what the news was predicting.  This, coupled with my basic research knowledge from last month that the Saudi’s have truly embraced the pump, was enough to zig when the news zagged.  <strong>There are a million reasons why news leaks could lead you to go one way, but around here we ALWAYS watch where the money, not where the manipulated headlines go.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE THE DATES</strong>. Don’t buy calls Monday for an event listed Friday then hit me with the surprised Pikachu face if it’s red through Tuesday lol </p>\n\n<p>With another week under our belt and those lessons learned in mind, let’s get to work.  </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>  \n<strong>CONFIDENCE SYSTEM</strong>: I’m going to split this week’s picks up into high confidence near term plays, and further out plays.    </p>\n\n<p><strong>Plays that have U.O.A. (unusual options activity), are company-specific, and near-dated</strong> will get 3 rockets.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Plays that have two of those factors get two rockets</strong>, and I will specify what they have.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Plays that have one of those factors or,  more likely, are further out will be placed in our “watch bin” and get a sands of time emoji</strong>.  This indicates these are plays that will be benificial, but you really gotta wait for entry.  </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>Tier 1: Company-sponsored events this week with UOA</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/dJNmDYU.jpg\">DKNG</a>🚀  🚀 🚀</p>\n\n<p>Classic post-ER setup we spoke about in last week&#39;s DD.  DKNG ER was Friday, February 26th.  On March 3rd, <a href=\"https://draftkings.gcs-web.com/events/event-details/draftkings-investor-day/\">DKNG announced an investor day being held this coming Tuesday, the 9th</a></p>\n\n<p>Remember, we identifed this pattern as being consistent with <strong>news saved from ER, presented a few weeks later as insurance against the current volatile earnings environment</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Guess what else happened on March 3rd?  <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/J5YqFz0.jpg\">A whale bet came through for 85c 3/19</a> while the underlying was a mere 66.68 🤔 </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/mf4PS3O.jpg\">GE</a>🚀  🚀 🚀</p>\n\n<p>The boomers are back!  GE has been on a little run, and tucked between last ER at the end of January, and their upcoming ER in May, <a href=\"https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/2n7ucb9j\">I spy a &quot;2021 GE Investor Outlook&quot; coming this Tuesday</a>, March 10th.  Wow, what a weird way to spell &quot;Scheduled Pump&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>The whale betting has begun.  <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/Ep5noQR/\">On Wednesday somebody put in a 4/16 16c order, and on Thursday somebody went with a 3/12 15c</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The event is at <strong>8:00 AM EST time on Wednesday, so grab your lottery ticket at the close on Tuesday if you’re playing this</strong>.  Looks like another early-ass morning here in California for yours truly.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Z5tJcXA.jpg\">DIS</a> 🚀 🚀 🚀 (but worth a hedge)</p>\n\n<p>Mouse in the house. Disney plus Disney plus blah blah blah. If i hear one more thing about stellar DIS+ numbers I&#39;m going to hurl, so looks like I&#39;m going to hurl on <a href=\"https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-companys-2021-annual-meeting-of-shareholders/\">Tuesday because the mouse has their 2021 Annual Meeting of the Shareholders coming</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Could explain why <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/T7TndP2.jpg\">this 222.5c was put through THIS Wednesday, 3/3</a>.  I have seen some bearish put hedges sneak through, too, so maybe sell a call/buy a poot against the position or play the strike tight, in case they give an insanely bleak outlook related to theme parks that the news runs with.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: Being that I live in Los Angeles, I will personally drive over to their Burbank studios and punch mouse in the face if this doesn’t play out.</em></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>Tier 2: Meeting and conference presentations the next two weeks with intriguing UOA</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/RgAE1hG.jpg\">SQ</a>🚀 🚀 </p>\n\n<p>OTM call activity and speaking at the Wolfe FinTech Forum on 3/9. <a href=\"https://investors.squareup.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/Wolfe-FinTech-Forum/default.aspx\">https://investors.squareup.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/Wolfe-FinTech-Forum/default.aspx</a></p>\n\n<p>Tier 2 because it&#39;s not SQ&#39;s event, but instead a conference.  I <strong>almost snuk this into Tier 1 against the rules, and here’s why</strong>: <a href=\"https://kvia.com/news/business-technology/2021/03/02/square-launches-an-in-house-bank-as-fintech-competition-heats-up/\">SQ quietly created an in-house bank this week</a> in ADDITION to their acquisition of TIDAL.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, <strong>it is a FinTech conference where SQ will be speaking RIGHT AFTER making a humongous FinTech move</strong>.  Between SQ and TWTR, Jack is absolutely dripping in pump rn and I think the party keeps going here. </p>\n\n<p>PS- I&#39;ve had Tidal ever since it was a free one year offering on my cell phone plan.  Everyone hates on it but it&#39;s legit!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/xyyHFHU.jpg\">EBAY</a>🚀 🚀 </p>\n\n<p>Speaking at the <a href=\"https://investors.ebayinc.com/events/default.aspx\">Bank of America Consumer and Retail Conference on Tuesday</a></p>\n\n<p>Tier 2 as it&#39;s not their specific event.  Sounds like an absolute snoozefest, BUT we&#39;ve got intriguing call buys, with <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Soipwy9.jpg\">not only a May expiration placed thursday, but a 3/12 OTM call placed on Friday.</a></p>\n\n<p>EBAY bout to be YEETBAY.  I&#39;m curious to see what comes out on this one, and cut it quick if nothing pops off.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/TbdPZfi.jpg\">OCGN</a>🚀 🚀 </p>\n\n<p>Breaking my own rules and sneaking this later dated play into T2.  <a href=\"https://ir.ocugen.com/events/event-details/oppenheimer-annual-healthcare-conference\">On March 16th, they are presenting at Oppenheimer Annual Healthcare Conference (big boy shit)</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/0XnvtYu.jpg\">Somebody placed a 3/19 15c bet on it</a>.  The underlying was 11 dollars at the time.  Seems pretty...pretty good.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>*<em>Grab bag: Intriguing opportunities we are still waiting for UOA confirmation on ⌛️ *</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>SONOS</strong> with an <a href=\"https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/investor-news/latest-news/2021/Sonos-to-Host-Virtual-Investor-Event-on-March-9-2021/default.aspx\">Investor Day including Q &amp; A on March 9th</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>ETSY</strong> post-ER with a <a href=\"https://investors.etsy.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx\">smattering of conference and meetings pumps on the 10th, 11th, 26th, and 24th</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>AZN</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.astrazeneca.com/investor-relations/events.html\">multiple pumps scheduled each of the next two months</a> and is the busiest events calendar I&#39;ve seen thus far.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Qw8UtFT.jpg\">Interesting that the two recent whale bets were both for 5/21</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>CRSR</strong> with <a href=\"https://ir.corsair.com/events-presentations\">one conference on the 11th and two on the 16th</a> </p>\n\n<p><strong>CP</strong> got a very intruiging tip on their recent performance.  JP Morgan industrial conference, presenting March 15th.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>🐻 <strong>A quick market note on the great being the enemy of the good</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Looks like stimmy is passing.  In 2020 this would be a SPY pump, but <strong>recent treasuries activity indicates that the market seems to be reacting to good news by trying to see into the future</strong>.  As more and more bullish news for the actual ECONOMY rather than the MARKET comes out, it has the potential to be bearish, as MMs move money in anticipation of rising interest rates, yields, and the eventual Fed rates increase and Quantitative Easing tapering )even though Powell swears not to.)</p>\n\n<p>So, ya know, be careful out there. <strong>Wait for index direction to sort in the morning before diving all in</strong>. I would say grab some VXX but it’s a manipulated piece of shit that I hate right now. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>GE DIS and DKNG</strong> have very interesting pump events coming with the UOA to indicate somebody out there is betting it will pay off. 🚀 🚀 🚀 </p>\n\n<p><strong>SQ EBAY and OCGN</strong> have interesting speaking engagements with intriguing UOA, but they are not company-specific events (conferences, meetings) 🚀 🚀 </p>\n\n<p>There are several interesting plays in the coming weeks. ⌛️ </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><em>Inbox always open.  Keep sending me events, it does not annoy me at all. Have fun out there.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz9azp/whales_to_watch_38_rambos_lambos_shambles/","title":"🐳 🪓 Whales to Watch 3/8: RAMBOs, LAMBOS, SHAMBLES","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-07T15:27:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-07 15:27","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lz9azp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz9azp/whales_to_watch_38_rambos_lambos_shambles/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz9azp/whales_to_watch_38_rambos_lambos_shambles/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/PBTSC--bPHmGbedE3LcnwkQgQg9wiA6rPf7wnh8de8Q.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6982c35db47b4a674e4e5a63e241f20a04d8348c","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"AllDatDalton","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/AllDatDalton","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"AllDatDalton","score":1356,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"🐳 🪓 鲸鱼观察 3/8: RAMBOs, LAMBOS, SHAMBLES","the_new_excerpt":"R.A.M.B.O.就是我所说的关系和会议购买机会。这些机会是\n预定的公司活动、会议和会议演讲以外的活动。\n盈利报告。我将这些与有趣的 \"不寻常期权 \"进行交叉参考。\nAcvitivity要拿出各种选题的各种信心...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"🐳 🪓 鯨魚觀察 3/8: RAMBOs, LAMBOS, SHAMBLES","the_new_excerpt":"R.A.M.B.O.就是我所說的關係和會議購買機會。這些機會是\n預定的公司活動、會議和會議演講以外的活動。\n盈利報告。我將這些與有趣的 \"不尋常期權 \"進行交叉參考。\nAcvitivity要拿出各種選題的各種信心...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m7th68","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7th68/hodling_and_watching_the_world_burn/","title":"HODLING AND WATCHING THE WORLD BURN","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"HODLING和看着世界被焚烧","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"HODLING和看着世界被焚燒","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m7x5ve","excerpt":"I repeat, DO NOT pay for the Motley Fool stock advisor programs..you are much\nbetter on your own..It is very funny which stocks they recommend+they usually\nrecommend when it s at the peak...why am I writing this?
