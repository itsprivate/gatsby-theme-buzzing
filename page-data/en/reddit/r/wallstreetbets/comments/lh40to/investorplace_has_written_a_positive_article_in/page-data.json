In the past two weeks, we&#39;ve been accused of being an echo chamber and supporting confirmation bias. We&#39;ve even been called a delusional loser cult by our many haters who are desperate for us to sell our GME shares. Therefore reading this article from a respected objective source like Investor Place really made me feel good after a long time.</p>\n\n<p>For those who don&#39;t want to read the entire article, the author writes a warning to the short sellers. He writes that short-sellers/bears are used to speculators who invest in stocks for profit. Short-sellers know how to deal with these speculators because speculators scare easy and will usually cut their losses, sell, and invest in different stock. However, the author states that short sellers should be very worried because these retail investors from <a href=\"/r/WSB\">r/WSB</a> are of a different breed. Most are willing to just buy and hold stock. Just buy and hold. The retail investors can hold far longer than the short-sellers/bears would like. Furthermore, according to the author, if these retail investors continue to buy and hold, a short squeeze is possible.</p>\n\n<p>Please read this article and allow hope to fill your body. Damn right we&#39;re a different breed! Our tenacity and patience knows no bounds! We will buy and hold until we win! Either through a short squeeze or through the company turning successful under Ryan Cohen&#39;s leadership. Either way, we win! This is why we&#39;re diamond hand apes! </p>\n\n<p>Also to the haters and OGs who keep saying that they&#39;re tired of GME threads/posts, I have a message for you. We&#39;re not going anywhere. Whine and bitch all you want but you best get used to ignoring our threads. The first share I bought in my entire life has been these GME shares. I invested my entire life savings in BANG gang! I&#39;m down 80% on my investments and I will not cut my losses. For one thing, if I cut my losses, I won&#39;t have money to invest in any other stocks. Second, my mama didn&#39;t raise no quitter! To the diamond hand gang, don&#39;t lose hope!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh40to/investorplace_has_written_a_positive_article_in/","title":"InvestorPlace has written a positive article in support of GME Diamond Hands Apes!","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T23:35:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 23:35","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lh40to","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh40to/investorplace_has_written_a_positive_article_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh40to/investorplace_has_written_a_positive_article_in/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/2-XGP6WJpEOiAQgZZtWqJG6nyKA6cav5NIakmgkIREQ.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6dff31690d7a5f807d35f1f3e12919572f38e7a6","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"BraetonWilson","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BraetonWilson","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"BraetonWilson","score":34341,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"投资者报》撰文积极支持GME钻石手猿!","the_new_excerpt":"https://investorplace.com/2021/02/gme-stock-gamestop-short-squeeze-continues/\n\n作为一个GME股票的持有者（同时也是AMC、BB和NOK股票的持有者），读到这里，你会发现，你是一个很好的选择。\n的文章给了我很多希望。在过去的两个星期里，我们被指责为\n是一个回声室 和支持确认偏见。我们甚至已经...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"投資者報》撰文積極支持GME鑽石手猿!","the_new_excerpt":"https://investorplace.com/2021/02/gme-stock-gamestop-short-squeeze-continues/\n\n作爲一個GME股票的持有者（同時也是AMC、BB和NOK股票的持有者），讀到這裏，你會發現，你是一個很好的選擇。\n的文章給了我很多希望。在過去的兩個星期裏，我們被指責爲\n是一個回聲室 和支持確認偏見。我們甚至已經...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-loyvbl","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loyvbl/we_just_like_the_stock/","title":"💎 WE JUST LIKE THE STOCK 🙌🏼","date":"February 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"💎 WE JUST LIKE THE STOCK 🙌🏼","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"💎 WE JUST LIKE THE STOCK 🙌🏼","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lozsks","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lozsks/sorry_for_the_shitty_screenshot_but_thanks_for/","title":"Sorry for the shitty screenshot but thanks for the help paying off my student loans this year!
