I haven’t seen anything like it.</p>\n\n<p>Last week was exhausting (and I was mainly just watching...)</p>\n\n<p>No doubt people are drained from stress, flying, falling, fear, ecstasy. This is especially true if you’ve partaken in drugs, alcohol, sex. No judgement, I just want you to do your laundry after the ecstasy to prepare for whatever is to come. Blood or angels. </p>\n\n<p>Many no doubt have wins and losses, and there is a huge amount of depletion that occurs inside of the brain and body after serious events. People need to refuel. It will help sharpen you for the coming week. </p>\n\n<p>Tips: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Go for a walk/stroll outside. Smell anything out there. </p></li>\n<li><p>Eat a balanced diet today. Load up on veggies and fruits. Drink a lot of water. A lot.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make dinner with your family. </p></li>\n<li><p>Crack jokes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Take a cold shower (“Wim Hof method”).</p></li>\n<li><p>Express and feel gratitude, starting with basic things like the fact you have eyes and can see. Try for 3 things, even if you are down. </p></li>\n<li><p>Search your maps for a float therapy (“isolation tank”, “floating”, “sensory deprivation”). This usually costs $70 and is a pinnacle experience. Trust me. I’ve been floating for years and you bet your ass I went today.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you can’t do the above, meditate.</p></li>\n<li><p>Read a book</p></li>\n<li><p>Draw</p></li>\n<li><p>Pray <a href=\"/u/SweetEmbraceableYou\">u/SweetEmbraceableYou</a></p></li>\n<li><p>If you have trouble sleeping: Chamomile tea, and Valerian Root or Melatonin <a href=\"/u/2ticketstotendytown\">u/2ticketstotendytown</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Yoga <a href=\"/u/Goin_off\">u/Goin_off</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Wear comfy socks.

It has no boundaries. You need to have a fresh mind and body to take on the volatility and pure Gs of a rocket ship. It is abso-fucking-lutely terrifying for some people. Whatever plays you’re making, please go into the coming week with a clear mind. I especially recommend floating in a sensory deprivation tank. </p>\n\n<p>Share your ideas in the comments, and when inspired, go do that thing. Please. For yourself. 👊</p>\n\n<p>God speed, retards 🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3ufji/psa_mental_health_and_you_community_edition/","title":"PSA: Mental Health and YOU (Community edition)","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-24T17:20:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-24 17:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l3ufji","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3ufji/psa_mental_health_and_you_community_edition/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3ufji/psa_mental_health_and_you_community_edition/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Macnamera","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Macnamera","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Macnamera","score":1646,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"公益广告：心理健康与你(社区版)","the_new_excerpt":"我希望这个帖子是合适的。我还没有见过这样的事情。\n\n上周真是累死人了（我主要就是看......）。\n\n毫无疑问，人们因为压力、飞翔、坠落、恐惧、狂喜而疲惫不堪。这就是\n尤其是当你参与了毒品，酒精，性行为的时候。没有判断，我只是\n要你...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"公益廣告：心理健康與你(社區版)","the_new_excerpt":"我希望這個帖子是合適的。我還沒有見過這樣的事情。\n\n上週真是累死人了（我主要就是看......）。\n\n毫無疑問，人們因爲壓力、飛翔、墜落、恐懼、狂喜而疲憊不堪。這就是\n尤其是當你參與了毒品，酒精，性行爲的時候。沒有判斷，我只是\n要你...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-la2trf","excerpt":"I have been mulling over getting a position into Taiwan Semiconductor\nManufacturing Co for the past week.
