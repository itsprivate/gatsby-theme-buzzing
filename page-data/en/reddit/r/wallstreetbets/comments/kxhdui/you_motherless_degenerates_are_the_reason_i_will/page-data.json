Instead of engaging in my God given right to degeneracy and moral depravity as a male in the 18-34 demographic, I&#39;ve subjected myself to getting every orifice blasted with medical knowledge in the hopes that when one of you shitheads decides to eat lego for the second time because the first time didn&#39;t go so badly, I&#39;ll be able to snatch your miserable life from the brink of oblivion when that shit homes in on your right mainstem bronchus. You&#39;re fucking welcome.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve always held a fascination for veterinary medicine as well, which is what brought me to this sub in the first place. After deciphering the braying of the livestock that roam these parts, I found that some of the shit you animals have been throwing at the wall actually sticks. Instead of graduating med school with a student loan shaped hole in my ass, I&#39;ll actually come out ahead of the fucking game. I won&#39;t be worrying about how to pay off my shit as a minimum wage bitch over the next five years, and instead I can spend my attention on what really matters: gastric pumping the tendies overdose from your bloated corpse of a body while moving in on all your wives.</p>\n\n<p>The combination of disability and accomplishment of this sub is truly remarkable, and you&#39;ll all only grow in notoriety. You&#39;ve proven that neuro-syphillis is no reason not to succeed, and I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to dish out penicillin shots to you beautiful pox ridden bastards. Thank you for being so generous in sharing your degeneracy.</p>\n\n<p>Positions cuz I ain&#39;t no bitch:</p>\n\n<p>Meme parade of shares in TSLA @ 300 pre-split with some topping up along the way, GME @ 15.1, BB @ 6.6, PLTR @ 20.4, and some other random bullshit.
