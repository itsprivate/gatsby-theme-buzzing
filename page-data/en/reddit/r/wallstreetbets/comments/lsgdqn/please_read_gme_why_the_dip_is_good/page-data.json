TL/DR at the bottom for the most autist...</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here is why- </p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>We are still up huge from the close of yesterday</strong> and have seen a solid ground at the 106 range. This establishes a floor, i.e. the minimum amount of money the stock can go if paper hands sell.</p>\n\n<p>2) I have read multiple articles claiming <strong>that Short Sellers just on Wednesday lost a total of 818 million.</strong> Why is this important you may ask?? Well simply put for you fellow atuists, with these HF down nearly a billion in one day, they can&#39;t continue the squeeze because they have no capital to buy the calls back. <strong>So this might leave us with no large increases until Monday until capital can be raised to cover.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>3) We know from the past, that without capital <strong>A) there can&#39;t be any short latter attacks B) the HF will be forced to pay high interest on these positions if they don&#39;t cover them. C) there will be a continuation of a squeeze if we hold.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>IT won&#39;t LET ME POST THE LINK- just look it up it&#39;s the first article.</p>\n\n<p>4) <strong>Other shorted stocks have a good chance at rising too.</strong> Rember GME is the big whale while other shorts like AMC, NOK, and BB are more like fishes (still valuable but not like the whale). So while HF gathers capital to cover shorts on GME, <strong>they will have to pay BIG BIG BIG bucks on interest with the other smaller stocks.</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>TL/DR: don&#39;t panic because you see a drop right now, there is a good chance that it is because of limited capital from HF because of Wednesday&#39;s crash, leading to no money to cover shorts.</strong> This means HF will be forced to pay interest on the positions they still have and will lead to a bigger squeeze in the next few days. HOLD THE LINE.</p>\n\n<p>I am not an adviser, I just like the stock ;)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsgdqn/please_read_gme_why_the_dip_is_good/","title":"PLEASE READ!!!!
