You can lose money here?!&quot; Yes dipshits. What part of &quot;listen up boys, we are going to war with Melvin and his cocaine fueled buddies, some of you may die. Are you in?&quot; did you not understand?</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t a goddamn walk in the park where your wife and her boyfriend put you on a leash and tie you to a post so they could go snuggle under a blanket in the woods. ITS FUCKING COMBAT. You know what happens in combat? SOMETIMES YOU FUCKING BLEED. I don&#39;t know how the fuck you guys are smart enough to open reddit but so braindead that you can&#39;t see that your tiny Trump hands are being mushroom stamped into submission by the big boys. </p>\n\n<p>This is <strong>Catholic School The Play</strong> casted by Melvin as the priest and all you dipshit retards are signing up to be the altar boys. Why don&#39;t you just bend over right here and willingly spread your ass cheeks until all your spare change falls out of your pockets?</p>\n\n<p>Stop being so scared of a couple red days. Our brothers in arms over in Palantir have been fighting by our side for like a month and all you dumbfuck paper handed bitches start crying after taking a few shots. Get used to some red. Like your wife&#39;s boyfriend says, &quot;I don&#39;t mind ketchup on my hot dog as long as the bun is tight.&quot; Well we know you small peckered bitch boys didn&#39;t cause anything to loosen up so we know he&#39;s telling the truth. Guess fucking what? THIS GME BUN IS SO FUCKING TIGHT IT&#39;S GONNA SQUEEZE LIKE NOTHING YOU&#39;VE SEEN BEFORE. Yeah, get ready for some blood red ketchup and keep jamming it forward. If you can&#39;t do that, go check out <a href=\"/r/investing\">r/investing</a> and leave your shriveled up raisin nuts on my desk as you head out. </p>\n\n<p>What do we all have in common? We are so fucking retarded that we can&#39;t even be reasoned with. Of all things to be afraid of, you guys are shitting your depends about a dude named Melvin. He might as well have been named Pubert because obviously his parents hate him. </p>\n\n<p>Who wins a war? A dude with a name as bad as Melvin, or a bunch of Wendy&#39;s fueled brainless retards chasing tendies with absolutely no concept of risk management? The answer is obviously us. We are so fucking stupid that nobody can calculate our moves. We are an unpredictable force. Instead of using TA or market sentiment, we just say &quot;hUrr DuRr StOnkS OnLy Go UP. Wow, I know 2 of those letters! All in for these FD&#39;s&quot; while we are pissing in a bottle and preparing to jerk off for the 8th time since breakfast. </p>\n\n<p>What we don&#39;t have in brains, we also don&#39;t have in capital. What we do have though, is something special. We are in a fight with somebody even stupider than us. They stand to lose more money than it would cost for your wife to be exclusive to you. </p>\n\n<p>Now for the final fucking time. Go change your diaper, prep for some ketchup on this tight bun and squeeze everything your absolutely retarded dimwit ass can find into GME shares. Stop getting cucked by Melvin and bitching about it left and right. We don&#39;t even have to say pleas, GME WILL FUCKING FLY AGAIN. </p>\n\n<p>GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 </p>\n\n<p>Also, why the fuck couldn&#39;t I flair this as a shitpost?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqylsr/attention_all_gme_paper_handed_money_haters/","title":"Attention All GME Paper Handed Money Haters","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-06T06:45:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-06 06:45","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kqylsr","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqylsr/attention_all_gme_paper_handed_money_haters/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqylsr/attention_all_gme_paper_handed_money_haters/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"jbro12345","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jbro12345","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"jbro12345","score":1073,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"请注意，所有GME纸张递给憎钱的人","the_new_excerpt":"是的，我又回来了，因为你们这些弱智就是控制不了自己。“哦，我的天哪！\n你会在这里赔钱吗？！“是的笨蛋。”听好了，伙计们，我们是\n和梅尔文和他的可卡因伙伴去打仗，你们中的一些人可能会死。\n你加入了吗？“你不明白吗？\n\n这不是他妈的散步…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"請注意，所有GME紙張遞給憎錢的人","the_new_excerpt":"是的，我又回來了，因爲你們這些弱智就是控制不了自己。“哦，我的天哪！\n你會在這裏賠錢嗎？！“是的笨蛋。”聽好了，夥計們，我們是\n和梅爾文和他的可卡因夥伴去打仗，你們中的一些人可能會死。\n你加入了嗎？“你不明白嗎？\n\n這不是他媽的散步…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l11cw9","excerpt":"I’m very skeptical about ICLN.
