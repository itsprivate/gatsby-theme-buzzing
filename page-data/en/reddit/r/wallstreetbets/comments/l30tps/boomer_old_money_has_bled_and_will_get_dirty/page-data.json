They don’t want the competition on market forces or adapt to new technology for better researching and information sharing so now, they will lobby Congress to change the laws and they will do it quickly because they have the money to do it. </p>\n\n<p>Add 1 - please upvote and pin, make sure every retard reads this!!! It’s like a poker game, never show your cards, have poker face, and don’t ever  count your money at the table. (Kenny Rogers i fucked up the quote but I’m retarded so whatever)</p>\n\n<p>Add 2- No to going “underground” either. We are an OPEN forum. People can come and go as they please just like a SIDEWALK OR STREET CORNER. Underground suggests organization lol.</p>\n\n<p>Fellow retards, many of you may not realize it but, the corporate world is fucking brutal and basically animalistic warfare. Don’t believe me? Read “Barbarians at the Gate” or watch the movie if you’re too retarded and you can’t read <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iPhF_YwWvoM\">TV Movie Here</a>. \nWe made Citron and Melvin Bleed this week (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2wz14/melvin_hit_hard_by_the_wsb_retards_doesnt_stop/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\">Melvin</a>  had to get $1billion money loan Citron did it in 2018 on Tesla Loss) and they don’t like that. If you saw the letter they tweeted out you’d see why we gotta watch out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/citronresearch2/status/1352627162508005376?s=21\">Citron getting defensive laying the groundwork for a counter.</a>. They are already setting up the groundwork to get law enforcement and SEC involved. They’ve alleged that some idiots allegedly sent death threats, harassed and spammed there office email and phones, etc. As of now, there is no proof that it happened but even so this is a forum and it’s not responsible for individual being assholes. Boomer old money will get dirty and ethically dubious to maintain power rather than innovate and compete. I promise you, They are already meeting with one another to figure a way to turn this forum off. Corporate espionage, hostile takeovers, and crowd-outs...all’s fair in love and war I guess.</p>\n\n<p>We’re a forum, not an organization or a firm, and we need to make that painfully clear to every fucker who says otherwise (boomers looking in and newbies here). Optics and a paper trail to boot will ensure WSB stays a forum for all to come and yell out their yolos, give DD, view loss porn, and brag about gains! This isn’t a firm, we’re basically a bunch of retards yelling on the street corner or at the NY Stock Exchange floor yelling to buy waffles (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/fm2mlT7q7mY\">family guy scene - buy waffles aka this is us</a> ) that’s not illegal, that’s actually how stocks have been in the past, where where one retard  says “I hear business x has new shit, buy x!” Then everyone joins in the feeding frenzy to buy (or sell) x.  We’re just a digital version. None of this twitter account bs that we thankfully shit them up ( we really need them to shut it down completely). Members here, do not go and poke the beehive. <strong>If a new member does this shit they may be an infiltrator from the firm trying to sabotage us from within so be on the lookout for other people’s behavior.</strong> Let’s play this smart, keep comments and shut here and let’s all go to infinite and beyond! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l30tps/boomer_old_money_has_bled_and_will_get_dirty/","title":"Boomer Old Money has bled and will get dirty going forward.
