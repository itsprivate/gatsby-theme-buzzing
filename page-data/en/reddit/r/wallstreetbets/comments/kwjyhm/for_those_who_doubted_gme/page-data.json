Although maybe it opened your eyes to realize that WSB runs the market. We’re bigger than investment firms, hence why there’s still a play to be made.</p>\n\n<p>PLTR. Yet to explode, yet held on by all the same diamond hands of $GME. There’s a presentation at the end of this month for Palantir and it’s for showcasing their technology so shareholders and people who haven’t gotten in yet can better understand the product they’re providing. Although you don’t want to get in after the presentation, you need to get in before. If you think that $GME is exploding, just wait because $PLTR is known by everyone. I’ve even heard random idiots at bars talking about it. The amount of diamond 💎 hands 🖐 in PLTR is catastrophic, there’s no doubt that this company will succeed in the future. </p>\n\n<p>Lockup.</p>\n\n<p>Lockup period is coming to an end, and shareholders will be selling of their stakes. It’s inevitable, but that’s why you make a play on PLTR now because the drive up before lockup will be something extraordinary since shareholders will try to maximize their gains upon lockup ending. Take those GME tendies and put them straight back into the market with good ol’ Palantir.</p>\n\n<p>Make some money now, sell before lockup and screw over the shareholders by forcing them to hold their shares once again. The amount of volume upon lockup ending will be tremendous and quite possibly the biggest shit show of 2021. I’m in for the ride and hope you guys are too.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Presentation end of month = Drive up in stock price. Lockup in early February = Drive up for shareholders to capitalize their gains.</p>\n\n<p>Positions: 400 Shares @ 26.4, 1/15 27c , 1/22 28c</p>\n\n<p>Edit: 🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwjyhm/for_those_who_doubted_gme/","title":"For those who doubted $GME.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-14T03:00:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-14 03:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kwjyhm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwjyhm/for_those_who_doubted_gme/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwjyhm/for_those_who_doubted_gme/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"shuffil","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/shuffil","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"shuffil","score":1282,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"对于那些怀疑通用汽车E。","the_new_excerpt":"在今天的整个过程中，你会看到很多增益色情。对于那些\n你们谁的纸手，我很抱歉。虽然也许它打开了你的眼睛\n意识到WSB运行市场。我们比投资公司更大 因此\n还有一出戏要做。\n\nPLTR. 尚未爆发，却又保持着...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對於那些懷疑通用汽車E。","the_new_excerpt":"在今天的整個過程中，你會看到很多增益色情。對於那些\n你們誰的紙手，我很抱歉。雖然也許它打開了你的眼睛\n意識到WSB運行市場。我們比投資公司更大 因此\n還有一齣戲要做。\n\nPLTR. 尚未爆發，卻又保持着...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kwlqt2","excerpt":"I made an ETF screener to help me keep track of what sectors and industries are\ndoing well.\n\nSome recent top performing ETF include\n\nCHIQ (China Consumer Discretionary)\n\nCIBR(Cybersecurity)\n\nXRT(Retail)\n\nCOPX(Global Copper Miners)\n\nPSCM(Small Cap Materials)\n\nyou can see a full list of the ETFs at…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kwlqt2/i_made_an_etf_screener/","title":"I made an ETF screener","date":"January 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我做了一个ETF筛选器","the_new_excerpt":"我做了一个ETF筛选器，以帮助我跟踪哪些行业和产业是。\n做得好。\n\n近期表现最好的ETF包括\n\n中消协\n\nCIBR(网络安全)\n\nXRT(零售)\n\nCOPX(全球铜矿公司)\n\nPSCM(小盘材料)\n\n你可以看到完整的ETF列表，在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我做了一個ETF篩選器","the_new_excerpt":"我做了一個ETF篩選器，以幫助我跟蹤哪些行業和產業是。\n做得好。\n\n近期表現最好的ETF包括\n\n中消協\n\nCIBR(網絡安全)\n\nXRT(零售)\n\nCOPX(全球銅礦公司)\n\nPSCM(小盤材料)\n\n你可以看到完整的ETF列表，在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kwm4h9","excerpt":"Ur-Energy $URG is a mining company that engages in uranium mining and recovery\noperations, with activities including acquisition, exploration, development, and\noperation of uranium mineral properties.
