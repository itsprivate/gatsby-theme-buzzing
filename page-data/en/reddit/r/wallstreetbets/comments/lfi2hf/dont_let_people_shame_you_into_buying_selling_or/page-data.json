We joke and talk shit which is fine and all, but you have no idea what people are doing outside of what they commented. The majority of people here are likely in it for themselves. You don&#39;t know what their motivation is, be it telling people to buy/hold for those looking to cash in, those who &quot;just like the stock&quot;, or those that say sell because they are &quot;shills&quot; or have some other ulterior motive. Maybe they are trying to look out for you. Maybe not.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day stop letting emotions and the temperature of this and other subreddits dictate your choices. What happens here might influence the market, but I&#39;ve seen too many posts about diamond hands and monkey grips with the stock continuing to decline to think we have any significant role in what happens with the price. Don&#39;t put in what you can&#39;t risk to lose; it isn&#39;t worth it.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR - If you want to buy - buy. If you want to hold - hold. If you want to sell - sell. But for fuck&#39;s sake be careful.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfi2hf/dont_let_people_shame_you_into_buying_selling_or/","title":"Don't let people shame you into buying, selling, or holding your stock","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T06:43:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 06:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lfi2hf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfi2hf/dont_let_people_shame_you_into_buying_selling_or/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfi2hf/dont_let_people_shame_you_into_buying_selling_or/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"thjeco","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/thjeco","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"thjeco","score":3280,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"不要让别人羞辱你买入、卖出或持有你的股票。","the_new_excerpt":"我像其他人一样跳上了火车，但开始注意到很多的恶意\n以及对这些备忘录的未来有不同想法的人之间的不和谐。\n股票。\n\n重要的是大家要记住这里的每个人都是陌生人。\n我们开玩笑和谈论狗屎 这是很好的，所有，但你... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不要讓別人羞辱你買入、賣出或持有你的股票。","the_new_excerpt":"我像其他人一樣跳上了火車，但開始注意到很多的惡意\n以及對這些備忘錄的未來有不同想法的人之間的不和諧。\n股票。\n\n重要的是大家要記住這裏的每個人都是陌生人。\n我們開玩笑和談論狗屎 這是很好的，所有，但你... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lmyy7p","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmyy7p/he_got_trapped/","title":"He got trapped!!","date":"February 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"他被困住了！","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"他被困住了！","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26188765","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26188765","title":"12 requests per second: A realistic look at Python web frameworks","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 19, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"每秒12个请求：Python网络框架的真实面貌","locale":"zh"},{"title":"每秒12個請求：Python網絡框架的真實面貌","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lfi2hf","previousId":"RedditPost-lmyy7p","nextId":"HnPost-26188765","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfi2hf/dont_let_people_shame_you_into_buying_selling_or/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
