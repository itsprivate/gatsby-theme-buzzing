So what&#39;s holding us back from getting on their event tomorrow and just filling the seats with Autists? Heck we have enough strenght in numbers to bombard their stupid event tomorrow to the point they cannot host the event due either due to lewd and rude behavior or that the event just collapses due to hosting issues.</p>\n\n<p>All I am saying is that sure we can take the high road, or we can all just teach that fat fuck one final lesson and make it impossible for him to host such a stupid event. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Why don&#39;t we all just jump on the event tomorrow and drop rocket ships left and right till the man just can&#39;t take it anymore. </p>\n\n<p>Also what is he going to suggest, short the stock?
