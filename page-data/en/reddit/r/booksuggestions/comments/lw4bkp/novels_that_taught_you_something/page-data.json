I have almost exclusively read nonfiction until this year and I’m trying to jump into novels that you can really lose yourself in. But I really like to learn something when I read a book. What are some novels you read recently that left you with some new knowledge on a subject, culture, historical event, etc. ? I recently read Kite Runner and had to have Wikipedia/Google open the whole time so that I could learn more about the context of the era and the situation in Afghanistan and I really enjoyed reading a story that had me doing my own research at the same time. </p>\n\n<p>Recent nonfiction I read/am reading, if that helps:\nThe Demon in the Freezer - Richard Preston\nHow to Hide an Empire - David Immerwahr\nThe New Jim Crow - Michelle Alexander\nThey Were Her Property - Stephanie E.
