My father chose to go to a park, and spend his last moments watching the sunset before going off a trail to take his life. This process has been difficult to say the least.</p>\n\n<p>I love reading detective books - right now I’m having a difficult time with that. I’m in the middle of the Tracy Crosswhite series and I while I love the books I need something else to read because there are too many similarities right now. I’d like to find something that deals with loss, but in an indirect way. Preferably something with a sci-fi or fantasy twist. </p>\n\n<p>Some of my fav books are: the Heart Shaped Box by Joe Hill, Martian by Andy Weir, Kill Time &amp; Running Time by TJ MacGregor, Dresden Files by Jim Butcher, Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold, The Host by Stephanie Meyer. I have so many more but I think these should give enough context to what I like to read. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your recommendations!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/li4b1f/tw_recently_lost_my_father_to_suicide_looking_for/","title":"TW: Recently lost my father to suicide.
