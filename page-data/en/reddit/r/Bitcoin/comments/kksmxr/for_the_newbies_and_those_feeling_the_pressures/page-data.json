It&#39;s a matter of WHEN, not IF. Could be today, tomorrow, next year or in 5 years. Odds are that it will be sooner, rather than later.</p>\n\n<p>For the average person who can only spare a small percentage of their income, my advice would be to invest as below (or some sort of variation of the below):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) - Pick your favourite exchange and set up automatic buys. Daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly - whatever you can SAFELY afford. You don&#39;t want to feel like you have to sell at some stage if you are running low on fiat. Set and forget. HODL.</li>\n<li>Lump Sum Purchasing* - Take 25-50% of the amount you calculated for DCA&#39;ing, and instead put it aside in an account for two reasons.<br/>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Buying The Dip - Pretty self explanatory really. Buy when it&#39;s cheap, to maximize your investment. </li>\n<li>FOMO Buying - FOMO happens to even the best of us, trust me. What matters is how you react to the feeling. In moments of FOMO (bull runs), you may be just a click or two from depositing ALL your money in, which could be disastrous if the price drops significantly. Instead, invest a smaller percentage of this fund to help keep your emotions in check.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>*My personal rule with lump sum purchasing, is to always invest 50% of my fund, regardless of whether I&#39;m buying the dip, or FOMO buying. If I buy at the All-Time-High (ATH) and it crashes, that allows me to buy the dip and average my cost down significantly. Vice versa, if I buy the dip and we see a bull run, it allows me to continue buying as the price goes up. By investing 50% of the value of my fund each buy, it typically never reaches $0.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regardless of the above, the #1 rule is still to buy &amp; HODL. As we continue to see ATHs, EVERYONE who has HODL has made money.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kksmxr/for_the_newbies_and_those_feeling_the_pressures/","title":"For the newbies and those feeling the pressures of FOMO during bull run","tags":["Bitcoin","reddit"],"date":"December 27, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-27T13:34:05.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-27 13:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kksmxr","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kksmxr/for_the_newbies_and_those_feeling_the_pressures/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kksmxr/for_the_newbies_and_those_feeling_the_pressures/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bitcoin","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin","author":"M2RSHY","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/M2RSHY","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"M2RSHY","score":142,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"对于新手和那些在牛市期间感受到FOMO压力的人","the_new_excerpt":"月球情绪正在上升到我们在2017年看到的水平，我确实同意这一点\n这一次有所不同，但与任何投资一样，您应该始终期待\n任何事情都有可能发生。\n\n还会有另一次健康的大规模回调。这只是时间问题，不是会不会的问题。\n可能是今天、明天、明年或…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對於新手和那些在牛市期間感受到FOMO壓力的人","the_new_excerpt":"月球情緒正在上升到我們在2017年看到的水平，我確實同意這一點\n這一次有所不同，但與任何投資一樣，您應該始終期待\n任何事情都有可能發生。\n\n還會有另一次健康的大規模回調。這只是時間問題，不是會不會的問題。\n可能是今天、明天、明年或…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kl143z","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kl143z/when_employee_of_the_month/","title":"When employee of the month??","date":"December 27, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"什么时候的月度最佳员工？？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"什麼時候的月度最佳員工？？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kl14np","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kl14np/the_tribe_has_spoken_this_time_its_28k/","title":"The tribe has spoken.
