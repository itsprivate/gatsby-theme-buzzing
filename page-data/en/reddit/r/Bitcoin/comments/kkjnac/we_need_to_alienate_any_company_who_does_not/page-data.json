This was completely avoidable as the idiots at ledger hard coded an API key somewhere that anyone with basic web knowledge could copy paste to get access to their entire unencrypted customer database which they didn’t even need to keep for more than 30 days anyway. </p>\n\n<p>I think the only way we can make sure that all companies and directors and staff respect our privacy is to completely alienate them from the entire crypto community if they fuck up. This is not an attack on ledger. This is for the good and safety of the entire crypto community movement. We cannot accept or forgive companies who cut corners and make mistakes like this as other companies will continue to cut corners and think making mistakes like this is forgivable. </p>\n\n<p>There needs to be consequences and the only way we can make sure this never happens again is to threaten any business with complete isolation. No more sales. Not welcome at events. No more interaction on social media. If Ledger are at a conference or industry event, I won’t be going. I have removed the stickers from my laptop and I won’t be using their software anymore. Once I can find a suitable alternative I will be throwing away my devices. I was a proud customer and recommended them to dozens of people but now I look at my devices with disgust. </p>\n\n<p>Ledger is a “security company” who cant even secure access to their entire customer database. Companies who want to collect our private information need to know that it comes with the ultimate price. If they fuck up and our information is leaked online, it’s over. The worst that will happen is they loose their business. 250,000 of us have lost our privacy and that is immeasurably worse.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kkjnac/we_need_to_alienate_any_company_who_does_not/","title":"We need to alienate any company who does not protect all customer data.
