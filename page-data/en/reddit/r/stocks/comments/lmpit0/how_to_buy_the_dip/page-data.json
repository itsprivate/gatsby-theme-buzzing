The market never goes up in a straight line. It zigzags, selling off when stocks climb too high too fast — and when the market contains too much froth and speculation — which creates buying opportunities as prices fall. </p>\n\n<p>I know: Looking at your portfolio on red days is difficult. So don’t! Do not look at how much you’re down in one day, or in individual positions. That data will only deject you. Rather, scroll down to the stocks you want to buy. Skip the painful part and go directly to the deals.</p>\n\n<p>And remember: all signs point to this market recovering from here, and then reaching over 4000SPX in the relatively near future. Most end-of-year projections from Wall Street have the S&amp;P finishing 2021 around 4300-4500. That’s quite the yearly gain! We want to be in this market long-term, as vaccines roll out and the economy recovers and booms.</p>\n\n<p>So how to buy the dip?</p>\n\n<p>You should have a list of stocks you’re watching. Either these are stocks you want to own, or current positions you want to increase. Determine what entry point you want to buy. And keep an eye on our market support levels, which are 3850SPX-3775. Purchase a little bit at your price — or at support — to make sure you at least start a position, in case this dip is on the shorter side. From there, buy in tranches on the way down. Never buy all at once. Buy a little bit during the morning, afternoon and before the closing bell, to make sure you get a range of prices, including whatever turns out to be the best.</p>\n\n<p>And always assume the dip might last another day or so. Save some money for future, deeper selloffs in the days ahead, as the market goes through the volatile motions of a healthy selloff. Just as the market never goes straight up, it also zigzags on the way down. Give yourself the opportunity to buy over the course of several days. </p>\n\n<p>Buy the dip, and then thank yourself in the weeks and months ahead as these positions push into the green. That’s what’s worked for me. Do the bulk of your buying when other people are selling. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Obviously: I am not a professional financial advisor and this is not professional financial advice.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lmpit0/how_to_buy_the_dip/","title":"How to Buy the Dip","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-18T16:34:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-18 16:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lmpit0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lmpit0/how_to_buy_the_dip/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lmpit0/how_to_buy_the_dip/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"vacalicious","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/vacalicious","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"vacalicious","score":1233,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如何购买浸膏","the_new_excerpt":"像今天这样的下跌，是股市中自然、健康的一部分。市场\n从来没有直线上升。它蜿蜒曲折，当股票攀升过快时，就会抛售。\n高得太快--而当市场包含了太多的泡沫和投机--时，就会有更多的机会。\n这就为价格下跌创造了买入机会。\n\n我知道：...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何購買浸膏","the_new_excerpt":"像今天這樣的下跌，是股市中自然、健康的一部分。市場\n從來沒有直線上升。它蜿蜒曲折，當股票攀升過快時，就會拋售。\n高得太快--而當市場包含了太多的泡沫和投機--時，就會有更多的機會。\n這就爲價格下跌創造了買入機會。\n\n我知道：...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26296845","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26296845","title":"Little League wants all your information","date":"March 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"小联盟想要你所有的信息","locale":"zh"},{"title":"小聯盟想要你所有的信息","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lupiet","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lupiet/this_is_the_way/","title":"This is the way","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 01, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"是这样的","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"是這樣的","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lmpit0","previousId":"HnPost-26296845","nextId":"RedditPost-lupiet","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lmpit0/how_to_buy_the_dip/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
