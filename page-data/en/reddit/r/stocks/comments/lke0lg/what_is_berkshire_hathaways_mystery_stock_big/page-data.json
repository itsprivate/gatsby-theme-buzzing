The last such one was in 2015, and the mystery holding turned out to be Phillips 66 ￼ (PSX).</p>\n\n<p>The SEC can grant institutional investors confidential status if it agrees that public disclosure would move the stock price and make it more difficult for the investor to complete its buying program in the stock. It is possible that Berkshire will continue to keep the mystery holding confidential. News of a new Berkshire holding can sometimes boost the stock, thanks to the Buffett imprimatur.</p>\n\n<p>The mystery holding could be sizable, at $5 billion to $10 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Gary Black, a private investor and former CEO of both Aegon Asset Management and Janus Capital, surveyed his more than 50,000 Twitter followers and their top choices among four selections were Disney and PayPal.</p>\n\n<p>Black has been an influential bull on Tesla (TSLA), but said last week that he was out of the stock, citing the company’s lack of a clear forecast on 2021 deliveries and the risk of a first-quarter earnings miss.</p>\n\n<p>In recent quarters, Buffett has sold out of Berkshire’s holding in Goldman Sachs Group ￼ (GS), sharply reduced a stake in JPMorgan Chase ￼ (JPM), cut a longtime position in Wells Fargo ￼ (WFC) and bought stakes in a group of drug stocks notably Merck (MRK), AbbVie ￼ (ABBV), and Bristol Myers Squibb ￼ (BMY).</p>\n\n<p>Source: Barron&#39;s</p>\n\n<p>I think if Buffett select, it could be stable dividend payers such as xom, cvx and hd. But recent years his 2 managers will most likely pick techs, then googl and some other tech stocks will become target. Disney will be also favorable since it is the best recovery play stock with huge grow opportunity with streaming. What do you guys think.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the awards.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lke0lg/what_is_berkshire_hathaways_mystery_stock_big/","title":"What Is Berkshire Hathaway’s Mystery Stock?
