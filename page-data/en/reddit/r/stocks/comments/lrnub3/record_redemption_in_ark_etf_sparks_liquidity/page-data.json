More such redemptions would prompt Wood&#39;s fund to sell liquid holdings to manage the squeeze in the near-term before looking to unwind its illiquid holdings.</p>\n\n<p>Ark Invest meanwhile shuffled its portfolio on Tuesday by cutting its already-tiny holdings in Apple, Amazon, Taiwan Semiconductor and Google-owner Alphabet to beef-up its Tesla stake on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>This is one of the problem that ark funds is trying to mitigate. Many people are very bullish and saying they are 50 to 70% into the ark funds, but they don&#39;t even know what stocks are inside these funds.
