My understanding is that this is down to the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>Other small oil companies are down about 20-40% of where they were 12 months ago. </p>\n\n<p>OPEC are meeting next month and are likely to maintain production output at its current level, according to the Iraqi Oil Minister a few days ago, possibly into April before they reassess it.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m just looking at Oil as a very long term play... </p>\n\n<p>Surely in 12-18 (maybe 24) months time, you&#39;d expect at least a 20 or 30% recovery when the Pandemic starts to subside.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate all the sentiment about Green Energy at the moment, but we need to accept that we&#39;re not all going to be driving Tesla and Nio vehicles anytime before 2025.

It&#39;s all going to pick up one day and they all need the black gold to function. I see demand increasing, dollar per barrel increasing, thus stonks go up.</p>\n\n<p>is there any reason I shouldnt be investing very long in oil?
