From age 18-19 I managed to save around 2 ounces of gold and 50 ounces of silver all while wasting my money on weed and nicotine. This made me realize how much money I&#39;ve wasted and I honestly got really sad because Ive worked my ass off and just let that money fly out the window. I&#39;ve quit weed and nicotine both and am really happy that I chose to do it now than later. Now to the actual part you came for. </p>\n\n<p>I want to build a strong portfolio of about 10-ish stocks for long term growth. I currently make around $2500 USD a month. </p>\n\n<p>I have a little over $1000 dollars I can invest each month. I would still like to invest in gold and a little silver but could use some guidance on some stock picks. I would like a a few dividend stocks, few ETS, Few structurally sound stocks, and maybe 1-2 higher risk ones. I just don&#39;t know exactly what will be safe and what will be around for years to come. I have a couple in mind for my portfolio but there&#39;s ALOT of stocks to pick from. I&#39;m not asking that you build my portfolio for me, but some guidance or advice on how to choose/build a good portfolio would be awesome!</p>\n\n<p>Have a great day :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lhwj1y/19_yo_seeking_help_for_a_strong_longterm/","title":"19 Y/O seeking help for a strong long-term portfolio.
