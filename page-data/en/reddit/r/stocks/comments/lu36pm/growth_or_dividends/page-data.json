Still in my early 30&#39;s, no debt, some cash on the side, have a house of my own and a 401(k) with the company I&#39;ve worked for the past 10 years. I&#39;ve been building mainly a portfolio based on high yields stocks and ETFs. However, I recently read that the market tends to grow 10% per year in average. Would that mean that for me to build a dividends portfolio that keeps up with the Market I&#39;d have to have an average 10% yield across the whole thing? Should I start getting more into Index ETFs or are dividend stocks a good way to play the game?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lu36pm/growth_or_dividends/","title":"Growth or Dividends?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-28T15:35:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-28 15:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lu36pm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lu36pm/growth_or_dividends/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lu36pm/growth_or_dividends/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"AmrasVardamir","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/AmrasVardamir","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"AmrasVardamir","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"增长还是分红？","the_new_excerpt":"我想为退休后的生活建立一个投资组合。我还在30岁出头，没有\n债务，一些现金，有自己的房子和401(k)与我自己。\n我已经在这家公司工作了10年。我一直在建立主要的投资组合\n基于高收益率的股票和ETF。然而，我最近看到...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"增長還是分紅？","the_new_excerpt":"我想爲退休後的生活建立一個投資組合。我還在30歲出頭，沒有\n債務，一些現金，有自己的房子和401(k)與我自己。\n我已經在這家公司工作了10年。我一直在建立主要的投資組合\n基於高收益率的股票和ETF。然而，我最近看到...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26290705","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26290705","title":"Universal Radio Hacker: Investigate Wireless Protocols Like a Boss","date":"February 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"通用无线电黑客：像老板一样调查无线协议。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"通用無線電黑客：像老闆一樣調查無線協議。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26290309","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26290309","title":"Try the new try.haxe","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 28, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"试试新的try.haxe","locale":"zh"},{"title":"試試新的try.haxe","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lu36pm","previousId":"HnPost-26290705","nextId":"HnPost-26290309","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lu36pm/growth_or_dividends/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
