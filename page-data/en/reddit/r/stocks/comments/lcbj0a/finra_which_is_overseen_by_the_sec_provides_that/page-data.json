At the origination was S3 Partners&#39; announcement that the short interest for GME has drastically plummeted during the initial &quot;squeeze&quot;, to a value of ~51%. S3 Partners was, to many people, a highly trusted source of information.</p>\n\n<p>However, information thrown to the side--with perhaps less popularity--is FINRA&#39;S providence on GME&#39;s short interest, being 226%. I know many of the new members of this subreddit are unsure about where to get information or which info is misinformed and which isn&#39;t, however I believe I&#39;d put my trust in the SEC -- part of the governmental body -- over a firm, S3 partners.</p>\n\n<p>To some, I know this is not new news but it&#39;s assuring to have information which is reliable in these times strewn with misinformation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does this tell us?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Prior to the initial squeeze, the short interest to GameStop was 144%. The data provided by FINRA shows that shorts have doubled down on their position and to a greater extent, at that.</p>\n\n<p>If you still like this stock, I thought this would be useful information. </p>\n\n<p>But please, correct me if I&#39;m wrong.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lcbj0a/finra_which_is_overseen_by_the_sec_provides_that/","title":"Finra, which is overseen by the SEC, provides that short interest on Gamestop is 226.42%","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-04T13:22:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-04 13:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lcbj0a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcbj0a/finra_which_is_overseen_by_the_sec_provides_that/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcbj0a/finra_which_is_overseen_by_the_sec_provides_that/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"PikeEater47","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PikeEater47","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"PikeEater47","score":106,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"由证监会监管的Finra规定，Gamestop的空头权益为226.42%。","the_new_excerpt":"由美国证券交易委员会（SEC）监督的Finra规定，Gamestop上的空头利息为\n226.42%\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n资料来源\nhttp://finra...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"由證監會監管的Finra規定，Gamestop的空頭權益爲226.42%。","the_new_excerpt":"由美國證券交易委員會（SEC）監督的Finra規定，Gamestop上的空頭利息爲\n226.42%\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n資料來源\nhttp://finra...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lieb7j","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lieb7j/waking_up_to_make_sure_my_meme_stonks_are_still/","title":"Waking up to make sure my meme stonks are still down","date":"February 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"醒来后确认我的备忘录石碑还没倒下","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"醒來後確認我的備忘錄石碑還沒倒下","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ligil0","excerpt":"Great companies tout free cash flow growth.\n\nIf companies don't have that, they tout revenue growth.\n\nIf companies don't have either, they tout total addressable market.\n\nThat is all.
