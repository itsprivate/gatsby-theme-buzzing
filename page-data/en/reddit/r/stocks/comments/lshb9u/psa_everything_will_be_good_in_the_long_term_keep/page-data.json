Plenty of people’s portfolio’s are getting hit hard since their portfolios consist of tech, more or less. I just wanted to encourage people and say that there’s no need to be worried. You’ve done (at least you should have) your DD on your investments and you know why they are good. You know that they are good and will perform well in the long term. </p>\n\n<p>Short term volatility doesn’t matter in the long term. I’ve heard many successful CEOs like Bezos talk about how he doesn’t care about the volatility in the short term. And in my opinion, this is a very important thing to remember during times when there is a lot of short term volatility.</p>\n\n<p>I think selling is necessary only if something really negative is happening within the company or the sector. If it’s just healthy market behaviour, you shouldn’t be worried.</p>\n\n<p>This quote by Benjamin Graham, the author of the Intelligent Investor is really good and should be remembered always.</p>\n\n<p>”In the short term, the market is voting machnie, but in the long term the market is a weighing machine.”</p>\n\n<p>The people that hold strong companies will be rewarded sooner or later. But it’s on your shoulders to stay calm and head towards the future without hesitation. </p>\n\n<p>If you are gaining wealth slowly with your own solid stocks, you’ll have your happy days. It might not be tomorrow or maybe not even in 8 years, but trust me, if you’ve done research, it’ll come. </p>\n\n<p>Good feelings to everybody. Have a good one!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lshb9u/psa_everything_will_be_good_in_the_long_term_keep/","title":"PSA: Everything will be good in the long term.
