What is my opinion on the NIO stock after their latest event? DraftKings &amp; PENN soar after the latest New York developments, let’s talk about this and other stock market news</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>~Very Long Post~</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/zr3x08Q\">Nasdaq Composite</a> leading the way up over 1% and finished the week 2.4% up, the broad stock market <a href=\"https://ibb.co/9ghJQfk\">SP500</a> also gaining more than half a percent on Friday and 1.8% for the week while the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/w4Xrnvk\">Dow Jones</a> rose by 56 points and finished 1.6% higher in the first week of 2021, with all 3 big indexes finishing at new all-time highs. We also saw the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/vdYffjm\">VIX</a> dropping below 22 again, despite a mid-day spike, as the volatility index dropped more than 23% since the high on <a href=\"https://ibb.co/C8xQvsN\">Tuesday</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We saw an average <a href=\"https://ibb.co/VTPKM80\">DAY</a> of trading to close out the week, with average volume and an almost equal number of companies that were advancing compared to the declining ones, as 7 of the 11 <a href=\"https://ibb.co/gDFHxLf\">SECTORS</a> finished in the green, with consumer Discretionary &amp; Real Estate Leading the way, while the more value heavy industries lagged. For the week though, Energy outperformed, rising by more than 9%, Technology finished flat despite a very bad start to the week after the Georgia election and Real Estate lagged behind, losing 2.5% for the week, as we saw Large-Cap growth companies outperform on <a href=\"https://ibb.co/b24dvCn\">Friday</a>, but in this fresh 2021, small &amp; mid-caps have outperformed.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/G0YW732\">HEAT MAP</a> from Friday, with big gainers coming mostly in the consumer cyclicals, with Tesla, Alibaba &amp; MercadoLibre posting big gains, while the biggest losers were in the gold industry.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://ibb.co/MBH11mV\">THIS</a> short year though, we can see the huge outperformance of the Energy Sector, the Banks and some other names like Tesla &amp; TSM.</p>\n\n<p>We also got some economic data, with the latest Redfin report showing a 13% increase in home sale <a href=\"https://ibb.co/HV9CqQg\">PRICES</a> over 2020, as <a href=\"https://ibb.co/5nwRLMB\">ACTIVE</a> listings of homes for sales keeps on dropping. The listings have seen a 32% decrease since last year to a new all-time low, though, the average sale to list <a href=\"https://ibb.co/vcX1Jpw\">PRICE</a> ratio finally declined to 99.3%, as the housing market was red hot since June.</p>\n\n<p>While December nonfarm payroll <a href=\"https://ibb.co/GT72GvR\">declined</a> by 140K, worse than then 75k gains expected and is the first month since April that brings jobs losses with most of the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/hKwgGqN\">JOBS</a> losses coming from the leisure and hospitality business which has been hit hard again, losing almost half a million jobs, while the unemployment rate did inch lower to 6.7%.</p>\n\n<p>So, this week pretty much starts of the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/7GPMmkJ\">EARNINGS</a> season again, with the most interesting ones for me being, Aphria as a read on the cannabis sector, Delta Airlines for a read on how the Airlines are recovering and JP Morgan on Friday, while on the economic front we will see a lot of interesting <a href=\"https://ibb.co/X5FVfBB\">DATA</a>, mostly starting on Wednesday with the Consumer price index and the Federal Budget, while we continue these with the jobless claims on Thursday and more numbers about the economy on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>This week we will also have some <a href=\"https://ibb.co/HKJXY8K\">IPOs</a> with the most interesting coming from Affirm Holdings, while I really expect to see what Biden <a href=\"https://ibb.co/rpTRtKN\">SAYS</a> on Thursday as this may be key to a further stimulus or fiscal package.</p>\n\n<p>So, NIO <a href=\"https://ibb.co/MBB053y\">DAY</a> came and left me with rather somewhat of a disappointment, though I don’t expect most investors to really look at this, so they will probably jump on the stock again this week, so here is a quick recap of what they announced and what is my opinion on NIO:</p>\n\n<p>They announced the first flagship sedan mode, the ET7 which will be <a href=\"https://ibb.co/0jkgfTm\">AVAILABLE</a> in 2 trim levels with 70 or 100KW battery starting from around $70K and $78K, but the good thing about NIO, and their main competitive advantage is the battery as a service. So, they will make this new sedan available for the same price with either battery pack if you do use the BAAS model at a price of $58K.</p>\n\n<p>They also announced the next gen battery swap stations that can do over 300swaps/day, more than 3x the capability of the current one, as they also plan to build another 400 stations that would bring them to a total of almost 600 by the end of the year.</p>\n\n<p>The “new battery technology” that they announced was the actual thing that disappointed me. So, they announced a 150KW battery with a claimed range of over 600miles, but that should be in perfect conditions, so expect the actual range to be somewhere in 400mile range, pretty much in line with Tesla’s current capabilities. The Launch <a href=\"https://ibb.co/9WK8dJW\">DATE</a> for the car is still only Q1 2022 while for the “New Solid-State battery” the timeline is for it to be available by the end of 2022. So, the bad thing is that everything is still at least 1 year away and we have to see if the claimed range for the new battery is real.</p>\n\n<p>And there are a couple of big warning signs here with the new battery technology, they actually avoided saying they designed, created or engineered this new tech battery, by saying they will <a href=\"https://ibb.co/dDDpkm5\">ADOPT</a> this new technology. So, it seems they will adopt this new technology from their current battery supplier CATL. This is an issue as this battery will be available to other manufacturers like Hyundai, Mercedes BMW will get their hands on, so this will not actually be something innovative, ground-breaking or a proprietary solution.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I don’t know how big this new Sedan thing is, because the Sedan market is really dying around the world. This new ET7 isn’t competition for TESLA 3, it’s targeted for competition against the model S, which is already a dying segment as you can see from Tesla’s <a href=\"https://ibb.co/smr7vNN\">SALES</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But on some more positive news, they did announce something better in my opinion, with their Self-Driving Feature, <a href=\"https://ibb.co/ss65yw6\">INCLUDING</a>11 8megapixel cameras, as their collaboration with <a href=\"https://ibb.co/C5bNBGK\">Nvidia</a> will produce a super-computer that will generate up to 8Gigabyte/s of data, with the Nvidia CORE estimated to be 7x better than Tesla’s current computer. Though <a href=\"https://ibb.co/M61cLRm\">THIS</a> doesn’t have an official release date and will probably come with the ET7 next year, so, another disappointment as this comp against Tesla will not be a huge advantage once Tesla does upgrade their computers as well.</p>\n\n<p>So, for short the main competitive advantages that <a href=\"https://ibb.co/3c5Q80j\">NIO</a> has right now are that they use the subscription model for both the battery swap technology and for the full-self driving feature which costs around $100/month. This is are very good and smart recurring revenue streams, as they make the entry price for the car much lower and also provide a stable flow of revenues. But… I am disappointed in the “new battery technology” and have to wait for more developments. If this is a common technology that will be used by other car manufacturers, this is effectively not that big of a deal, but if somehow this is their own technology, that would possibly have better implications for the company. So, guys, I own both Tesla &amp; NIO, and I think I might hold off right now on buying any more due to different factors. I think that Tesla has a good future, but this huge run-up has made it a good target for 10-20% correction at any point in the short-term future, while for NIO I expect this to rise in the next couple of days, and I am waiting for it to cool off a little before adding any more to my position. So, yeah, short-term I think both of them have some downside risk, but in the long run, I expect Tesla to trade at over $1000 and NIO to trade over $100.</p>\n\n<p>In some other stock market <a href=\"https://ibb.co/zJwMGgq\">NEWS</a>, we saw gambling stocks like DraftKings and PENN rising on Friday after New York filed bills to legalize online betting in the state. <a href=\"https://ibb.co/N2sDnH6\">DraftKings</a> also just announced they will bring new stuff like drone racing betting, which is mind-blowing, that they are extending into such things. This is a continuing trend in the US and should be watched for future developments, as gambling will be legalized pretty much all over the US in the near future I believe, and I also expect this sector to be joined by the pot <a href=\"https://ibb.co/Sf97NmW\">SECTOR</a>, even if it’s really hard to believe there will be a nationwide bill to legalize it, I expect there will be some improvements for the sector, and companies like Aphria which are closer to profitability should benefit from this.</p>\n\n<p>On some more sad new, we also saw a 27-year-old Boeing plane <a href=\"https://ibb.co/dg9yW5j\">crash</a> in Indonesia, this is very sad news, but as the stock market goes, this issue seems to be unrelated to <a href=\"https://ibb.co/bJwt3Lt\">Boeing</a> right now. Indonesia has seen the most deaths in the past decades, with over 104 accidents, as this country is known for bad maintenance, pilot training and air-traffic controls problems.</p>\n\n<p>And don’t forget, as I said in my earlier posts, don’t jump on these high-flying small cap stocks at all-time highs, this is a very good moment for this companies to raise cheap capital by issuing shares, with the latest example being <a href=\"https://ibb.co/pbG62F6\">BLNK</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets and the US <a href=\"https://ibb.co/f9RV9NM\">FUTURES</a> are pointing to a bad open right now, with all 3 big index futures down, as the DOW futures are down over 200 points</p>\n\n<p>🙏Thank you everyone for reading!🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content!
