Since returns are almost random it is very unlikely to give an exact forecast for tomorrow&#39;s return!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The higher the volatility, the larger the range of tomorrow&#39;s expected closing price, so you may have an idea about how much you can realistically gain or lose in a single day.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lquj16/pltr_volatility_forecast_and_price_range_wed_24/","title":"$PLTR Volatility Forecast and Price Range - Wed, 24 Feb","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-24T04:56:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-24 04:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lquj16","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lquj16/pltr_volatility_forecast_and_price_range_wed_24/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lquj16/pltr_volatility_forecast_and_price_range_wed_24/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Billy-Klein","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Billy-Klein","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Billy-Klein","score":58,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$PLTR波动率预测和价格范围 - 2月24日，星期三","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，对于我的学士论文，我正在使用GARCH-模型，这是一个工具。\n用于给定数据集的时间序列分析，以预测未来的波动率。\n\n在此之前，PLTR的一个问题是，我没有足够的数据，因为我没有足够的数据。\n股票是相当新的，所以当我把调整后的每日收盘... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$PLTR波動率預測和價格範圍 - 2月24日，星期三","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，對於我的學士論文，我正在使用GARCH-模型，這是一個工具。\n用於給定數據集的時間序列分析，以預測未來的波動率。\n\n在此之前，PLTR的一個問題是，我沒有足夠的數據，因爲我沒有足夠的數據。\n股票是相當新的，所以當我把調整後的每日收盤... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lql6th","excerpt":"What company will survive these bloody days?
