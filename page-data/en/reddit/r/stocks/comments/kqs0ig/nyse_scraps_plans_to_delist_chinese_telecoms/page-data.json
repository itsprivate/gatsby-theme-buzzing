They acted on guidance regarding the executive order,&quot; Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst from Oanda told the BBC.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That interpretation has clearly changed and the NYSE has moved quickly to change course,&quot; he added.</p>\n\n<p>The US exchange had planned to delist all three companies as early as this week.</p>\n\n<p>Shares of all three companies surged on the Hong Kong stock market - where the companies are also listed - bouncing back after from punishing sessions in both New York and Hong Kong.</p>\n\n<p>China Unicom rose by 8.5%, while China Telecom jumped 8% and China Mobile rebounded by 7% on the news.</p>\n\n<p>The NYSE indicated that it might revisit the decision, saying it would continue to evaluate the applicability of Mr Trump&#39;s Executive Order to the three companies and their continued listing status.</p>\n\n<h2>Dual listings</h2>\n\n<p>The three companies earn all of their revenue in China and have no significant presence in the US</p>\n\n<p>Like many other large Chinese companies, they have a dual listing in the US and Hong Kong.</p>\n\n<p>There are currently more than 200 Chinese companies listed on US stock markets with a total market capitalization of $2.2tn (£1.6tn).</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, however, their share listings have became tangled in ongoing diplomatic and trade friction between the US and China.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Trump has not only pushed for companies to be delisted, but has targeted a number of Chinese companies including TikTok, Huawei and Tencent on the grounds of national security.</p>\n\n<p>China responded with its own blacklist of US companies as tensions between the economic giants escalate.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday a spokeswoman for China&#39;s foreign ministry Hua Chunying had criticised the initial decision to delist the companies as &quot;unwise&quot; and reflective of how &quot;random, arbitrary and uncertain&quot; US rules can be.</p>\n\n<p>Some analysts expect the end of the Trump administration might lead to a lull in the trade dispute, as the Chinese government waits to see what approach incoming President Joe Biden might take to US-Chinese relations.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;These are the acts of a dying administration and China will probably be content to await President Biden, and more clarity then over the general path of US China relations from the new administration,&quot; said Mr Halley.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kqs0ig/nyse_scraps_plans_to_delist_chinese_telecoms/","title":"NYSE scraps plans to delist Chinese telecoms giants","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-05T13:51:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-05 13:51","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kqs0ig","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kqs0ig/nyse_scraps_plans_to_delist_chinese_telecoms/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kqs0ig/nyse_scraps_plans_to_delist_chinese_telecoms/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"repagator8","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/repagator8","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"repagator8","score":77,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"纽约证交所放弃中国电信巨头退市计划","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55540901\n\n\n\n纽约证券交易所(NYSE)已经放弃了三家公司退市的决定。\n中国电信公司。\n\n唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)总统在11月签署了一项行政命令，禁止美国人\n对军方拥有或控制的中国公司的投资。\n\nThe…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"紐約證交所放棄中國電信巨頭退市計劃","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55540901\n\n\n\n紐約證券交易所(NYSE)已經放棄了三家公司退市的決定。\n中國電信公司。\n\n唐納德·特朗普(Donald Trump)總統在11月簽署了一項行政命令，禁止美國人\n對軍方擁有或控制的中國公司的投資。\n\nThe…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25644056","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25644056","title":"GitHub blocks entire company because one employee was in Iran","date":"January 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"GitHub封锁了整个公司，因为有一名员工在伊朗","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GitHub封鎖了整個公司，因爲有一名員工在伊朗","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kqxjdz","excerpt":"Based on pre-IPO trading on prediction markets and FTX, Coinbase's implied IPO\nmarket capitalization is $64 billion.\n\nThis would place it in the Top 200 U.S. traded stocks by market cap\n[https://assetdash.com/] in the same range as:\n\n * Square 93B\n * Goldman Sachs $91B\n * Truist Financial $64B\n *…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kqxjdz/coinbases_expected_market_cap_at_ipo_is_6475/","title":"Coinbase's expected market cap at IPO is $64.75 Billion","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 05, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Coinbase首次公开募股(IPO)的预期市值为647.5亿美元","the_new_excerpt":"基于预测市场和FTX上的IPO前交易，Coinbase的隐含IPO\n市值为640亿美元。\n\n这将使其跻身按市值计算的美国交易量最大的200家股票公司之列\n[相同范围内的https://assetdash.com/]为：\n\n*广场93B\n*高盛910亿美元\n*Truist Financial 640亿美元\n*…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Coinbase首次公開募股(IPO)的預期市值爲647.5億美元","the_new_excerpt":"基於預測市場和FTX上的IPO前交易，Coinbase的隱含IPO\n市值爲640億美元。\n\n這將使其躋身按市值計算的美國交易量最大的200家股票公司之列\n[相同範圍內的https://assetdash.com/]爲：\n\n*廣場93B\n*高盛910億美元\n*Truist Financial 640億美元\n*…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kqs0ig","previousId":"HnPost-25644056","nextId":"RedditPost-kqxjdz","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kqs0ig/nyse_scraps_plans_to_delist_chinese_telecoms/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
