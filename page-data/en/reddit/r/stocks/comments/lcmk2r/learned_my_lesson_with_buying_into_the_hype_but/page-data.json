I could have sold at $20, but chose not to. When purchasing, I chose an amount that I was comfortable with losing, but also an amount that could provide me with significant returns if it went up a lot like everyone thought.</p>\n\n<p>Few things I&#39;ve learned from this... Don&#39;t buy into something just because everyone is doing it. Sounds easy, but evidently for many of us it&#39;s not. Whether you want to call it FOMO or peer pressure, you need to understand what you are getting into and the ramifications if it goes south. I bought in because of the hype and I think this has been a good learning moment for me. One of the biggest things I&#39;ve seen is the fact that there&#39;s so much false information going around that it&#39;s crazy. I can&#39;t count how many posts that say if we hold to this day and keep the price above X amount, it will go to the moon the next day. Truthfully, it seems majority of the people sharing these things know nothing about stocks. I have student loans that need to be paid off. My hope was that I&#39;d be a little closer to paying those off more quickly than previously planned.</p>\n\n<p>I am happy that I didn&#39;t purchase GME as I almost did when it was at $300. The great news is that AMC was at $10 for me and I still believe it will go higher than that. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to the moon. But, I do think we can eventually get to $20-$40 in the next few years. Millions of people have been stuck in their homes for about a year now. Once we get past Covid/many have the vaccination, people will go to AMC to watch the movies. There will be many amazing box office movies coming out in the next few years due them being delayed by Covid. So, AMC hasn&#39;t popped off like I had hoped for, but there is absolutely no reason to sell right now in my opinion because this is a long term play that can make me some money in the future. </p>\n\n<p>Who knows... Maybe it will still go to the moon. I&#39;d be thrilled! But, until then I will hold and be excited for the future when going to the movies is a popular thing to do again. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll probably get down voted for this post, but I think this is the truth for many of us here. Be careful with investments. I still hope for momentum to shift and make massive gains, but I also want to be realistic. I won&#39;t advise anyone here to buy or sell off these stocks. Ultimately, we have to make our own decisions. </p>\n\n<p>I started investing about a month and a half ago before the meme stocks. I was actually doing very well in that little time. This sets me back, but I will not make the same mistake again in the future. I&#39;ll stick with making smart choices and not complete risks.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: I bought into a meme stock. I learned my lesson. Don&#39;t fall for FOMO/Peer pressure. Make the best decision possible for yourself knowing the risks. A lot of people will lose money due to this. While I was in for a quick dollar, I will hold long-term now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lcmk2r/learned_my_lesson_with_buying_into_the_hype_but/","title":"Learned my Lesson with Buying into the Hype, but Will Still Hold Long Term","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-04T21:33:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-04 21:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lcmk2r","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcmk2r/learned_my_lesson_with_buying_into_the_hype_but/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcmk2r/learned_my_lesson_with_buying_into_the_hype_but/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"DrewMac380","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DrewMac380","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DrewMac380","score":731,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"吸取了我买入炒作的教训，但仍会长期持有。","the_new_excerpt":"我买AMC的股票时，它是10美元。我本可以在20美元时卖出，但我选择了不卖。\n到。在购买时，我选择了一个自己能承受损失的金额，但。\n也是一个可以为我提供可观回报的金额，如果它上升了一个。\n和大家想的一样\n\n我从中学到的一些东西... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"吸取了我買入炒作的教訓，但仍會長期持有。","the_new_excerpt":"我買AMC的股票時，它是10美元。我本可以在20美元時賣出，但我選擇了不賣。\n到。在購買時，我選擇了一個自己能承受損失的金額，但。\n也是一個可以爲我提供可觀回報的金額，如果它上升了一個。\n和大家想的一樣\n\n我從中學到的一些東西... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-liwxrz","excerpt":"Brothers, sisters, bisters, and sothers.\n\nWe come today to pay tribute to our good friend Keith Gill a.k.a. the messenger\nof the god of retards known as DFV.\n\nIn the next week Congress and their wife's boyfriend will be questioning our\nbeloved Keith Gill why he didn't use lube after destroying…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liwxrz/keith_gill_deepfuckingvalue_tribute/","title":"Keith Gill / DeepFuckingValue Tribute","date":"February 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Keith Gill / DeepFuckingValue Tribute","the_new_excerpt":"兄弟姐妹们，姐妹们，母亲们。\n\n我们今天是来向我们的好朋友基思-吉尔又名信使致敬的。\n被称为DFV的弱智之神。\n\n在下周，国会和他们妻子的男友将质疑我们的。\n心爱的基思-吉尔为什么在毁掉之后不用润滑油... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Keith Gill / DeepFuckingValue Tribute","the_new_excerpt":"兄弟姐妹們，姐妹們，母親們。\n\n我們今天是來向我們的好朋友基思-吉爾又名信使致敬的。\n被稱爲DFV的弱智之神。\n\n在下週，國會和他們妻子的男友將質疑我們的。\n心愛的基思-吉爾爲什麼在毀掉之後不用潤滑油... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lit39w","excerpt":"🦍 Ape bought $10M worth of GME near the peak of its Reddit-hype, the position\nis now worth $2M\n\n🦍 Ape also bought $1M in AMC and $1M in Silver\n\n\n\nArticle (trimmed):\n\nSun, the 30 year-old entrepreneur who bought $10 million worth of GameStop Corp.\nat the height of its Reddit-fueled rally, is…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lit39w/autist_rich_asian_ape_bought_10m_of_gme_near_its/","title":"Autist Rich Asian: Ape bought $10M of GME near its peak ($8M Loss)","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 13, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"自闭症富豪亚洲人。猩猩在高峰期附近买入1000万的金交所（亏损800万）。","the_new_excerpt":"🦍猿在Reddit-hype高峰期附近买入了价值1000万美元的GME，这个仓位\n现在价值200万\n\n🦍猿也买了100万美金的AMC和100万美金的Silver。\n\n\n\n文章（被删减）。\n\n孙，30岁的企业家谁买了1000万美元的价值GameStop公司。\n在Reddit推动的涨势最猛烈的时候，30岁的企业家孙先生正...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"自閉症富豪亞洲人。猩猩在高峯期附近買入1000萬的金交所（虧損800萬）。","the_new_excerpt":"🦍猿在Reddit-hype高峯期附近買入了價值1000萬美元的GME，這個倉位\n現在價值200萬\n\n🦍猿也買了100萬美金的AMC和100萬美金的Silver。\n\n\n\n文章（被刪減）。\n\n孫，30歲的企業家誰買了1000萬美元的價值GameStop公司。\n在Reddit推動的漲勢最猛烈的時候，30歲的企業家孫先生正...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lcmk2r","previousId":"RedditPost-liwxrz","nextId":"RedditPost-lit39w","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lcmk2r/learned_my_lesson_with_buying_into_the_hype_but/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
