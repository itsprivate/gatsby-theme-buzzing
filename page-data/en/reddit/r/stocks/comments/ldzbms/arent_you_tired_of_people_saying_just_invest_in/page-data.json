I know that most people are probably just saying it because they don&#39;t want anyone to lose money, and it&#39;s true that most people will be better off just by investing in the S&amp;P 500. If my mother wanted to invest, I&#39;d probably tell her the same thing, so I get it. But not anyone is like that, and I&#39;d like to see more encouragement in trying stuff, instead of just saying &quot;just put your money in the S&amp;P 500 and don&#39;t even try&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m fairly new to investing, but I get great joy from investing and researching companies. Investing in the S&amp;P 500 would be very boring for me. And I&#39;m also doing very well so far. I don&#39;t have a long track record at the moment obviously, since I&#39;ve been investing for only 2 years. So far, I&#39;ve always beat the S&amp;P 500 by a long margin . I know 2 years is not much, but hopefully I can continue doing great in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>I also want to be clear about the fact that I don&#39;t do day trading or any of this stuff. I&#39;m sure I wouldn&#39;t be able to beat the S&amp;P 500 if I did that.</p>\n\n<p>My tactic is very simple: I buy great stocks and I hold. I never panic sell. And when things go badly and maybe some stocks go down 20%, that&#39;s when I buy more, because I still believe in my companies. I&#39;ve managed to cut out all of the emotions and it served me very well so far.</p>\n\n<p>I know that many people don&#39;t beat the S&amp;P 500 in the long run, but it&#39;s also true that the statistic is also full of people that do day trading or that simply panic sell every 6 months, right?</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m also curious to hear from people that have invested far longer than me; how&#39;s it going for you?</p>\n\n<p>Also, one more thing: funnily enough, 99% of the people that say to simply invest in the S&amp;P 500, are not even doing it themselves, and they&#39;re actually buying lots of individual stocks... and making lots of money. Isn&#39;t that ironic?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ldzbms/arent_you_tired_of_people_saying_just_invest_in/","title":"Aren't you tired of people saying \"just invest in the S&P 500\"?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-06T19:37:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-06 19:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ldzbms","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldzbms/arent_you_tired_of_people_saying_just_invest_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldzbms/arent_you_tired_of_people_saying_just_invest_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Kayters","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kayters","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Kayters","score":46,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你不厌烦别人说 \"投资标普500就好 \"吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我经常听到有人说：\"只要投资标普500指数就可以了，忘记了。\n反正你永远也打不过它\"（特别是在R/investing中\n[/r/investing]），有时候我觉得挺悲哀的。我知道，大多数人都是\n可能只是说，因为他们不希望任何人失去... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你不厭煩別人說 \"投資標普500就好 \"嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我經常聽到有人說：\"只要投資標普500指數就可以了，忘記了。\n反正你永遠也打不過它\"（特別是在R/investing中\n[/r/investing]），有時候我覺得挺悲哀的。我知道，大多數人都是\n可能只是說，因爲他們不希望任何人失去... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lkvzj7","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkvzj7/someone_help_please/","title":"Someone help please 🤯","date":"February 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"谁来帮帮我吧 🤯。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"誰來幫幫我吧 🤯。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ll2vl1","excerpt":"Palantir 2020 Results:\n\n * $1.1 billion in revenue for full year 2020, up 47% year-over-year\n * $322 million in revenue for Q4 2020, up 40% year-over-year\n * Expects Q1 2021 revenue growth of 45% year-over-year\n\nQ4 EPS $(0.08) Misses $0.02 Estimate, Sales $322.00M Beat $300.74M…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll2vl1/palantir_reports_revenue_growth_of_47_for_full/","title":"Palantir Reports Revenue Growth of 47% for Full Year 2020, Expects Q1 2021 Revenue Growth of 45%","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 16, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Palantir报告2020年全年收入增长47%，预计2021年第一季度收入增长45%。","the_new_excerpt":"Palantir 2020年业绩。\n\n * 2020年全年收入11亿美元，同比增长47%。\n * 2020年第四季度收入3.22亿美元，同比增长40%。\n *预计2021年第一季度收入将同比增长45%。\n\n第四季度EPS(0.08)元低于预期0.02元，销售额3.22亿元胜过3.074亿元...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Palantir報告2020年全年收入增長47%，預計2021年第一季度收入增長45%。","the_new_excerpt":"Palantir 2020年業績。\n\n * 2020年全年收入11億美元，同比增長47%。\n * 2020年第四季度收入3.22億美元，同比增長40%。\n *預計2021年第一季度收入將同比增長45%。\n\n第四季度EPS(0.08)元低於預期0.02元，銷售額3.22億元勝過3.074億元...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-ldzbms","previousId":"RedditPost-lkvzj7","nextId":"RedditPost-ll2vl1","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ldzbms/arent_you_tired_of_people_saying_just_invest_in/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
