The company has had no bad news. The stock has a price target of $54. XPENG stock has been hammered down lately due to the lock up period which expires tomorrow. Earnings is on 8 March. $38 seems like an excellent buying opportunity to me. I’ll be adding shares tomorrow near market close. Looks like an easy 10-20% gain in a matter of days/weeks.</p>\n\n<p>LI also looks like a great buy. Quarterly revenue has been seeing consistent growth and earnings is finally reaching break even. Li has also invested a lot of their assets back into the company and their total assets has seen a healthy growth within the last year. </p>\n\n<p>These 2 seemed bound for a pullback after their highs in November but now it seems they are oversold. Are these on anyone else’s watch list ? Anything I should be weary of?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lq1j24/xpeng_set_to_run/","title":"XPENG set to run?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T06:55:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 06:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lq1j24","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lq1j24/xpeng_set_to_run/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lq1j24/xpeng_set_to_run/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"theepicone111","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/theepicone111","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"theepicone111","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"XPENG设置运行？","the_new_excerpt":"XPENG在11月24日陡然上涨后，最高见74.49美元。自那时起\n现在回落到38美元--跌幅达50%。该公司没有坏消息。该\nXPENG的目标股价为54美元。\n到明天到期的锁定期。盈利是在8...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"XPENG設置運行？","the_new_excerpt":"XPENG在11月24日陡然上漲後，最高見74.49美元。自那時起\n現在回落到38美元--跌幅達50%。該公司沒有壞消息。該\nXPENG的目標股價爲54美元。\n到明天到期的鎖定期。盈利是在8...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1367581029511356420","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1367581029511356420","title":"The markets are closed. \n \n✦ S&amp;P 500 ▼ 1.34%                    \n✦ Nasdaq ▼ 2.11%                    \n✦ Russell 2K ▼ 2.76%                    \n✦ Dow Jones ▼ 1.11% https://t.co/jWXU9amZZc","date":"March 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"市场已经关闭。\n \nS&amp;P 500 ▼ 1.34％                    \n纳斯达克指数 ▼ 2.11%                    \n罗素 2K ▼ 2.76%。                   \n道琼斯 ▼ 1.11% https://t.co/jWXU9amZZc","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"市場已經關閉。\n \nS&amp;P 500 ▼ 1.34％                    \n納斯達克指數 ▼ 2.11%                    \n羅素 2K ▼ 2.76%。                   \n道瓊斯 ▼ 1.11% https://t.co/jWXU9amZZc","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26347380","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26347380","title":"100Mbps uploads and downloads should be US broadband standard, senators say","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 04, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"参议员称100Mbps上传和下载应成为美国宽带标准","locale":"zh"},{"title":"參議員稱100Mbps上傳和下載應成爲美國寬帶標準","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lq1j24","previousId":"TweetPost-1367581029511356420","nextId":"HnPost-26347380","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lq1j24/xpeng_set_to_run/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
