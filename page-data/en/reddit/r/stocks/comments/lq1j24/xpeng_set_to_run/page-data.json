The company has had no bad news. The stock has a price target of $54. XPENG stock has been hammered down lately due to the lock up period which expires tomorrow. Earnings is on 8 March. $38 seems like an excellent buying opportunity to me. I’ll be adding shares tomorrow near market close. Looks like an easy 10-20% gain in a matter of days/weeks.</p>\n\n<p>LI also looks like a great buy. Quarterly revenue has been seeing consistent growth and earnings is finally reaching break even. Li has also invested a lot of their assets back into the company and their total assets has seen a healthy growth within the last year. </p>\n\n<p>These 2 seemed bound for a pullback after their highs in November but now it seems they are oversold. Are these on anyone else’s watch list ?
