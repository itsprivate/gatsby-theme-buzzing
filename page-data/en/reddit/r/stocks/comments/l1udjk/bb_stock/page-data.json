My thought is it could increase 10 fold from current price once people know about their future. They are number one OEM provider for the EV and their cyber security software outclasses everything in the market. It will pop to 50 in no time. Please do some research and make your decision. If CRWD have a mkt CAP of 50B I see BB can reach 50B within next year.</p>\n\n<p>Current MKT CAP -7 B</p>\n\n<p>POS- 12.7</p>\n\n<p>My projection is after people know about the company</p>\n\n<p>MKT CAP - 50B</p>\n\n<p>POS $80 at the end of 2021</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now say market crashes. But BB surely will not drop because of their pipeline. Maybe go to $8-10 for a short term this month but I don&#39;t see it coming because word is spreading and people are coming to know about the potential of Blackberry.
