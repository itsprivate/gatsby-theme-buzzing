We have pioneered a novel paradigm for delivering molecules typically administered parenterally, where the inconvenience and pain associated with subcutaneous, intravenous or other complex administrations present barriers to compliance. Our strengths lie in our diverse team of industry veterans with proven drug and device development and significant commercialization experience.</p>\n\n<h1>Their staple product:</h1>\n\n<h1>Intracutaneous Microneedle System</h1>\n\n<h2>What is the intracutaneous microneedle system?</h2>\n\n<p>The system is a single-entity combination product, which comprises a reusable applicator and a microneedle array containing patch, for intracutaneous drug delivery allowing rapid absorption into the bloodstream. The microneedle array patch is applied to the skin using a ready to use and reusable handheld applicator.</p>\n\n<p>Each microneedle array patch is individually packaged and stored at room temperature. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n\n<p>An array of close to two thousand drug-coated titanium microneedles is mounted on the skin-facing surface of a backing that resembles an adhesive bandage. The length of each individual microneedle is about 3 times the width of a human hair. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>When the microneedle patch is applied, the microneedles penetrate the outermost layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum). The shallow depth of penetration limits the likelihood of stimulating sensory nerve endings and causing pain. Interstitial fluid in the skin reconstitutes the drug and makes it available for rapid absorption into the bloodstream.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h2>What are the advantages of intracutaneous delivery?</h2>\n\n<h2>Rapid Systemic Delivery without the Needle</h2>\n\n<p>There are instances where a drug cannot or should not be administered orally. For example, some drugs have poor oral bioavailability. In other cases, patients may not be able to tolerate an orally administered drug. In addition, intestinal absorption following oral delivery can be slow, delaying the beneficial effects of a drug.</p>\n\n<p>Intracutaneous delivery allows systemic drug delivery without the use of a hypodermic needle. In clinical studies, less than 10% of patients reported any pain at the application site. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated ~ 3-times faster absorption of zolmitriptan using our system compared with orally administered zolmitriptan.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>They&#39;re currently using this technology on a soon-to-be FDA approved Migrane treatment.</p>\n\n<p>But here&#39;s the kicker, and why I think this stock has the potential to 10x...</p>\n\n<p>They recently announced they&#39;re looking for a partner to use this amazing technology to help administer the COVID vaccine, at home.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I think this stock has major potential to grow, with or without the COVID vaccine.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lfso18/nasdaq_zsan_zosano_pharma_corp_the_covid_stock/","title":"NASDAQ: $ZSAN - Zosano Pharma Corp. - The COVID stock with major UPSIDE Potential!","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T06:22:44.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 06:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lfso18","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lfso18/nasdaq_zsan_zosano_pharma_corp_the_covid_stock/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lfso18/nasdaq_zsan_zosano_pharma_corp_the_covid_stock/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"SR_Achilles_VI","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SR_Achilles_VI","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"SR_Achilles_VI","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"纳斯达克：$ZSAN - Zosano Pharma Corp.--具有重大UPSIDE潜力的COVID股票!","the_new_excerpt":"(昨天中午股价有所回升--我们将迎来一个好星期。跳上\n(C/P)\n\n(C/P)\n\n * 这不是财务建议，请在购买股票前做你自己的丈量。\n   任何股票 *\n\n\nZOSANO PHARMA CORP.\n\n\n$ZSAN 在纳斯达克\n\n\n\n什么是众生诺？\n\n众生药业是一家临床阶段...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"納斯達克：$ZSAN - Zosano Pharma Corp.--具有重大UPSIDE潛力的COVID股票!","the_new_excerpt":"(昨天中午股價有所回升--我們將迎來一個好星期。跳上\n(C/P)\n\n(C/P)\n\n * 這不是財務建議，請在購買股票前做你自己的丈量。\n   任何股票 *\n\n\nZOSANO PHARMA CORP.\n\n\n$ZSAN 在納斯達克\n\n\n\n什麼是衆生諾？\n\n衆生藥業是一家臨牀階段...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26187881","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26187881","title":"Why is it so hard to see code from 5 minutes ago?","date":"February 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么5分钟前的代码这么难看？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼5分鐘前的代碼這麼難看？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26185005","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26185005","title":"Python 3.x: RCE in Python applications that accept floats as untrusted input","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 19, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Python 3.x: RCE在Python应用程序中接受floats作为不信任的输入。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Python 3.x: RCE在Python應用程序中接受floats作爲不信任的輸入。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lfso18","previousId":"HnPost-26187881","nextId":"HnPost-26185005","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lfso18/nasdaq_zsan_zosano_pharma_corp_the_covid_stock/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
