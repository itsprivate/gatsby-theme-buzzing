But lets he honest, unless you had a clear exit strategy, why would you have?</p>\n\n<p>This was riding to $500 with so much momentum, it was about to once again hit every strike in the chain as ITM probably initiating another crazy Gamma Squeeze which really could have set off the MOASS. Then we know how the rest played out. Buying restrictions really destroyed all volume and momentum. But then there was the hype and Friday was back up. Truth be told, noone knew what would happen at week end. This was such a dynamic and unique situation. <strong>Unique</strong>. As in - in no way related or could be extrapolated from VW.</p>\n\n<p>A friend told me over the weekend that he tried to short them at open Thursday. I straight told him that was dumb. <em>Just because in hindsight it was right, at the time it wasn&#39;t</em>. No one knew what would happen midmorning that effectively destroyed all buy side momentum and left the sell side wide open. Not to mention the hype then built on Thursday going into Friday by politicians, activists, billionaires... Then going into the weekend, news was splattered all over on every spectrum.</p>\n\n<p>I know /Investing and /Stocks are generally not into this mentality. But I&#39;m just saying, this was nothing like a normal trading situation for the majority of people. Everyone risked what they could risk to &#39;go to the moon&#39;. Can&#39;t beat yourself up for treating a gamble like a gamble. People jumping late were buying lotto tickets for a MOASS. Sad to say, it happened and got cut short with Thursday&#39;s actions, at least that&#39;s what I think.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, we all have to open our eyes to our own DD. By mid Monday I figured what was happening but held on just to see if there&#39;s any new momentum. There wasn&#39;t. I started really looking at the volume and stock movements, and you see how it dipped and rode back up daily - that could have indeed be covering. Trust your own gut when you need to. Don&#39;t take everything they say to heart - (such as the SSR and the incorrect way they were posting it. Same as the T+2, noone knows if and when they covered). Always remember - Other people&#39;s DD whether good or not, have personal biases, and this includes media outlets and analysts.</p>\n\n<p>And just remember, a lot of the early adopters are holding because they believe in GME, not necessary just the squeeze. And made money along the way. There is nothing wrong with joining the ride or allocating an X% of your portfolio for risky plays. But understand what comes with that risk. <strong>There is also nothing wrong with taking profits or cutting loose when suits you and your own financial situation.</strong></p>\n\n<p>And I do think this was a great lesson for all of us, novice to experienced on how to handle FOMO, Risk, Greed, Emotion, Wall Street and the slew of everything else. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Decisions are always easier in Hindsight. Doesn&#39;t mean they were the right decision at the time.</strong> Remember that. And don&#39;t beat yourself up on it. Take it and learn from it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lbhzsc/decisions_are_always_easier_in_hindsight_the_meme/","title":"Decisions are always easier in hindsight.
