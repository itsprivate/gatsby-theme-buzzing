thoughts:\n<strong>Apple (APPL)</strong> brings the premium brand name, <strong>Hyundai-Kia (GDR)</strong> brings the automotive industry experience, distribution, and maybe some marketing, <strong>Canoo (GOEV)</strong> brings their B2B skateboard EV platform/ hardware, and <strong>Blackberry (BB)</strong> will play a significant role in the software/ tech security with their QNX system.
