Non-farm payrolls rose by 379,000 in February, or well above the 200,000 expected. The unemployment rate dipped to 6.2%, unexpectedly improving compared to January&#39;s 6.3%. The February jobs report also included a notable upward revision to payroll. January’s payroll gain was revised up to 166,000 from the tepid 49,000 previously reported.</p>\n\n<p>In response to the positive jobs reports, Treasury yields rose once again to hover near its one-year high. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a high of 1.6% today before dipping to 1.557% at the time of writing. As a reminder, high expectations of economic growth causes Treasury yields to rise as the demand for bonds drops in order to make them more attractive. </p>\n\n<p>Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today&#39;s dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.</p>\n\n<p>During a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be “patient” in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, “If we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.”</p>\n\n<p>Texas said Tuesday that it was lifting its mask requirement and would allow businesses to fully reopen, the most expansive step by any state to remove coronavirus restrictions as Americans across the country are eager to emerge after a year of isolation in the pandemic. </p>\n\n<p>Senate Democrats struck a last-minute agreement Friday to set federal unemployment benefits at $300 a week, down from the $400 passed by the House, but extend their duration by more than a month as part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, according to a Democratic aide. Democrats hope to pass the bill before the mid-March cliff where enhanced federal unemployment benefits from the previous relief package expire. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Popular online brokerage Robinhood<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/robinhood-chooses-the-nasdaq-for-its-ipo-sources-say.html\"> has selected the Nasdaq over the New York Stock Exchange</a> for its eventual initial public offering, CNBC reported Friday, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.</li>\n<li>General Electric has been outperforming the market on bets a corporate turnaround and broader economic recovery will boost the manufacturing giant.
