I am a college student working part time. I love the company and the software services they provide. I am still somewhat new to the concept of things being priced in already. Do you all think this is the case? Would it be wise to wait and see how PLTR trades after the demo today? I have a decently diversified portfolio already and I can definitely afford to lose this $200 worst case.
