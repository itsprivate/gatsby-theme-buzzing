The same echo chamber phenomenon. </p>\n\n<p>Yes, some sort of delta squeezing happened yesterday. Lots of nice DD posts out there.</p>\n\n<p>Still, we could perhaps guess that on 02/26 those call options might be squozen.</p>\n\n<p>Or... it could not happen.</p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t know the delta on those calls, maybe they sold them real cheap when GME was at 200, just to hedge. We also don&#39;t know if they are covered or naked calls.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s clear that redditors money is not moving the needle and that the spike was caused either by covering shorts or call options being delta-hedged. In any case, don&#39;t be reassured by other people buying. Accept a squeeze like yesterday&#39;s can happen, but <strong>it&#39;s completely out of your control or other redditors&#39;. So TRADE ONLY WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Right now WSB is <em>again</em> showcasing posts of people putting their life savings on GME near the top, and <strong>not a single comment with a hard, concise, word of caution.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s just sad at this point. </p>\n\n<p><strong>I&#39;ve got my 2 shares in</strong>. Idgaf, I can hold. <strong>But I might just as well sell at 150, 200, 300</strong> and buy something nice for a member of my family with the free cash. Realize that is the case with a lot of people.</p>\n\n<p>There might be the possibilty of a historical squeeze and 10k, 50k, blah blah. But it&#39;s a possibility. It&#39;s not worth your life savings and your loved ones wellbeing. What if there still is a lot to squeeze yet, but funds keep repeating the cycle of bringing the price down for weeks? Are these people putting their entire savings in GME going to hold until then? No. They will panic and cash out with a loss.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: Only trade money that you can afford to lose. Herd mentality is very, very scary. Let&#39;s be responsible and award comments issuing caution, or report posts that show self-destructive financial behavior.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lskfoh/lets_please_remind_people_that_they_can_lose/","title":"Let's please remind people that they can lose everything on GME","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-26T04:08:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-26 04:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lskfoh","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lskfoh/lets_please_remind_people_that_they_can_lose/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lskfoh/lets_please_remind_people_that_they_can_lose/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"nmercado1986","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/nmercado1986","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"nmercado1986","score":243,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"让我们提醒大家，在GME上可以失去一切。","the_new_excerpt":"同样是WSB的从众心理。同样的回音室现象。\n\n是的，昨天发生了某种三角洲挤压现象。很多漂亮的DD帖子出来了\n在那里。\n\n不过，我们或许可以猜测，在02/26日，那些看涨期权可能会被挤爆。\n\n或者... 可能不会发生\n\n我们不知道这些期权的Delta... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"讓我們提醒大家，在GME上可以失去一切。","the_new_excerpt":"同樣是WSB的從衆心理。同樣的迴音室現象。\n\n是的，昨天發生了某種三角洲擠壓現象。很多漂亮的DD帖子出來了\n在那裏。\n\n不過，我們或許可以猜測，在02/26日，那些看漲期權可能會被擠爆。\n\n或者... 可能不會發生\n\n我們不知道這些期權的Delta... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lsojl2","excerpt":"While I think what happened to G-ME, was overall good retail investors.
