It opened my eyes, but actually, nothing happened. It was interesting, but no one around me had any clue about passive income, assets vs. liabilities and so on. My parents invested in some funds proposed by their bank, steady 2% pa. All they cared.</p>\n\n<p>In high school and at my uni, I had 1 subject about economics, but these classes were not engaging and most of us did the minimal effort as we thought that you can&#39;t have a business without money, we haven&#39;t been taught (if the wrong gramma sorry, it&#39;s my 2 language)  ANYTHING about passive income and how to get the most out of it.

The key idea of this thread is:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>To appreciate the high volume of new traders.</strong> I understand the frustration that suddenly all stock-related subreddits are flooded with dumb questions and low content threads. It is annoying when people keep asking if they should invest in stock x, y or z and spamming ( 🚀💎), Remember that hype will fade after some time, but 20-30% of these new investors will remain and start to learn!  Look at the bright side, more people = more trades = more gains/losses (😂), but also <strong>there is a chance that we increase the amount of financially literate people among this 90%!</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Collectivist is a good thing and in this case, we should share our wisdom, by giving resources or advice to new traders, while <strong>new traders should not expect straight answers (like sell or buy). That&#39;s not learning, but being lazy.</strong> There are already threads about being patient and helpful, so I am really grateful for those(Shout-out for the authors). Meme stocks promoted investing, which is beneficial for society as far as a society didn&#39;t invest all savings into this stocks this week xD</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>2) Past events, articles and my own financial illiteracy made me wonder - if really rich people &quot;keeping us poor&quot; or it is more about our society, that we are lazier and lazier? (insta gratification etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Or maybe that&#39;s the banks or government and their &quot;educational system&quot;?  Maybe, we are not meant to learn about finance, so we could be easy to control and follow our paychecks?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: Meme stocks had a good impact on society and I would like to know your thoughts why so many (poor) people do not understand finances are not willing to invest and who to blame?</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lckvn5/keep_them_poor_most_of_us_are_financially/","title":"Keep them poor - Most of us are financially illiterate?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T04:35:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 04:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lckvn5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lckvn5/keep_them_poor_most_of_us_are_financially/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lckvn5/keep_them_poor_most_of_us_are_financially/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Crowleyer","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Crowleyer","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Crowleyer","score":62,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"让他们保持贫穷--我们大多数人都是经济文盲？","the_new_excerpt":"> 我迈出了这第一步，第一次投资理财。\n>考虑到我是出身于非常贫困的家庭。- Anon Redditor\n\n我在/rstocks附近闲逛，发现了这个特别的句子，它给我带来了\n醍醐灌顶之感","locale":"zh"},{"title":"讓他們保持貧窮--我們大多數人都是經濟文盲？","the_new_excerpt":"> 我邁出了這第一步，第一次投資理財。\n>考慮到我是出身於非常貧困的家庭。- Anon Redditor\n\n我在/rstocks附近閒逛，發現了這個特別的句子，它給我帶來了\n醍醐灌頂之感","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lj5u19","excerpt":"Hey all, two weeks ago a DD was posted outlining a nationwide propane shortage.\nIt had not yet hit national news.
