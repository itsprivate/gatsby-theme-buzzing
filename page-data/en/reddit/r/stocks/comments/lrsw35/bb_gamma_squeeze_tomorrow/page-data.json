You are looking at 18,722 contracts open as of the close of trading today (i.e., Feb. 24).</p>\n\n<p>Given the sell-off in the NASDAQ this week, many hedge funds / others thought BB was going to stay under $11. (Look at the spike in open interest at $11). I bet a bunch of the options at $11 and above were written naked. If BB can close above $13 tomorrow, a boat load of call options will be in the money.
