T<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrsn56/bb_gamma_squeeze_tomorrow/\">ake a look at the open interest for calls expiring this Friday</a> (i.e., Feb. 26) at strike prices of $11.00, $11.50, and $12.00. You are looking at 18,722 contracts open as of the close of trading today (i.e., Feb. 24).</p>\n\n<p>Given the sell-off in the NASDAQ this week, many hedge funds / others thought BB was going to stay under $11. (Look at the spike in open interest at $11). I bet a bunch of the options at $11 and above were written naked. If BB can close above $13 tomorrow, a boat load of call options will be in the money. Friday could bring a gamma squeeze where BB really takes off.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lrsw35/bb_gamma_squeeze_tomorrow/","title":"$BB Gamma squeeze tomorrow??","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-25T02:32:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-25 02:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lrsw35","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrsw35/bb_gamma_squeeze_tomorrow/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrsw35/bb_gamma_squeeze_tomorrow/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"growthinvestor123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/growthinvestor123","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"growthinvestor123","score":594,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$BB伽马明天挤吗？","the_new_excerpt":"从图表上看，认为明天可能会看到BB的伽马压制。\n\n现在我打这个字的时候，BB的盘后价格是12.40元/股。这\n价格放置不少看涨期权的钱。看一看公开的\n兴趣的电话到期，这...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$BB伽馬明天擠嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"從圖表上看，認爲明天可能會看到BB的伽馬壓制。\n\n現在我打這個字的時候，BB的盤後價格是12.40元/股。這\n價格放置不少看漲期權的錢。看一看公開的\n興趣的電話到期，這...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1368188839139872775","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1368188839139872775","title":"RT @iancassel: A great sign of investment maturity is when you can buy a stock at a higher price that you passed on at a lower price.\nSomet…","date":"March 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @iancassel。投资成熟的一个很好的标志就是 你可以用更高的价格买到一只股票 而你用更低的价格买到了它。\n有些...","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"投资成熟的一个重要标志，就是你能以更高的价格买到一只在低价时转手的股票。\n有时候，一只股票在更高的价格上比在更低的价格上更好买。它需要时间来成熟，从投机发展到投资。"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @iancassel。投資成熟的一個很好的標誌就是 你可以用更高的價格買到一隻股票 而你用更低的價格買到了它。\n有些...","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"投資成熟的一個重要標誌，就是你能以更高的價格買到一隻在低價時轉手的股票。\n有時候，一隻股票在更高的價格上比在更低的價格上更好買。它需要時間來成熟，從投機發展到投資。"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lz3wty","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz3wty/rolled_59k_into_gme_shares_from_my_onlyfans/","title":"rolled 59k into GME shares from my onlyfans proceeds on CashApp 🦍 🌮 🚀","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 07, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"在CashApp上将我的onlyfans收益中的5.9万转为GME股票 🦍 🌮 🚀。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"在CashApp上將我的onlyfans收益中的5.9萬轉爲GME股票 🦍 🌮 🚀。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lrsw35","previousId":"TweetPost-1368188839139872775","nextId":"RedditPost-lz3wty","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lrsw35/bb_gamma_squeeze_tomorrow/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
