All his comment history had was 1000x shills of people who don&#39;t hold their pumped-up stock. People here upvoted their posts as if you agreed there was manipulation by hedge funds and bots, ironically being manipulated by people holding a certain stock that&#39;s being pumped and trying to bring down all other posts.</p>\n\n<p>Just be wary of where you get your information from. If someone is shilling or pumping a stock with not proper evidence apart from one link maybe have a peek at their previous comment&#39;s extremism.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l5pjym/coordinated_attacks_nok_shillers_today/","title":"Coordinated attacks - NOK shillers today","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-27T14:04:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-27 14:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l5pjym","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l5pjym/coordinated_attacks_nok_shillers_today/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l5pjym/coordinated_attacks_nok_shillers_today/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Dominatee","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dominatee","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Dominatee","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"有用户发布了他的 \"广泛 \"研究，他如何找到一个账号，这个账号是2。\n个月大，NOK如何是内幕。我发现这并不真实，因为我看了一下\n其他10个做NOK研究的人，他们都是老...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"有用戶發佈了他的 \"廣泛 \"研究，他如何找到一個賬號，這個賬號是2。\n個月大，NOK如何是內幕。我發現這並不真實，因爲我看了一下\n其他10個做NOK研究的人，他們都是老...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lcgvrd","excerpt":"I've had my fun and my loss porn.
