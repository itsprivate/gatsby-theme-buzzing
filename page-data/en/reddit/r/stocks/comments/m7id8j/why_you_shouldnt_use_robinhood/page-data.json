Oh, right, they make money from order flow... that means their real customer is Citadel.</p>\n\n<p>What does that make retail investors?  The product.  Just like FB and others, you are essentially the product that is being pawned around, except in this case, you have your own dollars at stake.</p>\n\n<p>Is this necessarily bad?  Depends.  But if you are not their customer, you are likely not getting the attention you deserve as an investor.  The sleek look and ease to use is just to make the product more lucrative for their actual clients.</p>\n\n<p>Also, it’s a tech company, not a financial services company.  Not inherently a bad thing, but a company who’s core competency is software development, and not equities trading, I’d think twice.</p>\n\n<p>IRA?  Sorry.  I haven’t looked into why specifically, but it likely doesn’t generate the same money as a brokerage account.  If you were actually RH’s customer, why wouldn’t they offer you one of the best and most trusted retirement vehicles in this country?</p>\n\n<p>Customer Service - never used it, but again, it’s a tech company... when have you ever got on the phone with google?</p>\n\n<p>Leadership - the congressional hearings were pathetic... what is core to leadership?  Seeking responsibility for your actions.  This ceo needs to hire someone else to be the point man, he isn’t ready for the big leagues.</p>\n\n<p>Many more points, but I’m getting angry just typing this.  Let’s keep brewing the hate.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m7id8j/why_you_shouldnt_use_robinhood/","title":"Why you shouldn’t use Robinhood","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-18T05:25:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-18 05:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m7id8j","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7id8j/why_you_shouldnt_use_robinhood/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7id8j/why_you_shouldnt_use_robinhood/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"crazyk2007","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/crazyk2007","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"crazyk2007","score":7245,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么您不应该使用Robinhood","the_new_excerpt":"我已经看到了一大堆的帖子，从新的投资者使用什么经纪公司，我\n想清楚为什么不应该使用RH。\n\n他们的客户是谁，他们的产品是什么？\n\nRH会说，客户就是你，散户......但客户难道不\n给钱买服务？ - 哦，对，他们让... 哦，对了，他们让...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼您不應該使用Robinhood","the_new_excerpt":"我已經看到了一大堆的帖子，從新的投資者使用什麼經紀公司，我\n想清楚爲什麼不應該使用RH。\n\n他們的客戶是誰，他們的產品是什麼？\n\nRH會說，客戶就是你，散戶......但客戶難道不\n給錢買服務？ - 哦，對，他們讓... 哦，對了，他們讓...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m7enz7","excerpt":"Hi all\n\nLong story short I am feeling particularly bullish on the future of green\nhydrogen and fuel cell technology.\n\nI have been putting together a pie to expose myself to as much of the industry\nas possible, please let me know if I am missing, or you would suggest any\nstocks?\n\nCurrently…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m7enz7/hydrogen_stocks/","title":"Hydrogen stocks","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"氢气储存","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n长话短说，我感觉特别看好绿色环保的未来。\n氢气和燃料电池技术。\n\n我一直在画饼，让自己尽可能多地接触这个行业。\n如果我有遗漏，请告诉我，或者你会提出任何建议。\n股票？\n\n目前...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"氫氣儲存","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n長話短說，我感覺特別看好綠色環保的未來。\n氫氣和燃料電池技術。\n\n我一直在畫餅，讓自己儘可能多地接觸這個行業。\n如果我有遺漏，請告訴我，或者你會提出任何建議。\n股票？\n\n目前...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m7h6uv","excerpt":"Hi all 👋🏻.
