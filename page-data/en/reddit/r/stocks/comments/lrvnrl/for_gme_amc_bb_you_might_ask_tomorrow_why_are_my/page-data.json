They&#39;ll be like wtf? This happens because one of the greeks is called Vega which controls options prices based on implied volatility changes.</p>\n\n<p>When IV increases significantly, prices for both calls and puts also increase by a large amount because an increase in vega positively correlates with an increase in prices irrespective of whether it&#39;s a call or put.</p>\n\n<p>Another tip. If you really like the $GME company, you can sell far out of the money puts tomorrow (cash secured puts) for extremely high premiums. That gives you an extremely low risk and high reward.
