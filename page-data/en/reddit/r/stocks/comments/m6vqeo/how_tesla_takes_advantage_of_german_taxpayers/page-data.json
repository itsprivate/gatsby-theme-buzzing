Tesla offered customers in Germany to buy back their recently purchased vehicle (half a year old) at a very high price if they bought the new model. In one example, this went so far that the <strong>customer received €3000 net for buying a new car</strong> (because of the high environmental bonus). (<a href=\"https://teslamag.de/news/verkaufsoffensive-tesla-deutschland-hohe-restwert-angebote-lieferung-nach-hause-34929\">https://teslamag.de/news/verkaufsoffensive-tesla-deutschland-hohe-restwert-angebote-lieferung-nach-hause-34929</a>)</p>\n\n<p>After several investigations and further articles published on this topic, the following is now clear: Tesla takes the car in part-exchange and sells it used (often abroad) at a good price, while the new car bought brings again 6000€ in environmental bonuses. So the <strong>German taxpayer has paid 12000€ tax money for a used Model 3 and a new Model 3, one of which will probably end up in Denmark</strong> or something, and Tesla has increased its official sales figure.

You can call it smart what Tesla is doing here, helping itself to German taxpayers&#39; money through these tricks <strong>after billions of euros in funding for the factory</strong> in Germany. However, it&#39;s not the decent thing to do, and that says enough about Tesla for me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m6vqeo/how_tesla_takes_advantage_of_german_taxpayers/","title":"How Tesla takes advantage of German taxpayers' money","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T11:14:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 11:14","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m6vqeo","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6vqeo/how_tesla_takes_advantage_of_german_taxpayers/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6vqeo/how_tesla_takes_advantage_of_german_taxpayers/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"GordonGekkoVienna","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GordonGekkoVienna","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"GordonGekkoVienna","score":1397,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"特斯拉如何利用德国纳税人的钱？","the_new_excerpt":"几天前，我写了一篇文章，质疑特斯拉的做法。特斯拉提出\n德国的客户可以回购他们最近购买的车辆（半年）。\n旧款），如果他们买了新款，价格就会非常高。在一个例子中，这\n竟然让客户收到了3000欧元的净买新车......。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉如何利用德國納稅人的錢？","the_new_excerpt":"幾天前，我寫了一篇文章，質疑特斯拉的做法。特斯拉提出\n德國的客戶可以回購他們最近購買的車輛（半年）。\n舊款），如果他們買了新款，價格就會非常高。在一個例子中，這\n竟然讓客戶收到了3000歐元的淨買新車......。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m6i91b","excerpt":"So you had a bad day.
