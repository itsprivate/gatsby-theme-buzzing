We are building it.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n<li>GME now has an inflated valuation .. yes. They will use it to expand and acquire smaller businesses and hire people.. Real economical progress</li>\n<li>They can now pay their debts to creditors</li>\n<li>Individual investors will use their profits to pay their credit card bills, buy a house, buy something.. The money is inside the market.</li>\n<li>Individual investors from all over the world will use their profits to invest in other companies that will increase in value and expand.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>We invest differently, They don&#39;t like it</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We are young passionate people with our own ideas. We don&#39;t share the same investment routine and style of older generations. We invest in a better future.. We invest in clean energy, Electric vehicles. We don&#39;t invest in shorting small business and crushing peoples dreams</li>\n<li>We don&#39;t play by the wall street rules. We make our own research and our own analysis. we don&#39;t count on the analysis of biased analysts telling us how to invest. They are losing influence and that&#39;s why they are fighting us.</li>\n<li>They benefit from our greed and we also were just benefiting from theirs. They have been making money out of the greed of some of us or sometimes the poor research we do regarding certain investments. We found their greed and we took advantage of it. We are actually doing SEC a favor by exposing the weaknesses of the system.</li>\n<li>We don&#39;t need guidance on how to invest. We are mature people and we know the risk of what we are doing. They allowed retail investors to invest in companies with no products or employees.. some of these companies reached 55Bn in market cap.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>More to add</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Why was Blackberry included in the restrictions?
