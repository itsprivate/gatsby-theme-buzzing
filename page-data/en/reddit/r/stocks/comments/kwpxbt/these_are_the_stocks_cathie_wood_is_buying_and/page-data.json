We soon came to realize that most of our work was completely the same as <a href=\"https://www.cathiesark.com\">www.cathiesark.com</a> , but we have since then added the change in amount of shares YTD, in each individual stock. This is to get an overview of what stocks are being added continuosly, so we can spot some of the opportunities that Cathie Wood and her team are seeing in the market, and which they no longer see (example: slowly selling out of EXONE CO/THE for several days). The changes in amount of shares are gathered from the email subscription from ARK, which is then added to the sheet and compared to the amount of shares owned in the individual companies at 12/30/2020. </p>\n\n<p>Besides these changed in positions, there are also added completely new companies in the ETF’s - you can see those in the sheet, with a comment “NEWLY ADDED” far right</p>\n\n<p>All the information below is from the google sheets, link at the bottom.</p>\n\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<h1>TOP 5 INCREASED POSITIONS:</h1>\n\n<ol>\n<li>SAREPTA THERAPEUTICS +359.25% <em>(weight in ARKG now: 1.03%)</em></li>\n<li>MAGNA INTERNATIONAL +228.67% <em>(weight in ARKQ now: 1.51%)</em></li>\n<li>BAIDU INC +134.12% <em>(avg. weight now: 2.82%) (newly added to ARKW)</em></li>\n<li>10X GENOMICS INC CLASS-A +117.97% <em>(avg. weight now: 0.78%) (newly added to ARKK)</em></li>\n<li>REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS +68.93% <em>(avg. weight now: 1.97%) (newly added to ARKK)</em><br/></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>TOP 5 DECREASED POSITIONS:</h1>\n\n<ol>\n<li>FLIR SYSTEMS -69.22% <em>(weight in ARKQ now: 1.28%)</em></li>\n<li>EXONE CO/THE -42.80% <em>(weight in ARKQ now: 0.72%) (recently removed from ARKK)</em></li>\n<li>TESLA INC -16.16% <em>(avg. weight now: 10.44%)</em></li>\n<li>TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR -13.51% <em>(avg. weight now: 1.76%)</em></li>\n<li>SPLUNK INC -11.13% <em>(avg. weight now: 0.86%)</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><em>(The change in % is meant to represent the change in shares owned.</em><br/>\n<em>Example: if there&#39;s 1000 TSLA stocks owned, and another 1000 are added, then that&#39;s a 100% increase.)</em></p>\n\n<p><em>(“avg. weight” represents the average weight in the ETF’s that is holding the stock.)</em></p>\n\n<p>(<em>All shares, from all the main five ETF&#39;s, have been added in this comparison.)</em></p>\n\n<p>Link for sheet with data: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EEywCKauljHmqIqABdyyRdmRizqzGrACJOm9pzHjmXc/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EEywCKauljHmqIqABdyyRdmRizqzGrACJOm9pzHjmXc/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n\n<p>If you mark the headers, you are able to rank the stocks by pressing the sort &amp; filter button on PC and create a temporary filter.
