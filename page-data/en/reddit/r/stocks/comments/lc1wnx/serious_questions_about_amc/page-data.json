I didn&#39;t invest money I can&#39;t afford to lose thought I did put in a reasonable amount. I even convinced some other people to jump in with me believing it would be the next GME. Needless to say I have lost money but I still believe in the cause and I still think it will make money at least in the long run so I am currently holding.</p>\n\n<p>The more I read, the more I believed in the cause. So first I want to talk about the things that have me convinced, although I know most of this comes from what people are referring to as &#39;an echo chamber&#39;:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbagpn/2221_blackrock_discloses_owning_62m_shares_of_amc/\">black rock has gotten in the fray with a huge investment</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/barstools-portnoy-invests-amc-stock-losing-700k-gamestop\">Dave Portnoy</a> jumped in again after posting about pulling his previous meme stock.</li>\n<li>I keep seeing the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PalpitationSimilar67/comments/lar78f/amc_amcstock_hold/\">same sentiment thrown around of WHY</a> we are doing this</li>\n<li>Accusations of short laddering and naked shorting I (Cant post YouTube link because mods) are thrown around, while others here say its actually just normal and people on WSB are being delusional</li>\n<li>On top of this we get to stick it to the hedge funds during a time when wealth inequality is unparalleled in the country, what&#39;s not to like?</li>\n<li>I actually do believe in this stock I think theatres will come back after the vaccine and their reopening.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As someone completely new and here during an unprecedented time, this is alot to take in for me.</p>\n\n<p>I began to realize just how many people believe in this, and was kinda dumb struck when I realized they might all be being played. Myself included. Next I want to talk about the reasons I feel like I should worry:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>GME and AMC fell off a cliff on Monday. Are people really losing interest? It seems to me like the movement is gaining momentum. What IS going on? Is it <em>really</em> market manipulation?</li>\n<li>A reddit post from here earlier today, talking about the SEC was investigating people. Not anyone from WSB, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbyve5/clarifying_the_secs_investigation_of_social_media/\">but someone who may have used the frenzy to manipulate people on social media</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Clearly nobody knows what&#39;s actually going on since it seems no outlet can truly be trusted, but I would like to hear from anyone not spamming rocket ship emojis who feel like you have an actual stance on this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lc1wnx/serious_questions_about_amc/","title":"Serious questions about AMC","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-04T06:24:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-04 06:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lc1wnx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lc1wnx/serious_questions_about_amc/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lc1wnx/serious_questions_about_amc/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"presidentsenpai","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/presidentsenpai","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"presidentsenpai","score":91,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"关于AMC的严重问题","the_new_excerpt":"所以不用说，我也相信了炒作，吃尽了苦头。我没有投资\n我不能失去的钱，以为我确实投入了合理的金额。我甚至\n说服了其他一些人和我一起加入，相信这将是下一个。\nGME。不用说我已经亏损了，但我还是相信... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於AMC的嚴重問題","the_new_excerpt":"所以不用說，我也相信了炒作，吃盡了苦頭。我沒有投資\n我不能失去的錢，以爲我確實投入了合理的金額。我甚至\n說服了其他一些人和我一起加入，相信這將是下一個。\nGME。不用說我已經虧損了，但我還是相信... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lhpiba","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhpiba/paperhands_strike_again/","title":"Paperhands strike again","date":"February 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"纸手们再次出击","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"紙手們再次出擊","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-li4got","excerpt":"Listen I’ll be honest with you all.
