This is a multiple of about 50 times the current price. If the price happens to spike that high (it almost certainly won&#39;t), I&#39;ll get $100,000 per share. They&#39;re comfortable doing this, because they probably actually have the shares. Or they feel like they can get them when it happens.</p>\n\n<p>However, they are only willing to let me put a limit of about $250 per share for GME. This is a multiple of only 5x.</p>\n\n<p>They give errors for any attempt to put limit sells higher than this. Why are they treating GME limit sells differently from Google? I have a cash account. There should be no share lending going on. The broker should not be at risk for ANY limit I put on the sale of my shares.</p>\n\n<p>The only conclusion I have been able to draw from this is: They must not actually have all of our shares and are limiting their losses. Try it with any other stock: LIMITS ARE 50x, and as far as I can tell, have always been until GME.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: In my cash account:</p>\n\n<p>1) TD allows Google (and many other stocks) limit sell orders to be placed at about 50x the price.</p>\n\n<p>2) GME limit sell orders can be placed at only about 5x the price.</p>\n\n<p>What gives?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/","title":"I strongly suspect that Schwab/Ameritrade does not actually have our GME shares.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-20T09:42:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-20 09:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lnvero","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Fragsworth","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fragsworth","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Fragsworth","score":527,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1366744479135391744","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1366744479135391744","title":"President Biden will announce later Tuesday that Merck &amp; Co. will help make Johnson &amp; Johnson's one-shot COVID-19 vaccine in an unusual agreement between two competitors that could lead to a significant boost in supply, the Washington Post reported. $JNJ https://t.co/avxTv8aJLI https://t.co/2dAorcqFix","date":"March 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"据华盛顿邮报报道，总统拜登将在周二晚些时候宣布，默克公司将帮助生产强生公司的一针COVID-19疫苗，这是两个竞争对手之间的一项不同寻常的协议，可能会导致供应量大幅增加。$JNJ https://t.co/avxTv8aJLI https://t.co/2dAorcqFix","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"據華盛頓郵報報道，總統拜登將在週二晚些時候宣佈，默克公司將幫助生產強生公司的一針COVID-19疫苗，這是兩個競爭對手之間的一項不同尋常的協議，可能會導致供應量大幅增加。$JNJ https://t.co/avxTv8aJLI https://t.co/2dAorcqFix","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lw34hk","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw34hk/when_you_claim_to_be_the_hero_of_retail_investors/","title":"When you claim to be the hero of retail investors but you’re really a villain.....😒","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 02, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"当你口口声声说自己是散户的英雄，但其实是个小人.....😒。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"當你口口聲聲說自己是散戶的英雄，但其實是個小人.....😒。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lnvero","previousId":"TweetPost-1366744479135391744","nextId":"RedditPost-lw34hk","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
