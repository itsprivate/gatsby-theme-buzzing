He&#39;s consistently preached about investing in good companies with great management or investing in within your circle of competence. Sure, he&#39;s missed out on the tech boom, but results are results. His teachings span across all generations and his quirky teachings make investing seem so simple. </p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re now in an environment that many say is a bubble (though that&#39;s been the case for 20 years), uncertainty about the FED artificially inflating the price of stocks, and an army of young investors YOLOing it all on garbage companies, perhaps exploiting how easily the market can be manipulated. But for Buffett, the dude just grabs his McDonalds sandwich each morning, heads to work, sucks down a Coke, and reads for like 8 hours...completely ignoring all the noise. Why? He&#39;s invested in good companies with good management. </p>\n\n<p>So assuming you could only invest in 6 stocks, (1 of which is completely speculative just for fun) and TOMORROW the markets shut down for 10 years, which companies would you invest in TODAY?</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s my list in the order from highest to lowest portfolio %</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Google</li>\n<li>Disney</li>\n<li>Amazon</li>\n<li>AT&amp;T</li>\n<li>Coke</li>\n<li>* Canoo ($GOEV)</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kyyufq/if_the_markets_shut_down_tomorrow_for_10_years/","title":"If the Markets Shut Down Tomorrow for 10 years, What Would You Invest in Today? - A Buffett Exercise","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-17T10:23:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-17 10:23","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kyyufq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kyyufq/if_the_markets_shut_down_tomorrow_for_10_years/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kyyufq/if_the_markets_shut_down_tomorrow_for_10_years/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Mr_JerryS","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mr_JerryS","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Mr_JerryS","score":60,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果明天市场关闭10年，你今天会投资什么？- 巴菲特练习","the_new_excerpt":"\"只有在市场关闭时，你才会很高兴地买下一些你会持有的东西\n下了10年。\"\n\n正如大咖喜欢指出的，投资并不复杂。他是\n一贯宣扬投资于管理优秀的好公司或\n在你的能力范围内投资....","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果明天市場關閉10年，你今天會投資什麼？- 巴菲特練習","the_new_excerpt":"\"只有在市場關閉時，你纔會很高興地買下一些你會持有的東西\n下了10年。\"\n\n正如大咖喜歡指出的，投資並不複雜。他是\n一貫宣揚投資於管理優秀的好公司或\n在你的能力範圍內投資....","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l60euz","excerpt":"This is my Michael Burry moment.\n\nIt all starts with Melvin Capital.
