I figured I had money i was willing to risk using &lt;5% of my portfolio and I fortunately got in at $94 last Monday.</p>\n\n<p>I was seeing 3-4x gains throughout the week and I definitely got caught up in everyone else’s euphoria at WSB saying to diamond hand it to $1k. Looking back, I should have followed DFV’s footsteps last week and start locking in profits on the way up. While I’ve already learned years ago to not FOMO and buy high, I learned this week that unrealized gains are WORTHLESS and you shouldn’t hold the bag for too long. </p>\n\n<p>I still got out green and it was only &lt;5% of my portfolio. I know some people have it worse by putting in way more than they can afford to lose, but I didn’t realize how emotionally invested I would be and how bummed I would still feel for letting the crazy 3x gains slip away using. Unless the money was life changing, it wasn’t worth the emotional roller coaster IMO. </p>\n\n<p>Lessons I learned:\n-Lock in profits as soon as you start feeling euphoric from the gains</p>\n\n<p>-Don’t let other people influence your decisions </p>\n\n<p>-GET OUT once the hype train gets in</p>\n\n<p>If you guys have any other tips, please let me know!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/law5ka/things_i_learned_from_last_weeks_chaos/","title":"Things I learned from last weeks chaos","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T19:07:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 19:07","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"law5ka","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/law5ka/things_i_learned_from_last_weeks_chaos/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/law5ka/things_i_learned_from_last_weeks_chaos/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"jabilas","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jabilas","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"jabilas","score":209,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我从上周的混乱中学到的东西","the_new_excerpt":"我在过去的4年里一直在做美元成本平均法，我决定给它加点料。\n上周，我跳上了GME的火车。我想我有钱，我愿意\n冒着使用<5%的投资组合的风险，我很幸运地在上周一94美元进入。\n\n我看到整个星期有3-4倍的收益，我绝对...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我從上週的混亂中學到的東西","the_new_excerpt":"我在過去的4年裏一直在做美元成本平均法，我決定給它加點料。\n上週，我跳上了GME的火車。我想我有錢，我願意\n冒着使用<5%的投資組合的風險，我很幸運地在上週一94美元進入。\n\n我看到整個星期有3-4倍的收益，我絕對...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lgyeh1","excerpt":"Bumble IPO tomorrow.
