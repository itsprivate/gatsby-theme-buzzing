Nothing too crazy, but I am hoping that I can maximize profit on the squeeze. </p>\n\n<p>Wondering what opinions are about prospects on GME - what will it look like over the next couple of days/weeks? </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen people mentioning a potential high around $90 come Friday, with some slightly lower figures around $60. On the opposite end, I&#39;ve seen people saying it could jump over $100, maybe hitting the low $300s - I saw some more extreme notions that it could clip near $1,000 at a peak squeeze. </p>\n\n<p>Just curious about people&#39;s thoughts on the matter and the timeline for the peaks. I&#39;m siding with Reddit on the general direction, and am optimistic that it plays out in our collective favor - hoping to get some funds to put towards my wife&#39;s business. </p>\n\n<p>If it hits around $90 should I cash out, or is there a considerable likelihood that the $90-100 range is the lower end of what we could realistically expect? I&#39;ll be keeping a close eye on the ticker, but am curious about others&#39; tactics on how long they plan to hold. </p>\n\n<p>I welcome thoughts and opinions! Cheers~</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxnzny/realistic_gme_predictions_over_the_coming/","title":"Realistic $GME predictions over the coming days/weeks?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-15T15:58:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-15 15:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kxnzny","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxnzny/realistic_gme_predictions_over_the_coming/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxnzny/realistic_gme_predictions_over_the_coming/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"jbb3205","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jbb3205","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"jbb3205","score":65,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"现实的通用汽车E预测在未来几天/几周？","the_new_excerpt":"用一些长颈鹿的钱跳上了GME火箭，现在手里有20个左右的。\n股。没有什么太疯狂的，但我希望，我可以最大限度地提高利润的\n挤。\n\n\n接下来的几天/几周？\n\n我看到有人...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"現實的通用汽車E預測在未來幾天/幾周？","the_new_excerpt":"用一些長頸鹿的錢跳上了GME火箭，現在手裏有20個左右的。\n股。沒有什麼太瘋狂的，但我希望，我可以最大限度地提高利潤的\n擠。\n\n\n接下來的幾天/幾周？\n\n我看到有人...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l56er2","excerpt":"This crazy market we see today is nothing new.
