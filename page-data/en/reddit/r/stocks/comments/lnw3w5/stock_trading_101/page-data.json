I&#39;m going to outline some best practices for making money in the market year over year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1.  Never invest in something that you don&#39;t understand.</strong><br/>\nGME was the latest example but I&#39;ve seen people do the same thing with Calls, Puts, Shorts and other more exotic trading mechanics. If you don&#39;t understand something don&#39;t invest in it... assume that there&#39;s someone who does understand it and will trade on their deeper knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.  Trade in the long-term.</strong><br/>\nYour ideal positions will be in companies where you&#39;re betting on their 3-5 year trajectory.  The markets have a ton of daily/monthly volatility but if you&#39;re taking a longer-term view, you&#39;ll have many more wins than losses.  Long-term trading is also far more favorable in terms of taxes.  This can give you an instant 20-30% advantage over a swing/day-trader.   Translation...  You&#39;re not gaining or losing money every day... you only gain or lose when you sell. Your potential is going up or down but it&#39;s just potential.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.  Care about the companies you&#39;re investing in.</strong><br/>\nInvesting is both a way to make money but it&#39;s also a way to support companies that you believe in.  It&#39;s more fun to own a stock of a company that&#39;s doing something great than simply a company you think is trending on reddit. It also incentivizes you to read their financials, their news releases and makes you knowledgable for when to sell if you start seeing long-term trends that don&#39;t look good.  I love talking about the products of the stocks I own because I tend to like them both.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4.  Do your research.</strong><br/>\nIf you&#39;re going to own an individual stocks then do your research.  Ideally in a field or area that&#39;s tied to something you already know a lot about.  Some people know a lot about sports, others know a lot about travel, or science, or cars.  Lean into the sectors that you&#39;re interested in and do your research.  Each sector has winners and if you&#39;re deeper in one sector, you&#39;ll be more capable of spotting winners.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5.  Zoom in and Out of the Chart</strong><br/>\nStocks tend to follow macro-trends.  If you&#39;re buying or selling you need to understand the last few years to get a sense of what is likely to happen.  Companies tend to have inertia. If they lift 10% yearly, they have some inertia to keep doing that.  If they stay flat or go down... they have inertia to continue. Look for changes that can alter that trajectory. If you can spot these inflection points, there&#39;s a lot of potential to outperform.   Sometimes these inflection points are external (COVID/Election) sometimes they are internal (new CEO, new product, new direction), your research of the sector (4) can often give you an advantage when thinking long-term (1) over people who are zoomed in. Remember to think long-term.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6.  Don&#39;t invest money that you can&#39;t afford to lose it.</strong><br/>\nIf you invest stocks long enough you&#39;ll have bad days... really bad days but that&#39;s part of the market. If it stresses you out... Don&#39;t do it. That being said, a disciplined and long term investing approach can give you a lot of financial freedom... and it can be a lot of fun.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lnw3w5/stock_trading_101/","title":"Stock Trading 101","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-20T05:43:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-20 05:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lnw3w5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnw3w5/stock_trading_101/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnw3w5/stock_trading_101/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"graiz","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/graiz","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"graiz","score":1033,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lw2lii","excerpt":"Original article:\n\nhttps://www.nme.com/news/music/hundreds-k-pop-releases-removed-spotify-worldwide-2890528\n\n> Spotify launched in South Korea on February 1, 2021, but did so without music\n> from artists with licensing deals under Kakao M, including IU, Zico and more.\n> \n> Now, releases distributed…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lw2lii/spotify_removes_hundreds_of_kpop_songs_globally/","title":"Spotify removes hundreds of K-pop songs globally, unable to reach an agreement with Kakao M","date":"March 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Spotify全球删除数百首K-pop歌曲，无法与Kakao M达成协议。","the_new_excerpt":"原文。\n\nhttps://www.nme.com/news/music/hundreds-k-pop-releases-removed-spotify-worldwide-2890528\n\n> 2021年2月1日，Spotify在韩国推出，但做的时候没有音乐\n> 与Kakao M旗下的艺人达成授权协议，包括IU、Zico等。\n> \n>现在，发行的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Spotify全球刪除數百首K-pop歌曲，無法與Kakao M達成協議。","the_new_excerpt":"原文。\n\nhttps://www.nme.com/news/music/hundreds-k-pop-releases-removed-spotify-worldwide-2890528\n\n> 2021年2月1日，Spotify在韓國推出，但做的時候沒有音樂\n> 與Kakao M旗下的藝人達成授權協議，包括IU、Zico等。\n> \n>現在，發行的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lw4qgi","excerpt":"just for you.","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw4qgi/fuck_it_heres_your_daily_gme_threadmegathread_3221/","title":"Fuck it, Heres your daily GME Thread-Megathread 3/2/21","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 02, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"妈的，这是你每天的GME话题--超级话题3/2/21","the_new_excerpt":"只为你。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"媽的，這是你每天的GME話題--超級話題3/2/21","the_new_excerpt":"只爲你。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lnw3w5","previousId":"RedditPost-lw2lii","nextId":"RedditPost-lw4qgi","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lnw3w5/stock_trading_101/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
