My gut tells me that TSLA is not more valuable than all the world’s other car companies combined.  They have first-mover advantage in EVs but I feel like other car companies will close this gap quickly.  Established manufacturers have the infrastructure in place and after some initial costs and challenges converting to EV I think at least some will emerge as viable contenders.  This leads me to question tsla share price over the next decade, as they no longer are the only really impressive EV.  This is just a gut feeling I would love to hear better insight either way.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lwt43o/teslas_competitive_advantage_in_the_next_decade/","title":"Tesla’s competitive advantage in the next decade","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-03T19:06:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-03 19:06","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lwt43o","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lwt43o/teslas_competitive_advantage_in_the_next_decade/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lwt43o/teslas_competitive_advantage_in_the_next_decade/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Rang_Dipkin","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Rang_Dipkin","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Rang_Dipkin","score":76,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"特斯拉未来十年的竞争优势","the_new_excerpt":"我想从特斯拉的牛市和熊市中得到一些启示，他们在什么地方\n认为特斯拉会从这里开始。我的直觉告诉我，TSLA不比\n全球所有其他汽车公司的总和。他们有先发优势，在\n电动车，但我觉得其他车企会缩小这个差距... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉未來十年的競爭優勢","the_new_excerpt":"我想從特斯拉的牛市和熊市中得到一些啓示，他們在什麼地方\n認爲特斯拉會從這裏開始。我的直覺告訴我，TSLA不比\n全球所有其他汽車公司的總和。他們有先發優勢，在\n電動車，但我覺得其他車企會縮小這個差距... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m4uv8i","excerpt":"Good Sunday morning to all of you here on r/stocks [/r/stocks].
