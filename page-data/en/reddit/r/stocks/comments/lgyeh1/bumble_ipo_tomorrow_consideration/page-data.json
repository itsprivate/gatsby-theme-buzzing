Also carving out a unique niche in the world of social media with a woman-initiated contact focus and run by a team top to bottom which is almost exclusively woman. That&#39;s unusual. Is it good unusual? Is it bad unusual? I don&#39;t know -- but it&#39;s unusual, and unusual stuff should make you look.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-009745/\">https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-009745/</a></p>\n\n<p>From Q3 2020</p>\n\n<p>- 42M monthly active users<br/>\n- 2.4M paid users<br/>\n- 376m revenue on the year<br/>\n- ~$8.95/mau<br/>\n- ~$156/arppu</p>\n\n<p>Their primary rival is this<br/>\n<a href=\"https://ir.mtch.com/overview/default.aspx\">https://ir.mtch.com/overview/default.aspx</a><br/>\nWhich dominates the space with all the big brands you probably have heard of: Match, Tinder, OKCupid, PlentyOfFish, etc.<br/>\nI think it&#39;s fair to say Match IS the space.<br/>\n- Has ~639m revenue by the same time period 2020<br/>\n- Has &lt;???&gt; monthly active users (trying to find this; paid users is understandably the focus of most non stale data, it&#39;s either that displayed or TOTAL users which is not a useful metric);<br/>\n- Has ~11m paid users<br/>\n- ~58/arppu</p>\n\n<p>Match has a market cap of 44.15B as of this morning.<br/>\nBumble IPO values at ~8B. That feels aggressive, but there&#39;s 44.15B lunch money on the table to steal plus the market itself is just straight up growing. Match has a larger market share with more users and more revenue but at worse value-at-a-casual-glance </p>\n\n<p>Bumble is run by Whitney Wolfe Herd. ...Amazing name, right? She also worked in Tinder leadership until ~2014. She named it, even! She left because of sexual harassment, and to follow her passion to build the social media empire she wanted to live in. She&#39;s got a chip on her shoulder and knows the competition from the inside intricately. I love that dynamic a lot.<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-bumble-ceo-whitney-wolfe-herd-net-worth-family-ipo-2020-9#:%7E:text=Meet%20Whitney%20Wolfe%20Herd%2C%20the,publicly%20filed%20for%20an%20IPO\">https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-bumble-ceo-whitney-wolfe-herd-net-worth-family-ipo-2020-9#:~:text=Meet%20Whitney%20Wolfe%20Herd%2C%20the,publicly%20filed%20for%20an%20IPO</a></p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a broader look at the team<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.comparably.com/companies/bumble/executive-team\">https://www.comparably.com/companies/bumble/executive-team</a></p>\n\n<p>You should also know... Bumble is not set to just carve out their niche of DATING and squat on that. They want to go deeper into lifestyle and professional networking oriented around woman initiated contacts. I see encroaching on LinkedIn (probably unsuccessfully) but maybe getting a foot hold unexpectedly in something like venture capital relations which could desperately use that kind of disruption. Is that last part on their radar? I don&#39;t know, I just made it up, but it 100% would be in my crosshairs if I were these people. The niche value here of woman first media is a big deal wherever you put it. That space is SPARSE and the want is real.</p>\n\n<p>Spitball casual target... let&#39;s say 40B market cap in a 3 year horizon. Standing a hair under present day Match value in 3 years. +400% gains on that very very rough theory.  </p>\n\n<p>What are yall thoughts on the fundamentals here and the potential impact to the space?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lgyeh1/bumble_ipo_tomorrow_consideration/","title":"Bumble IPO Tomorrow; Consideration","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T21:28:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 21:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lgyeh1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lgyeh1/bumble_ipo_tomorrow_consideration/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lgyeh1/bumble_ipo_tomorrow_consideration/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Michaeldgagnon","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Michaeldgagnon","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Michaeldgagnon","score":78,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"大黄蜂明天IPO；考虑","the_new_excerpt":"明天Bumble IPO。与Match正面竞争，抢占空间。另外\n在社交媒体世界中开辟了一个独特的利基，由妇女发起的。\n联系重点，并由一个从上到下几乎全是女性的团队管理。\n这是不寻常的。这是好的不寻常吗？是坏的不寻常？我不知道...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"大黃蜂明天IPO；考慮","the_new_excerpt":"明天Bumble IPO。與Match正面競爭，搶佔空間。另外\n在社交媒體世界中開闢了一個獨特的利基，由婦女發起的。\n聯繫重點，並由一個從上到下幾乎全是女性的團隊管理。\n這是不尋常的。這是好的不尋常嗎？是壞的不尋常？我不知道...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lonztb","excerpt":"I was one of the first investors to speak to a law firm (ChapmanAlbin LLC) re:\nRH and the shenanigans that they pulled.\n\nWell, ABC reached out to the Law Firm and asked if they had anyone who would be\na good candidate to be interviewed regarding my experience and they recommended\nme.\n\nI spoke to the…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lonztb/on_monday_ill_be_doing_a_5_hour_interview_with/","title":"On Monday, I’ll be doing a 5 hour interview with ABC for a Hulu special on the GME saga.
