Y&#39;all seemed to enjoy it so I figured an update almost end-of-year post would be in order. </p>\n\n<p>Original post: <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gkj3ei/i_had_my_first_ever_day_trading_put_10_in_10/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gkj3ei/i_had_my_first_ever_day_trading_put_10_in_10/</a></p>\n\n<p>This was my portfolio on that day (plus the gains that day):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Aurora Cannabis (+68.67%)</li>\n<li>Cronos Group (+11.94%)</li>\n<li>Peloton (+7.33%)</li>\n<li>Zoom (+4.12%)</li>\n<li>Lululemon (+4%)</li>\n<li>Microsoft (+1.45%)</li>\n<li>Amazon (+0.87%)</li>\n<li>QQQ (+0.64%)</li>\n<li>SPDR S&amp;P 500 (+0.45%)</li>\n<li>Apple (-0.59) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since then I upped my investment to almost $2k with a total gain of $814.51 so far.</p>\n\n<p>My approach was to sell off some of the volatile cannabis and pandemic stocks, stay away from super involved day-by-day trading, and focus on companies I believe will be good in 5-10 years from now.</p>\n\n<p>My current portfolio (plus total investment and gains so far):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tesla ($275 / $462.99)</li>\n<li>Apple ($415 / $130.11)</li>\n<li>QQQ ($687 / $129.22)</li>\n<li>Square ($116 / $44.49)</li>\n<li>Alphabet ($175 / $24.20)</li>\n<li>Microsoft ($200 / $20.62)</li>\n<li>Shopify ($50 / $2.88)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some notes and mistakes I made:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Mistake: I bought Shopify much earlier before their big pop because I believe in their business model and leadership, then panic sold when it dropped a bit and since then it went WAY up and I missed out on that.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mistake: Same thing happened with Spotify but I haven&#39;t bought back in out of spite.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mistake: Not putting in more money in general because 2020 has been a terrible year for me financially due to canceled jobs thanks to Covid. It&#39;s taking every fiber of strength to not pull out this money too.</p></li>\n<li><p>Good thing: staying away from following all the news and pretending I am a genius predictor about which real life news will make a price go up or down.</p></li>\n<li><p>Good thing: I still very much enjoy it and would love to continue going this way. I realize for many my strategy is probably a boring conservative one but I am most comfortable with this and I feel it still did quite well for me, mostly thanks to Tesla of course (and who knows where that price will go) but the rest of them went up too still.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>edit: formatting/typo</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kkg7fi/follow_up_post_from_the_guy_who_was_drunk_with/","title":"Follow up post from the guy who was drunk with power after his first trading day","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"December 26, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-26T16:56:16.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-26 16:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kkg7fi","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kkg7fi/follow_up_post_from_the_guy_who_was_drunk_with/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kkg7fi/follow_up_post_from_the_guy_who_was_drunk_with/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"longsh0t1994","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/longsh0t1994","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"longsh0t1994","score":140,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"第一个交易日后，那个喝醉了权力的家伙发了后续帖子","the_new_excerpt":"七个月前，我发帖子说，我带着高达100美元的身家进入竞技场。\n对10股票(每股10美元)的投资，以及之后我是如何沉迷于权力的\n这是第一天。你们看起来都很喜欢，所以我想最新消息差不多\n年终职位将是合适的。\n\n原始…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"第一個交易日後，那個喝醉了權力的傢伙發了後續帖子","the_new_excerpt":"七個月前，我發帖子說，我帶着高達100美元的身家進入競技場。\n對10股票(每股10美元)的投資，以及之後我是如何沉迷於權力的\n這是第一天。你們看起來都很喜歡，所以我想最新消息差不多\n年終職位將是合適的。\n\n原始…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kkhgg7","excerpt":"I was interested in robotic/automated farming ever since I saw the farm.bot\n[https://farm.bot] back in 2017, many other companies like Iron Ox and Sustenir\nare also very similar in which their goal is to reduce waste (soil, land, water)\nand automate farming.\n\n\n\nBut since I only got into investing…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kkhgg7/where_are_all_the_robotic_agriculture_stocks/","title":"Where are all the robotic agriculture stocks?","date":"December 26, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"所有的机器人农业库存都在哪里？","the_new_excerpt":"自从我看到农场后，我就对机器人/自动化农业很感兴趣。\n[https://farm.bot]回到2017年，许多其他公司，如铁牛和苏斯汀\n他们的目标也非常相似，都是减少浪费(土壤、土地、水)\n并实现农业自动化。\n\n\n\n但因为我只投资了…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"所有的機器人農業庫存都在哪裏？","the_new_excerpt":"自從我看到農場後，我就對機器人/自動化農業很感興趣。\n[https://farm.bot]回到2017年，許多其他公司，如鐵牛和蘇斯汀\n他們的目標也非常相似，都是減少浪費(土壤、土地、水)\n並實現農業自動化。\n\n\n\n但因爲我只投資了…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1342868785062150147","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1342868785062150147","title":"Bitcoin $25,000.\n\n$BTC https://t.co/0AJt7pBdOd","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"December 26, 2020","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"比特币2.5万美元。\n\nhttps://t.co/0AJt7pBdOd TC巴恩斯","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"比特幣2.5萬美元。\n\nhttps://t.co/0AJt7pBdOd TC巴恩斯","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kkg7fi","previousId":"RedditPost-kkhgg7","nextId":"TweetPost-1342868785062150147","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kkg7fi/follow_up_post_from_the_guy_who_was_drunk_with/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
