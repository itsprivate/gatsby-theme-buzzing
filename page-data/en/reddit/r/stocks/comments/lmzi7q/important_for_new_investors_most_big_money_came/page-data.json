There are peaks and valleys. When you ask &quot;how does everyone get good deals?&quot; it&#39;s because they bought in 6 months ago and have held on since. There were times when there was a lot of green and sometimes when there was red (even more red than today). Unless you&#39;re pretty lucky, you will likely not buy something today and make a huge profit next week. Many/most of these plays are decisions people made awhile ago slowly coming to fruition (in a record bull-market no less).</p>\n\n<p>So, in the moment, all the red seems bad. But today doesn&#39;t matter unless you&#39;re buying or selling. What matters is months/years ahead. We&#39;re making decisions that will play out in May or August or 2023.
