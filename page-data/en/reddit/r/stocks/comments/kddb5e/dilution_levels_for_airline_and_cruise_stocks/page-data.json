What this means is they needed money and issued more shares to raise money. <em>edit: this is not necessarily bad when the money is put to good use, but much of the money raised for the companies in this post was to simply pay expenses without any revenue coming in</em></p>\n\n<p>It may be a surprise then for new investors when they don&#39;t see their beaten down stocks return to the pre-covid price during and after the recovery. </p>\n\n<p>To help, here are popular recovery stocks, how many more shares have been issued, and the adjusted pre-covid price for these stocks.</p>\n\n<p>Prices are in USD and I used the <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/CCL/shares_outstanding\">YCharts site</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Carnival Cruise (CCL)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1 price: 51.31</p>\n\n<p>Dilution: 60% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>31.25</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 58.83</p>\n\n<p>Dilution: 47% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>40.02</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Royal Caribbean (RCL)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 134.65</p>\n\n<p>Share dilution: 7% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>125.84</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>American Airlines (AAL)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 29.09</p>\n\n<p>Share dilution: 44% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>20.2</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Spirit Airlines (SAVE)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 40.65 </p>\n\n<p>Share dilution: 42.6% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>28.5</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Jet Blue (JBLU)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 18.89 </p>\n\n<p>Share dilution: 15% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>16.43</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Delta (DAL)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 59.04</p>\n\n<p>Share dilution: They actually have less shares outstanding? I don&#39;t know a lot about the deals airline companies took or the debt they took either.</p>\n\n<p>Return price: 60?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Southwest (LUV)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 54.84</p>\n\n<p>Share dilution: 16% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>47.27</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>United (UAL)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 89.74</p>\n\n<p>Share dilution: 18% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>76.05</strong></p>\n\n<p>A note is that some of the airline stocks actually rose until mid-February. I wanted consistency between the stock price dates so I just did YTD. Also this does not account for new debt or sold planes/ships.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kddb5e/dilution_levels_for_airline_and_cruise_stocks/","title":"Dilution Levels for Airline and Cruise Stocks Guide","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"December 16, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-16T00:58:49.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-16 00:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kddb5e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kddb5e/dilution_levels_for_airline_and_cruise_stocks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kddb5e/dilution_levels_for_airline_and_cruise_stocks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"prcpnearespikey","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/prcpnearespikey","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"prcpnearespikey","score":331,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"航空公司和邮轮股票稀释水平指南","the_new_excerpt":"许多持有复苏股票的人不知道他们有多少公司\n投资于稀释了他们的股份。这意味着他们需要钱\n发行更多的股票来筹集资金。编辑：这不一定是坏事，当\n资金得到了很好的利用，但为…筹集的大部分资金","locale":"zh"},{"title":"航空公司和郵輪股票稀釋水平指南","the_new_excerpt":"許多持有復甦股票的人不知道他們有多少公司\n投資於稀釋了他們的股份。這意味着他們需要錢\n發行更多的股票來籌集資金。編輯：這不一定是壞事，當\n資金得到了很好的利用，但爲…籌集的大部分資金","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25605470","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25605470","title":"Artichoke is a Ruby made with Rust that compiles to WebAssembly","date":"January 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"洋蓟是一种用铁锈制成的红宝石，可以编译成WebAssembly","locale":"zh"},{"title":"洋薊是一種用鐵鏽製成的紅寶石，可以編譯成WebAssembly","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-koh6km","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/koh6km/i_love_my_dad_this_is_where_he_put_his_xmas_gift/","title":"I love my Dad.
