This individual was wrote to by a company telling him that he could make serious money by doing what he does already, all he has to do is mention a few specific penny stocks to his audience throughout his videos. This is unnerving and the company representative admitted to this YouTuber that he was already working with (and paying) dozens of popular investing channels. This is clearly a pump and dump scheme by this company in a effort to raise the penny stock’s price, only for it to crash down later. Everyone wins except the audience tuning into these videos to learn and get some investment tips. I’m sure there are genuine YouTubers out there who really want to educate and help people with investing but it’s better to be cautious and always do your own research first. Ultimately, what you do with your money has to be decided by you alone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l5uj72/be_careful_on_youtube/","title":"Be careful on YouTube.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-27T07:10:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-27 07:10","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l5uj72","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l5uj72/be_careful_on_youtube/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l5uj72/be_careful_on_youtube/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ser_antonii","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ser_antonii","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ser_antonii","score":369,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"在YouTube上要小心。","the_new_excerpt":"我最近看了一个视频，是关于一个YouTuber的视频，他揭示了一个可怕的但是\n真正的问题，发生在YouTube上。这个人是由一个\n公司告诉他，他可以通过做他所做的事情赚大钱。\n已经，他所要做的就是提到一些特定的仙股，以他的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在YouTube上要小心。","the_new_excerpt":"我最近看了一個視頻，是關於一個YouTuber的視頻，他揭示了一個可怕的但是\n真正的問題，發生在YouTube上。這個人是由一個\n公司告訴他，他可以通過做他所做的事情賺大錢。\n已經，他所要做的就是提到一些特定的仙股，以他的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lbyf09","excerpt":"Enjoy.","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbyf09/gme_overnight_thread_sec_intern_meetandgreet/","title":"GME overnight thread / SEC intern meet-and-greet","date":"February 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME通宵线/证监会实习生见面会。","the_new_excerpt":"好好享受吧","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME通宵線/證監會實習生見面會。","the_new_excerpt":"好好享受吧","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lbsu4y","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbsu4y/allin_with_50k_of_my_retirement_as_of_this/","title":"All-in with 50k of my retirement as of this morning.
