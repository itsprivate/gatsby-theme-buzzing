I just wanted folks to be aware of something important, CAPITAL GAINS TAXES. If you’re super lucky and get that $1 million trade, awesome, you deserve it. But Uncle Sam (or whatever he’s called in your home country) will take his cut, and you have to keep that money separate from your other investing, or you’ll be sorry later.</p>\n\n<p>In the U.S. LONG-TERM capital gains taxes are super low, to encourage and reward investment. Long-term investing rates are 0% if your income is under $40k, 15% if it’s between $40k and $441,450, and 20% if $441k or more. Piece of cake.</p>\n\n<p>But this is trading, so you’ll be paying SHORT-TERM capital gains, which in the U.S. is counted just like income. The income brackets are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%. This means if you’re a young dude trading in between your Uber jobs, you will pay a reasonable amount of taxes on your realized gains. But if you’re a high earner, paying 37% Federal and up to 13.3% if you live in California, you need SAVE half of those gains, because they’re entered when the gain is realized. The WORST thing you can do is realize $1 million (or whatever) in actual gains, then go on to piss away those profits in other stupid moves afterwards, because the government will still want their cut.</p>\n\n<p>Happily, <del>your income tax bracket is determined by your actual income (1099’ed wages, income from rents), and not by the actual gains themselves</del>. (Seems this is not correct, see comments for discussion.) </p>\n\n<p>(While I’m here I’ll ask anyone not up on this stuff to learn how marginal or maximum tax rates work. You basically pay $0 on anything between $0 and $9875, 10% on $9875 to $40,125, 22% from $40,125 thru $85,525, and so on, meaning your actual tax rate is a blend of all of these tax rates. I meet so many people who think that earning $1 more makes their entire annual income suddenly taxed at a higher rate, I swear...)</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR, if you make any short-term money from all of this, talk to a smart professional who will tell you how much tax you will owe. Put that money in a separate bank account because you’ve already spent it. Oh, and “forget” to tell any family and friends about your windfall.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck to all of you!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lavlnb/psa_dont_forget_about_capital_gains_taxes/","title":"PSA: Don't forget about Capital Gains taxes!","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T19:47:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 19:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lavlnb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lavlnb/psa_dont_forget_about_capital_gains_taxes/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lavlnb/psa_dont_forget_about_capital_gains_taxes/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"peterinjapan","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/peterinjapan","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"peterinjapan","score":149,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"PSA：别忘了资本利得税!","the_new_excerpt":"希望大家都能远离科罗娜，并在你做的时候玩得开心。\n交易。我只是想让大家注意一些重要的事情，资本收益。\n税。如果你超级幸运，得到那100万美元的交易，真棒，你应得的。\n它。但是山姆大叔（或者不管他在你们家叫什么... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"PSA：別忘了資本利得稅!","the_new_excerpt":"希望大家都能遠離科羅娜，並在你做的時候玩得開心。\n交易。我只是想讓大家注意一些重要的事情，資本收益。\n稅。如果你超級幸運，得到那100萬美元的交易，真棒，你應得的。\n它。但是山姆大叔（或者不管他在你們家叫什麼... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26093535","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26093535","title":"Kenyan recycles plastic waste into bricks stronger than concrete","date":"February 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"肯尼亚回收塑料垃圾制成比混凝土还坚固的砖块","locale":"zh"},{"title":"肯尼亞回收塑料垃圾製成比混凝土還堅固的磚塊","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lgxx3h","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgxx3h/yolo_am_i_doing_this_right/","title":"Yolo!
