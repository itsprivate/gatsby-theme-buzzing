I&#39;m not a financial advisor. These are just my opinions and do not represent the views of this community.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier today I <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/explodinghedgefunds/comments/l8jed7/gme_autistic_epiphany/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\">tried to debunk</a> the fUnDaMeNtAlS argument against holding shares at these new prices.</p>\n\n<p>Then I read this awesome post about how <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l928lr/obfuscation_misinformation_propaganda_and_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\">we&#39;re being manipulated</a> from all sides.</p>\n\n<p>This made me want to come up with the simplest win strategy for every retail investor, acting on their own, no matter what bullshit comes our way over the next week or more. Yes, we&#39;ve already figured out that this means to hold $GME. However, not everyone will not understand the method to our madness and chalk it up to the fact that we&#39;re just a bunch of degenerate gamblers. We need them to know why this time.</p>\n\n<p>Enter the $GME <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma\">prisoner&#39;s dilemma game</a>. Here&#39;s the setup. The hedgies and banks can secretly coordinate a crash without being punished. If we cooperate on a short squeeze, it is publicly visible and can result in consequences for us. Still, last week proved the fact that humans, acting individually, have a bias to cooperate on a collective good (see wiki link at start of this paragraph for source). This is our ace in the hole.</p>\n\n<p>The only way they can win is when we betray each other (we won&#39;t) like prisoners being pressured by cops to rat on each other in separate interrogation rooms. The cops (hedgies and banks) will try everything to manipulate, scare, sow distrust, and incentivize the prisoners (retail investors) to rat on each other. The only way the prisoners get the best outcome is if they HOLD $GME 🚀.</p>\n\n<p>The Nash equilibrium for this game is for the prisoners to rat on each other. That&#39;s the mathematical equilibrium/outcome. However, I&#39;m arguing that we&#39;ve demonstrated our ability to surpass that. We&#39;re using our human bias to act individually (not cooperatively) for the collective good to overcome this math. We&#39;re maximizing the collective gain, not the individual gain. This is the whole point of a short squeeze that sticks it to the hedgies.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: HOLD</p>\n\n<p>Edit: A throw away account commented that this is sometimes called <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality\">superrationality</a> and then deleted their comment...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l9chts/prisoners_dilemma_hold_gme/","title":"Prisoner's Dilemma - Hold $GME","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-31T17:30:38.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-31 17:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l9chts","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l9chts/prisoners_dilemma_hold_gme/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l9chts/prisoners_dilemma_hold_gme/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"moazzam0","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/moazzam0","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"moazzam0","score":162,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"囚徒的困境--持有GME美元","the_new_excerpt":"这不是财务建议。我不是一个财务顾问。这些只是我的\n观点，不代表本社区的观点。\n\n今天早些时候，我试图揭穿\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/explodinghedgefunds/comments/l8jed7/gme_autistic_epiphany/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share]\n的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"囚徒的困境--持有GME美元","the_new_excerpt":"這不是財務建議。我不是一個財務顧問。這些只是我的\n觀點，不代表本社區的觀點。\n\n今天早些時候，我試圖揭穿\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/explodinghedgefunds/comments/l8jed7/gme_autistic_epiphany/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share]\n的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26068032","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26068032","title":"Blog with Markdown and Git, and degrade gracefully through time","date":"February 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"用Markdown和Git写博客，并通过时间优雅地降解。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"用Markdown和Git寫博客，並通過時間優雅地降解。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26066340","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26066340","title":"Show HN: \"Programming Algorithms in Lisp” Book","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 08, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"出示HN：《Lisp编程算法》一书","locale":"zh"},{"title":"出示HN：《Lisp編程算法》一書","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l9chts","previousId":"HnPost-26068032","nextId":"HnPost-26066340","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l9chts/prisoners_dilemma_hold_gme/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
