Didn&#39;t have a big position to begin with, but still. You can see the <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/8Nd0PUH\">screenshot of that transaction here</a>.  (It is in Finnish, but it says I sold 1150 shares at 3,18 on 8th of January).</p>\n\n<p>Now today, after some careful consideration, I decided to hop back in, with a bigger, 9k position. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/pxZiEhW\">Screen here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll tell you why. </p>\n\n<p>First of all, every Finn has an opinion about Nokia, and they&#39;re very sentimental and nostalgic about it.  The company made a lot of people rich and they hope it&#39;ll become one of the great ones someday. And they&#39;re willing to hang on through the toughest of times. I do not know how much of the hype on interest is made up and how much is real, but I&#39;m sure many Finns will view the latest surge in the stock price as a positive and - I believe - will jump back in and go long. The company has been all over the local news yesterday and today, so the media is adding to the hype. </p>\n\n<p>Second, I think the company has been undervalued for quite some time now. And I don&#39;t blame the investors. There was every reason to think that the company was done for. But now it genuinely looks like there is a meaningful change coming. It might take a few years, but the company has definitely renewed their strategy and is moving in the right direction. </p>\n\n<p>Third, the analysts seem to agree. In the past week at least 4 different analysts have upgraded their target price. Latest were banks Danske Bank to 4,30€ and Handelsbanken to 4,40€.</p>\n\n<p>To sum it up, the hype might not last, but I genuinely feel the potential is there.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l5bocw/an_honest_case_on_nok/","title":"An honest case on NOK","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T19:42:44.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 19:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l5bocw","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l5bocw/an_honest_case_on_nok/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l5bocw/an_honest_case_on_nok/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Iskari","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Iskari","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Iskari","score":64,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"关于NOK的诚实案例","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n我一直看到这些帖子，关于黑幕账户试图炒作诺基亚等。\n不知道什么，但我觉得我应该船到这个对话。\n\n首先，几周前，我做了一个错误的决定（事后看20/20），我的决定是，我的手机是我的。\n决定卖掉我的NOK股票。没有一个大的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於NOK的誠實案例","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n我一直看到這些帖子，關於黑幕賬戶試圖炒作諾基亞等。\n不知道什麼，但我覺得我應該船到這個對話。\n\n首先，幾周前，我做了一個錯誤的決定（事後看20/20），我的決定是，我的手機是我的。\n決定賣掉我的NOK股票。沒有一個大的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26014616","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26014616","title":"Myths of Vaccine Manufacturing","date":"February 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"疫苗生产的误区","locale":"zh"},{"title":"疫苗生產的誤區","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lc1udz","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc1udz/udeepfuckingvalue_is_being_asked_to_testify_in/","title":"u/DeepFuckingValue is being asked to testify in the upcoming GameStop hearing. \"Diamond hands and tendies gonna enter the Congressional Record\"","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 04, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"U/DeepFuckingValue被要求在即将到来的GameStop听证会上作证。\"钻石之手和男妓将进入国会记录\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"U/DeepFuckingValue被要求在即將到來的GameStop聽證會上作證。\"鑽石之手和男妓將進入國會記錄\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l5bocw","previousId":"HnPost-26014616","nextId":"RedditPost-lc1udz","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l5bocw/an_honest_case_on_nok/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
