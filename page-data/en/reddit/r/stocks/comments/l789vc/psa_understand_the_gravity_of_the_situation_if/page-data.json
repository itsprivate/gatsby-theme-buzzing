It is great that everyone is fighting the good fight and telling hedge funds to shove it, and I believe that this event will be impactful in the years to come.</p>\n\n<p>That said, when you do buy, do it for the cause. Because you like the stock. <strong>Because you want to expose how shit the system is</strong>. Not cause you expect that you will make anything from this trade and that you will be able to pay of your tuition fees and home loans, or because you think that you are giving the middle finger to big money, because you are not. </p>\n\n<p>This is simply due to the sheer information and technology asymmetry.</p>\n\n<p>Reddit&#39;s plan is in plain sight for all of the institutions to see. Long thesis tied to gamma and short squeeze on Friday, buy and hold and remove limits to avoid giving brokers information, &quot;get out before the bubble bursts&quot;. Most new players are on platforms that they themselves understand less than institutional investors. It is hubris to assume that institutions with all their experience with manipulation and their PhDs that literally spend their entire lives studying specific topics, yes, even short interest and how it impacts the markets, will not have a counter strategy for the very obvious retail play. </p>\n\n<p>And the worst thing is that you do not know what it is; the price could be $1000 and back to $200 within minutes tomorrow if they so choose to ride the retail pump and dump, there could be no gamma squeeze at all as perhaps all of their shorts have already moved out in the dip to 100 today. What I am saying is that whatever happens tomorrow or the week after, the probability is very high that the institutions will still eat first, and the lucky initial buyers second, and the rest is likely going to be a dice roll.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I am going to make the sweeping assumption that most retail players have a surface level understanding on the strategies institutions are taking on this event. There has been a lot of focus on Melvin (almost a scapegoat at this point) and Citadel, but what about other players like Blackrock that are as strong and have unknown plans for the stock? Most will not understand the power dynamics between the organizations. One obvious example was Citadel snapping up Melvin in all of the chaos. Many other similar transactions are going on behind the scenes. Finally, they may underestimate the technology that they have at their disposal. People are paid millions to make their trades milliseconds faster, their codes a few percentage points more efficient - again, not resources your average investor has access to.</p>\n\n<p>The bright spot is the media coverage has been very negative towards malpractices in the finance industry and there will surely be some sort of legal reform. If you are getting in this late in the game and are willing to ride or die, do it because you are bringing down RH and co., and because you are exposing more scummy practices to the world to see. Chances are you will lose the fight, but you will win the war.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l789vc/psa_understand_the_gravity_of_the_situation_if/","title":"PSA: Understand the gravity of the situation if you are going to buy the meme stocks and definitely do not play with what you can't afford to lose","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-29T01:05:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-29 01:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l789vc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l789vc/psa_understand_the_gravity_of_the_situation_if/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l789vc/psa_understand_the_gravity_of_the_situation_if/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"calamitymagnet","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/calamitymagnet","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"calamitymagnet","score":980,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"PSA：如果你要买追忆股的话，要明白事态的严重性，绝对不要玩你输不起的东西。","the_new_excerpt":"根据/u/juaggo_之前发布的内容。很高兴大家都能\n打好仗，并告诉对冲基金推它，我相信，。\n这个活动将在未来几年产生影响。\n\n话说回来，当你买的时候，要为事业而买。因为你喜欢这只股票\n因为你...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"PSA：如果你要買追憶股的話，要明白事態的嚴重性，絕對不要玩你輸不起的東西。","the_new_excerpt":"根據/u/juaggo_之前發佈的內容。很高興大家都能\n打好仗，並告訴對沖基金推它，我相信，。\n這個活動將在未來幾年產生影響。\n\n話說回來，當你買的時候，要爲事業而買。因爲你喜歡這隻股票\n因爲你...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1357726976333787140","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1357726976333787140","title":"Job postings are like:\n\n\"Please upload your CV as a file\"\n\n\"Okay, now please type out into boxes all the things you just sent us in your CV\" https://t.co/jofOiBHG7u","date":"February 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"招聘信息是这样的\n\n\"请将你的简历以文件形式上传\"\n\n\"好的，现在请把你刚才发给我们的简历中的所有内容都打出框来 \"https://t.co/jofOiBHG7u。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"招聘信息是這樣的\n\n\"請將你的簡歷以文件形式上傳\"\n\n\"好的，現在請把你剛纔發給我們的簡歷中的所有內容都打出框來 \"https://t.co/jofOiBHG7u。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26043815","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26043815","title":"In historic shift, Virginia lawmakers pass marijuana legalization bills","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 06, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"历史性转变，弗吉尼亚州立法者通过大麻合法化法案","locale":"zh"},{"title":"歷史性轉變，弗吉尼亞州立法者通過大麻合法化法案","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l789vc","previousId":"TweetPost-1357726976333787140","nextId":"HnPost-26043815","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l789vc/psa_understand_the_gravity_of_the_situation_if/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
