I read alot in there about the stock market and various other things to educate myself but mainly how to make money legally. I got out 2019 with a newfound confidence and began working and investing every penny I had building my credit to &quot;excellent&quot;  and was doing GREAT. </p>\n\n<p>Fast forward 2021, I&#39;m married with 3 dependents and ive had to pull all my investing money for emergencies  and had quit investing for a while throughout 2020. Ive been trying to invest again but have had the absolute worst luck in doing so recently...</p>\n\n<p>I work 2 jobs + day labor when I can and it&#39;s barely enough to scrape by. Once the rent/bills are paid I have around $200 left for gas,food, etc. This leaves nothing to invest so I took advantage of these last stimulus and have lost about 30% of it since investing again.  </p>\n\n<p>I had a dream I could turn this 2k into 10k to invest in the SPY and safe growth etfs/stocks and I&#39;m just watching the little money I have dwindle away. I&#39;m just tired of being broke and not being able to provide for my family like I want to. I wanna buy my mom a house 1 day, I wanna own a house for the family I started and the stock market seemed like the only way for a collosal fuck up with no education to have a decent life. </p>\n\n<p>So what should I do? Pull the little money I have left and buy a handful of etfs to check back on in 10 years? Or should i Shut my little bitch ass up and work 4 jobs for the next 30 years?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m6cp7u/can_someone_give_me_some_advice/","title":"Can someone give me some advice","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-16T22:59:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-16 22:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m6cp7u","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6cp7u/can_someone_give_me_some_advice/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6cp7u/can_someone_give_me_some_advice/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"J_seven7","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/J_seven7","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"J_seven7","score":72,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"谁能给我一些建议","the_new_excerpt":"我从小就很穷，早年也很操蛋，进进出出的。\n在我2016-2019年入狱之前。我在里面读了很多关于股票\n市场和其他各种事情来教育自己，但主要是如何赚钱。\n合法的。我带着新的信心走出了2019年，开始工作...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"誰能給我一些建議","the_new_excerpt":"我從小就很窮，早年也很操蛋，進進出出的。\n在我2016-2019年入獄之前。我在裏面讀了很多關於股票\n市場和其他各種事情來教育自己，但主要是如何賺錢。\n合法的。我帶着新的信心走出了2019年，開始工作...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26480922","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26480922","title":"Swift Evolution: Actors","date":"March 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"迅速进化。演员","locale":"zh"},{"title":"迅速進化。演員","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m6hpof","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6hpof/bill_gross_is_short_gme_selling_250_and_300_calls/","title":"Bill Gross is short GME.
