You think you&#39;re staying on top of things by reading the posts end-to-end and finding opportunities that really make sense. You get really excited about opportunities with awesome DD but for one glaring issue....timing.</p>\n\n<p>The unfortunate reality is that this DD you found is only likely to get up-voted and become visible to you, after the stock has ALREADY popped. When the stock pops people get excited and they share it out...but it&#39;s always coming AFTER the pop. </p>\n\n<p>So, if your objective is to make a quick profit, you&#39;re setting yourself up for failure. Sure, you might get lucky, and you might still make a profit long-term, but your timing in the short-term will always be sub-optimal.</p>\n\n<p>Now...I&#39;m not knocking good DD as a way to find opportunities, but you should update your thinking and maybe taking the following steps instead of buying willy-nilly:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>After you see some sexy DD, check if the stock is already spiking</li>\n<li>If the stock is already spiking...then WATCH it...don&#39;t BUY it</li>\n<li>Wait for a short-term dip and buy then if you are still bullish </li>\n<li>Plan to hold for medium - long term...don&#39;t hope for a big short-term gain</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lh0na9/buying_on_stock_hype_is_not_the_way/","title":"Buying on stock hype is not the way","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T20:29:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 20:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lh0na9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lh0na9/buying_on_stock_hype_is_not_the_way/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lh0na9/buying_on_stock_hype_is_not_the_way/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"sewer_child123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/sewer_child123","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"sewer_child123","score":559,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"炒股买入不是办法","the_new_excerpt":"我是一个极度新手的交易员，但有些事情我一直在思考，就是\n别人可能会觉得有价值。\n\n比方说，你是像我这样的人，希望通过翻阅希望发现\n惊人的DD，这将是下一个伟大的事情，并火箭你的权利\n月亮... 你以为你是住在上面的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"炒股買入不是辦法","the_new_excerpt":"我是一個極度新手的交易員，但有些事情我一直在思考，就是\n別人可能會覺得有價值。\n\n比方說，你是像我這樣的人，希望通過翻閱希望發現\n驚人的DD，這將是下一個偉大的事情，併火箭你的權利\n月亮... 你以爲你是住在上面的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1363352852815560707","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1363352852815560707","title":"Tesla bitcoin gambit already made $1 billion, more than 2020 profit from car sales, estimates analyst https://t.co/rcAU0Vp6ex","date":"February 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"特斯拉比特币赌博已经赚了10亿美元，超过2020年汽车销售的利润，估计分析师https://t.co/rcAU0Vp6ex。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"特斯拉比特幣賭博已經賺了10億美元，超過2020年汽車銷售的利潤，估計分析師https://t.co/rcAU0Vp6ex。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lofeq1","excerpt":"I recently watched a YouTube video [https://youtu.be/IblkLFkayhw] online that\nfeatured the president of the Jordan Belford Company, Arvid Ali discussing\nCathie Wood and her investing strategies for the ARK ETF’s over the last several\nyears.\n\nThe basic gist was that Cathie is making the same trades…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lofeq1/ark_etf_advantages_disadvantages/","title":"ARK ETF - Advantages & Disadvantages","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 21, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ARK ETF - 优势与劣势","the_new_excerpt":"最近我在网上看了一段YouTube视频[https://youtu.be/IblkLFkayhw]，内容为\n乔丹贝尔福公司总裁阿维德-阿里讨论了以下内容\nCathie Wood和她在过去几年中对ARK ETF的投资策略。\n年。\n\n基本的要点是Cathie在做同样的交易... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ARK ETF - 優勢與劣勢","the_new_excerpt":"最近我在網上看了一段YouTube視頻[https://youtu.be/IblkLFkayhw]，內容爲\n喬丹貝爾福公司總裁阿維德-阿里討論了以下內容\nCathie Wood和她在過去幾年中對ARK ETF的投資策略。\n年。\n\n基本的要點是Cathie在做同樣的交易... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lh0na9","previousId":"TweetPost-1363352852815560707","nextId":"RedditPost-lofeq1","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lh0na9/buying_on_stock_hype_is_not_the_way/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
