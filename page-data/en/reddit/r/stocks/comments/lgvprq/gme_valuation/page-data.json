This is before they became a worldwide symbol of sticking it to the man.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming Cohen can only accomplish at GME what he accomplished at chewy and has no new tricks, he can easily get us to a $14-20 billion market cap with $8-10 billion in future revenue. That yeilds a post-turnaround share price of at least $200.</p>\n\n<p>If we go further than this and assume Cohen can permanently increase GME&#39;s gross margins (digital sales of exclusive games), the sky is the limit.
