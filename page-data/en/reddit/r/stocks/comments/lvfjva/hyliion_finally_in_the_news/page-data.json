It&#39;s got a longer range, better cost efficiency, and higher payload tolerance than diesel and all other EVs currently on the market.  The battery charges in less than 8 mins.  Production starts this year for early adopters and full production next year.  Unit is cost competitive with current diesel models.</p>\n\n<p>Look into it, let me know what you think.  Always love feedback, DD.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been holding for a while now, been pretty flat for me but I had the company valued at $220 in 10 years with a EV of 30B in the same time with a market share of 20% and a EBITDA multiplier of 15x (common in this market).  Conservative estimates in my opinion.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lvfjva/hyliion_finally_in_the_news/","title":"Hyliion - Finally in the News","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-02T00:50:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-02 00:50","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lvfjva","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lvfjva/hyliion_finally_in_the_news/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lvfjva/hyliion_finally_in_the_news/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Ok-Midnight9757","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Midnight9757","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Ok-Midnight9757","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Hyliion - 最后在新闻中","the_new_excerpt":"https://money.yahoo.com/hyliion-ceo-bringing-electrified-solutions-165330102.html\n\n\n\n他在这次采访中真的做得很好，这对公司来说是个不可思议的消息。\n它的股票价格，和地球。我需要这个。\n\n对于任何感兴趣的人来说，他们提供了一个完全的电动半自动车和它的充电。\n车上通过...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Hyliion - 最後在新聞中","the_new_excerpt":"https://money.yahoo.com/hyliion-ceo-bringing-electrified-solutions-165330102.html\n\n\n\n他在這次採訪中真的做得很好，這對公司來說是個不可思議的消息。\n它的股票價格，和地球。我需要這個。\n\n對於任何感興趣的人來說，他們提供了一個完全的電動半自動車和它的充電。\n車上通過...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m36r8m","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m36r8m/had_to_do_it/","title":"Had to do it","date":"March 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"不得不这么做","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"不得不這麼做","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m35pky","excerpt":"Statements from the media saying how inflation fears are kept in check due to\nlower interest rates, and how inflation causes growth stocks to fall make no\nsense.\n\nHere's why...
