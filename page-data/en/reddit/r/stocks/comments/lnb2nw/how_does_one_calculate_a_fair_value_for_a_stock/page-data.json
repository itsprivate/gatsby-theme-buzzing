TLDR: how do you arrive at a target price?</p>\n\n<p>So I’m trying to learn how to get better at DD, and I’m hitting a bit of a snag, namely how to calculate the <del>‘fair value’</del> <em>target price</em> of a stock. </p>\n\n<p>Most of my analysis in the past has been pretty hand-wavy, e.g. Green Energy = the future, duh, so one stock green energy company please! Most of my bets have paid off handsomely, but the recent downturn in green energy/EVs/ biotech has forced me to question what a “reasonable” share price is for a company. Obviously there’s a bit of a guessing game here, but it seems like one could arrive at a ballpark <del>‘fair’</del> <em>target</em> value based on the size of the market, the company’s dominance within that market, and the market’s/company’s growth potentials. Those values, relative to the market cap, should allow for a back-of-the envelope guesstimate of <del>fair</del> <em>target</em> stock price. So my question is, is there a relatively straightforward relationship here? </p>\n\n<p>As a example, here’s <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/augmented-reality-market\">a recent report about the augmented reality market and its growth potential</a>, and here are some values mentioned  in it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Market size value in 2021 = USD 26.75 billion</li>\n<li>Revenue forecast in 2028 = USD 340.16 billion</li>\n<li>Growth Rate = CAGR of 43.8% (2021 to 2028)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now let’s say I’m looking at KOPN, which makes wearable AR devices like Google glasses, displays in fighter pilot helmets, and AR-enabled displays for surgeons. They currently have a market cap of $860M, with a share price of ~$10. Is this currently overvalued (has the potential growth already been “priced into” the current share price, as the cool kids like to say), or is it still undervalued and now is a good time to stock up on shares?</p>\n\n<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lnb2nw/how_does_one_calculate_a_fair_value_for_a_stock/","title":"How does one calculate a ‘fair’ value for a stock?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-19T19:26:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-19 19:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lnb2nw","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnb2nw/how_does_one_calculate_a_fair_value_for_a_stock/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnb2nw/how_does_one_calculate_a_fair_value_for_a_stock/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"discodropper","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/discodropper","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"discodropper","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如何计算股票的 \"公允 \"价值？","the_new_excerpt":"编辑：'公平价值'可能是错误的术语。'目标价'可能是更\n准确。TLDR：如何得出目标价？\n\n所以我在努力学习如何更好的进行DD，我遇到了一点困难。\n即如何计算一只股票的 \"公允价值 \"目标价。\n\n我的大部分分析...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何計算股票的 \"公允 \"價值？","the_new_excerpt":"編輯：'公平價值'可能是錯誤的術語。'目標價'可能是更\n準確。TLDR：如何得出目標價？\n\n所以我在努力學習如何更好的進行DD，我遇到了一點困難。\n即如何計算一隻股票的 \"公允價值 \"目標價。\n\n我的大部分分析...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1366537201174069248","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1366537201174069248","title":"RT @jack: 🏦 now open https://t.co/8MoWvUDny0","date":"March 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @jack: 🏦现在开放https://t.co/8MoWvUDny0。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"🏦现在开放https://t.co/8MoWvUDny0。"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @jack: 🏦現在開放https://t.co/8MoWvUDny0。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"🏦現在開放https://t.co/8MoWvUDny0。"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lvbr0s","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvbr0s/its_fine_i_hate_money/","title":"It’s fine, I hate money.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 02, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"没关系，我讨厌钱。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"沒關係，我討厭錢。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lnb2nw","previousId":"TweetPost-1366537201174069248","nextId":"RedditPost-lvbr0s","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lnb2nw/how_does_one_calculate_a_fair_value_for_a_stock/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
