I work for a small business who put huge emphasis on everyone being friends and building a strong team, but it just means it hurts more when someone inevitably stabs you in the back. I&#39;m not saying go around and be a dick to people for no reason, but it&#39;s better to build relationships outside of work or in places where there aren&#39;t any politics or power imbalances.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Wow I didn&#39;t expect this to blow up and there&#39;s too many comments now for me to keep up with. It&#39;s kind of vindicating but also sad that so many people feel the same or have had similar negative experiences. For the &quot;my workplace isn&#39;t like this&quot; and &quot;my co-workers are my family&quot; people - I hope it stays that way for you, I really do, but I&#39;d maybe read some of the stories on this comment thread and be wary. It&#39;s better to be safe than sorry right?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/LifeProTips/comments/k3ywxq/lpt_no_matter_how_much_your_workplace_pushes_team/","title":"LPT: No matter how much your workplace pushes \"team building\" and \"family culture\" - remember, they're not your friends and it's still a workplace.","tags":["LifeProTips","reddit"],"date":"December 01, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-01T01:06:37.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-01 01:06","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"00c1acd5-38ee-52df-bced-f69fefa7d383","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/k3ywxq/lpt_no_matter_how_much_your_workplace_pushes_team/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/k3ywxq/lpt_no_matter_how_much_your_workplace_pushes_team/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"LifeProTips","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips","author":"Cat_mommie","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cat_mommie","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Cat_mommie","score":93875,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"LPT：不管你的工作场所多么提倡“团队建设”和“家庭文化”--记住，他们不是你的朋友，这仍然是一个工作场所。","the_new_excerpt":"不幸的是，我是通过艰苦的方式学到这一点的。我在一家小企业工作，他们把\n非常强调每个人都是朋友，并建立一个强大的团队，但这只是\n意味着当有人不可避免地在你背后捅刀子的时候会更痛。我没有\n无缘无故地说到处去当别人的混蛋，但这是…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"LPT：不管妳的工作場所多麽提倡“團隊建設”和“家庭文化”--記住，他們不是妳的朋友，這仍然是壹個工作場所。","the_new_excerpt":"不幸的是，我是通過艱苦的方式學到這壹點的。我在壹家小企業工作，他們把\n非常強調每個人都是朋友，並建立壹個強大的團隊，但這只是\n意味著當有人不可避免地在妳背後捅刀子的時候會更痛。我沒有\n無緣無故地說到處去當別人的混蛋，但這是…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-0c116117-3efa-5b1f-8c18-d62e66af9d4c","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/facepalm/comments/k3ww4h/whats_yours/","title":"What's yours?","date":"November 30, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你的是什么？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"妳的是什麽？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-9f1906b0-7d59-5d54-bbb6-ece0664b94b2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/funny/comments/k421ea/the_endless_cycle/","title":"the endless cycle","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"December 01, 2020","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"无尽的循环","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"無盡的循環","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-00c1acd5-38ee-52df-bced-f69fefa7d383","previousId":"RedditPost-0c116117-3efa-5b1f-8c18-d62e66af9d4c","nextId":"RedditPost-9f1906b0-7d59-5d54-bbb6-ece0664b94b2","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://changemyview.buzzing.cc","author":"Buzzing.cc","locale":"zh","title":"你可以改变我的想法吗？","iconUrl":"https://i.imgur.com/jVsw5Oq.png","defaultSocialImageUrl":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1624129591276-5b11185e7b42?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2739&q=80","shortTitle":"改变我的想法","description":"用中文浏览Reddit-Change My View的热帖","keywords":["buzzing","改变我的想法","reddit"],"telegram":"@buzzingcc","telegram_chat_id":"-1001406368978","menuLinks":[{"name":"每周精选","url":"/issues"}],"subscriptions":[{"name":"Twitter @buzzingcc","url":"https://twitter.com/buzzingcc","external":true},{"name":"Telegram @buzzingcc","url":"https://t.me/buzzingcc","external":true},{"name":"RSS","url":"/rss.xml","prefetch":false}],"social":[{"name":"Change My View","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/","external":true}],"localize":[{"locale":"en","title":"Buzzing on Change My View","shortTitle":"BuzzCMV","description":"See what's buzzing on Reddit Change My View Subreddit in your native language","keywords":["buzzing","Change My View","Change My Mind"],"menuLinks":[{"name":"Weekly Selection","url":"/en/issues"}],"social":[{"name":"Change My View","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/en/","external":true}]},{"locale":"zh-Hant","title":"你可以改變我的想法嗎？","shortTitle":"改變我的想法","description":"用中文瀏覽Reddit-Change My View的熱帖","keywords":["buzzing","改變我的想法","reddit"],"menuLinks":[{"name":"每週精選","url":"/zh-Hant/issues"}],"social":[{"name":"Change My View","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/zh-Hant/","external":true}]},{"locale":"ja","title":"気が変わってもらえますか？","shortTitle":"気が変わってもらえますか","description":"人気のReddit気が変わってもらえますか記事を日本語で閲覧","keywords":["buzzing","気が変わってもらえますか？"],"menuLinks":[]}]},"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/LifeProTips/comments/k3ywxq/lpt_no_matter_how_much_your_workplace_pushes_team/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
