It is definitely undervalued. With the current technologies and security improves, the risk of that kind of events is minimal.</p>\n\n<p>As for DNN:</p>\n\n<p>- Denison mines has found perhaps the best single uranium deposit in the world, the Canadian Saskatchewan. Their Phoenix project at Wheeler River has showed a 19.1% grade uranium sample. For context, between 0.5 and 1 is decent, while anything above 4 is considered great.</p>\n\n<p>- The discovered Uranium is close to the ground: their operating cost is an insanely cheap 9 dollars per pound.</p>\n\n<p>- An absolutely insane options increase. 150k Mar. 19 $2.50 call options added this week. The 99.9% call to put ratio, indicates to me someone knows something.</p>\n\n<p>Uranium mining may not be sexy, but if Uranium prices go from $30/lb back toward their all-time highs of $140/lb, I see DNN as being poised to capitalize massively.</p>\n\n<p>My perspective is long term bullish, but the options activity has me being very near-term bullish.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Uranium ores typically have very low yields of the element of between 0.1 to 0.2%, and some have concentrations lower than 0.05%. The Canadian Saskatchewan mines are the exception and have yields of more than 20% uranium.&quot; <a href=\"https://commodity.com/energy/uranium/\">https://commodity.com/energy/uranium/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/denison-announces-discovery-of-high-grade-uranium-mineralization-four-kilometres-northwest-of-phoenix-301216940.html\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/denison-announces-discovery-of-high-grade-uranium-mineralization-four-kilometres-northwest-of-phoenix-301216940.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.denisonmines.com/news/denison-announces-discovery-of-high-grade-uranium-122721/\">https://www.denisonmines.com/news/denison-announces-discovery-of-high-grade-uranium-122721/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DNN/options?date=1616112000\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DNN/options?date=1616112000</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.valuethemarkets.com/2021/01/25/perfect-conditions-for-uranium-to-shine/\">https://www.valuethemarkets.com/2021/01/25/perfect-conditions-for-uranium-to-shine/</a></p>\n\n<p>I´ve been long on DNN for a long time and I think the time of the Uranium bull run (especially DNN) is just starting.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a financial advice. 12000 @ 0.55</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/linom2/dnn_and_the_potential_uranium_bull_run/","title":"DNN and the potential Uranium bull run","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-13T04:13:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-13 04:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"linom2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/linom2/dnn_and_the_potential_uranium_bull_run/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/linom2/dnn_and_the_potential_uranium_bull_run/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"HomoSapien-sa","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HomoSapien-sa","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"HomoSapien-sa","score":91,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"DNN和潜在的 \"铀 \"牛市行情","the_new_excerpt":"我认为DNN的未来非常光明。\n\n铀市场有很好的基本面，最大的两家公司因为COVID（Kazatomprom和Cameco）而离开。\n\n- 最大的两家公司因为COVID（Kazatomprom和Cameco）而离开。\n分别为），铀的供应量不足，面临着回归到\n正常的生活，如果你不知道这意味着什么，不要投资于...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"DNN和潛在的 \"鈾 \"牛市行情","the_new_excerpt":"我認爲DNN的未來非常光明。\n\n鈾市場有很好的基本面，最大的兩家公司因爲COVID（Kazatomprom和Cameco）而離開。\n\n- 最大的兩家公司因爲COVID（Kazatomprom和Cameco）而離開。\n分別爲），鈾的供應量不足，面臨着迴歸到\n正常的生活，如果你不知道這意味着什麼，不要投資於...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26240339","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26240339","title":"10 Years of Open-Source Visualization: Did I learn anything from D3.js?","date":"February 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"开源可视化10年。我从D3.js中学到了什么吗？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"開源可視化10年。我從D3.js中學到了什麼嗎？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lqzrk7","excerpt":"It has become exceeding clear that a lot of new investors, and even some\nseasoned ones have overlooked some crucial aspects regarding finance as a whole.\nI am beginning a tutorial series on YT and here, starting with finance and\nworking our way up to investing/trading tools and strategies.
