I recognize we may be long past that point, but if it helps marginally, it’s worth saying.</p>\n\n<p>By way of background, I am a private equity investor with 10 years of experience. I have done due diligence on companies in industries in secular decline as well as true FOMO companies (Theranos – thankfully passed).</p>\n\n<p>I will avoid speaking about the short squeeze potential because 1) there are others more qualified and 2) it’s not how I personally invest and have been trained.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Long Thesis</strong></p>\n\n<p>If I were asked to evaluate GME from a take private perspective, there is a real thesis. There have been many comparisons to Blockbuster and traditional retail that I think underappreciate the difference in product. I still enjoy playing the N64 version of Super Smash Brothers that came out in 1999 when my childhood friends and I get together. Setting aside my nerdiness, the engagement and loyalty of a video game far exceeds that of a movie or apparel. The demographics are increasingly female (reportedly half). So GME is selling a product that can span generations and potentially engage entire families.</p>\n\n<p>Does this mean there needs to be a physical retailer? When Amazon emerged, there was a lot of speculation that physical retail was on its way out and Wal-Mart was becoming obsolete . And while the physical retail landscape has certainly changed, its total demise was hyperbole. Amazon acquired Whole Foods and Wal-Mart is thriving. Smaller retailers have had to shutter but the ones that have survived have emerged stronger. The point here is even if video games move to a digital delivery option, there remains room for a physical retailer of scale in the market. With a ~$4.5bn market cap, GME still has potential to grow with a slice of this industry.</p>\n\n<p>I’m sure people smarter than I have opinions as to what GME needs to do to stay relevant and value-add to game developers, but my view would be to evolve into experiential visits with excellent customer service (incidentally, Chewy’s competitive advantage). Video games have massive budgets with well-known characters. They are brands with potential for licensing of additional products. In addition, e-sports is quickly growing in popularity. The entire physical ecosystem around gaming has immense potential that we are in the early innings of.</p>\n\n<p>Last point, there is an experienced founder aligned with shareholders. I’ve seen great management teams make money in crappy industries and poor management teams lose money in great industries. People can take their own view on his capability, but his money is where his mouth is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Valuation</strong></p>\n\n<p>By any traditional metric, GME is currently overvalued. But part of the reason is because it’s so heavily shorted. The market’s ability to price discover is completely out of whack here. However, the potential for a near term bankruptcy is now gone (incidentally thanks in part to the short sellers) with a more resilient shareholder base than they could’ve expected. Yet shorts continue to stay the course / rise, presumably now holding onto the idea that the valuation will come back down to earth and help recoup their losses. If I pushed to invest in a company only to later discover that a meaningful part of my original thesis was broken, I would be fired much less advocate to invest more.</p>\n\n<p>Shorting a company only because it’s overvalued is not a good thesis in this market. GSX is very likely fraudulent. SFIX is a people based apparel retailer that will have to compete against its suppliers because they need to develop their own D2C platforms. There’s overvaluation everywhere and better short plays.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>This brings me to my ultimate point and hope. For those that have been long GME – congratulations. It’s impressive to see the support and conviction and it&#39;s made me rethink aspects of how I invest. I hope for the company’s sake you are long-term holders. For those thinking about getting in now for the short term, know that you are gambling. You do you, but you could also go to the roulette table and put your money on black which would be faster and more straightforward than trying to time this play.</p>\n\n<p>For those that are short, stop being your own worst enemy. This is not the hill in which I would choose to die on. There&#39;s enough notoriety now that new institutions and retail investors may come in to try and break you which undermines the market and the system we’re trying to support. I don’t have a position in GME nor do I intend to start one. I’d just like for some rationality to return to the market.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck to all!</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Real thesis for long-term investors. Shorts - stop escalating.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l43wrh/gme_the_long_thesis_and_hopeful_return_to_sanity/","title":"GME: The Long Thesis and Hopeful Return to Sanity","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-25T02:34:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-25 02:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l43wrh","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l43wrh/gme_the_long_thesis_and_hopeful_return_to_sanity/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l43wrh/gme_the_long_thesis_and_hopeful_return_to_sanity/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"HybridXY","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HybridXY","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"HybridXY","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME：长篇大论与希望回归理性","the_new_excerpt":"我写这篇文章的目的是想给公众带来一些理性。\n市场。我认识到我们可能早已过了那个阶段，但如果能稍微帮助一下。\n值得一提的是。\n\n背景介绍一下，我是一个私募股权投资人，有10年的经验。\n经验。我曾对公司进行过尽职调查...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME：長篇大論與希望迴歸理性","the_new_excerpt":"我寫這篇文章的目的是想給公衆帶來一些理性。\n市場。我認識到我們可能早已過了那個階段，但如果能稍微幫助一下。\n值得一提的是。\n\n背景介紹一下，我是一個私募股權投資人，有10年的經驗。\n經驗。我曾對公司進行過盡職調查...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lammyc","excerpt":"Aphria & Tilray Merger\n\nAphria and Tilray Combine to Create Largest Global Cannabis Company With Pro\nForma Revenue of C$874 Million\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/\n\n> Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria will receive\n> 0.8381 shares of Tilray for…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lammyc/aphriatilray_the_european_giant/","title":"Aphria/Tilray - The European Giant","date":"February 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Aphria/Tilray--欧洲巨无霸","the_new_excerpt":"Aphria和Tilray合并\n\nAphria和Tilray联合创建全球最大的大麻公司，并提供专业服务。\n基本收入8.74亿加元\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/\n\n> 根据该安排的条款，Aphria的股东将获得以下收益。\n> 0.8381股Tilray为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Aphria/Tilray--歐洲巨無霸","the_new_excerpt":"Aphria和Tilray合併\n\nAphria和Tilray聯合創建全球最大的大麻公司，並提供專業服務。\n基本收入8.74億加元\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/\n\n> 根據該安排的條款，Aphria的股東將獲得以下收益。\n> 0.8381股Tilray爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-25994051","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25994051","title":"We Test PCIe 4.0 Storage: The AnandTech 2021 SSD Benchmark Suite","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 02, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"我们测试PCIe 4.0存储。AnandTech 2021固态硬盘基准测试套件","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們測試PCIe 4.0存儲。AnandTech 2021固態硬盤基準測試套件","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l43wrh","previousId":"RedditPost-lammyc","nextId":"HnPost-25994051","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l43wrh/gme_the_long_thesis_and_hopeful_return_to_sanity/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
