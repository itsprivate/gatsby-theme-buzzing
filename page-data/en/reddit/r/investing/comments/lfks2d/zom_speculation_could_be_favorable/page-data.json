I started with a little bit of money, knowing I&#39;m quite ignorant of the market and not having a lot available to me in the first place. I dabbled in a few stocks, some admittedly memestocks though at only a couple shares in each to see how that plays out. However, there was one stock that I looked at seriously and decided to buy into, and that was $ZOM.</p>\n\n<p>I now own 50 shares of this stock, and over the past three days have watched it start to go really high and as of this writing is sitting at 26% and climbing growth (44% for today). I was surprised, because I decided to invest in it due to the nature of their business: bringing a much needed diagnostics service to the Veterinary industry to help all the cute puppies and kittens out there. This has spurred me to look more into why this stock is taking off as it is. </p>\n\n<p>My Google inquiries brought me to this news article: <a href=\"https://investorplace.com/2021/02/zom-stock-is-less-speculative-than-you-might-think/\">https://investorplace.com/2021/02/zom-stock-is-less-speculative-than-you-might-think/</a></p>\n\n<p>Some of the points they mention appear to be reasonably sound:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The market for these services is large, and expected to grow. In a press release, Zomedica cites “the diagnostics segment of the global companion animal market is expected to reach $2.8 billion by 2024.” To put that in context, that’s a nearly 10% compound annual growth rate. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a relatively new field that is expected to grow. They also point out that since Covid, there has been a rise in pet ownership, all of whom will need veterinary care for their beloved animals.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>...once TruForma is ready, Zomedica is taking steps to make sure it can get the product in the hands of veterinarians as soon as possible. The company has <a href=\"https://investors.zomedica.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zomedica-signs-truformatm-distribution-agreement-miller\">signed a distribution agreement</a> with Miller Veterinary Supply. Miller, supported by the company’s sales reps will cover the U.S. from Maine to Texas. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Their TruForma diagnostics is a sure thing to be released, and it looks like they already have the product&#39;s distribution secured. These various elements and it&#39;s continued stock growth, I admit have me a bit excited.</p>\n\n<p>What are your thoughts about this stock? Do you think it really has potential in the long run? Do you have the same or a different analysis? I look forward to hearing from everyone!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lfks2d/zom_speculation_could_be_favorable/","title":"$ZOM Speculation Could Be Favorable","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T20:53:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 20:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lfks2d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lfks2d/zom_speculation_could_be_favorable/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lfks2d/zom_speculation_could_be_favorable/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"KnightSpectral","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/KnightSpectral","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"KnightSpectral","score":46,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$ZOM猜测可能是有利的","the_new_excerpt":"三天前，我已经开始了我的第一次进入股票和投资（所以我\n恕我不懂行话）。) 我是从一点钱开始的。\n我知道自己对市场很不了解，也没有很多可供我利用的东西，在\n摆在第一位的。我涉足过几只股票，一些公认的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$ZOM猜測可能是有利的","the_new_excerpt":"三天前，我已經開始了我的第一次進入股票和投資（所以我\n恕我不懂行話）。) 我是從一點錢開始的。\n我知道自己對市場很不瞭解，也沒有很多可供我利用的東西，在\n擺在第一位的。我涉足過幾只股票，一些公認的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lnlh06","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnlh06/the_tendie_heist/","title":"The Tendie Heist","date":"February 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"天地大劫案","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"天地大劫案","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lneocp","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lneocp/pltr_up_7_premarket_also_the_number_of_wsb/","title":"PLTR up 7% premarket.
