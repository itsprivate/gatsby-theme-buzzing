The yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen from 0.93% at the beginning of December to above 1%. That means that since August of last year, when the 10-year yield hit 0.5%, interest rates have more than doubled.</p>\n\n<p>I have been looking at the 30y treasury bill rate and it seems like it is getting close to 2%</p>\n\n<p>I think there are a few reasons why this is important for investors. Firstly, it means debt is more expensive. For both the U.S. government and corporate borrowers, the cost of borrowing money is rising.</p>\n\n<p>Many analysts expect interest rates to continue to increase over the next year as a normal part of the economic cycle. When the economy is improving, it is essential to increase interest rates in order to avoid inflation spiralling out of control.</p>\n\n<p>Increased economic stimulus and borrowing could drive rates higher, and while this would be positive for many companies on a fundamental level, it is bound to hit equity valuations.</p>\n\n<p>This is one of the risks investors need to be aware of as interest rates continue to grind higher. In past market downturns, it wasn&#39;t as much of a concern, but this time around we have seen the rather unique phenomenon of a stock market bull run during a major global economic recession, which puts quite a different spin on things.</p>\n\n<p>The financial markets often do what we least expect as the highest probability scenarios are already priced in, and that&#39;s where I believe we stand today, with a majority of investors pricing in lower for longer on the interest rate front, which is evidenced by the euphoric price action in the large-cap growth stocks, including recent heavily oversubscribed shares of initial public offerings.</p>\n\n<p>Against this backdrop, commodity prices are signaling that we are on the cusp of higher than expected future inflationary pressures. This could very well lead to the specter of a burst broader equity market bubble and a burst bond market bubble that potentially casts a pall over the broader investment landscape?</p>\n\n<p>What are your thoughts about where is this going? I have been under the impression that the Fed will keep the interest rate low for many years but this seems contradict to what’s happening. Thoughts?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ktbzwn/is_interest_rate_going_higher/","title":"Is interest rate going higher?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-09T07:56:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-09 07:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ktbzwn","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ktbzwn/is_interest_rate_going_higher/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ktbzwn/is_interest_rate_going_higher/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"DaenyxBerlarys","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DaenyxBerlarys","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DaenyxBerlarys","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"利率会继续走高吗？","the_new_excerpt":"在过去的几周里，利率上升的速度已经开始快于\n预期的。10年期美国国债收益率从10年期国债收益率的0.93%上升到\n12月初升至1%以上。也就是说从去年八月份开始，\n当10年期公债收益率触及0.5%时，利率已经翻了一番以上。\n\nI…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"利率會繼續走高嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"在過去的幾周裏，利率上升的速度已經開始快於\n預期的。10年期美國國債收益率從10年期國債收益率的0.93%上升到\n12月初升至1%以上。也就是說從去年八月份開始，\n當10年期公債收益率觸及0.5%時，利率已經翻了一番以上。\n\nI…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ktf2ah","excerpt":"Roblox said earlier this week that it raised $520 million in private capital\nahead of a direct listing.\n\nThe company originally planned to go public in December but delayed its debut\nafter DoorDash and Airbnb soared more than expected out of the gates.\n\nThe company will trade on the New York Stock…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ktf2ah/roblox_expects_direct_listing_on_nyse_in_february/","title":"Roblox expects direct listing on NYSE in February","date":"January 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Roblox预计2月份在纽约证交所直接上市","the_new_excerpt":"Roblox本周早些时候表示，它通过私人资本筹集了5.2亿美元\n在直接上市之前。\n\n该公司原计划在12月上市，但推迟了首次亮相。\nDoorDash和Airbnb的涨幅超出预期。\n\n该公司将在纽约证券交易所(New York Stock…)交易。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Roblox預計2月份在紐約證交所直接上市","the_new_excerpt":"Roblox本週早些時候表示，它通過私人資本籌集了5.2億美元\n在直接上市之前。\n\n該公司原計劃在12月上市，但推遲了首次亮相。\nDoorDash和Airbnb的漲幅超出預期。\n\n該公司將在紐約證券交易所(New York Stock…)交易。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ktjf6b","excerpt":"There's been an influx of successes and high returns posted in this recent\nmarket, and whenever I look at these posts, I tend to get upset about missing\nthese opportunities.
