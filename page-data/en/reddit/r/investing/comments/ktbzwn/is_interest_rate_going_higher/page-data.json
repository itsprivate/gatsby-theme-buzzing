The yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen from 0.93% at the beginning of December to above 1%. That means that since August of last year, when the 10-year yield hit 0.5%, interest rates have more than doubled.</p>\n\n<p>I have been looking at the 30y treasury bill rate and it seems like it is getting close to 2%</p>\n\n<p>I think there are a few reasons why this is important for investors. Firstly, it means debt is more expensive. For both the U.S. government and corporate borrowers, the cost of borrowing money is rising.</p>\n\n<p>Many analysts expect interest rates to continue to increase over the next year as a normal part of the economic cycle. When the economy is improving, it is essential to increase interest rates in order to avoid inflation spiralling out of control.</p>\n\n<p>Increased economic stimulus and borrowing could drive rates higher, and while this would be positive for many companies on a fundamental level, it is bound to hit equity valuations.</p>\n\n<p>This is one of the risks investors need to be aware of as interest rates continue to grind higher. In past market downturns, it wasn&#39;t as much of a concern, but this time around we have seen the rather unique phenomenon of a stock market bull run during a major global economic recession, which puts quite a different spin on things.</p>\n\n<p>The financial markets often do what we least expect as the highest probability scenarios are already priced in, and that&#39;s where I believe we stand today, with a majority of investors pricing in lower for longer on the interest rate front, which is evidenced by the euphoric price action in the large-cap growth stocks, including recent heavily oversubscribed shares of initial public offerings.</p>\n\n<p>Against this backdrop, commodity prices are signaling that we are on the cusp of higher than expected future inflationary pressures. This could very well lead to the specter of a burst broader equity market bubble and a burst bond market bubble that potentially casts a pall over the broader investment landscape?</p>\n\n<p>What are your thoughts about where is this going? I have been under the impression that the Fed will keep the interest rate low for many years but this seems contradict to what’s happening. Thoughts?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ktbzwn/is_interest_rate_going_higher/","title":"Is interest rate going higher?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-09T07:56:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-09 07:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ktbzwn","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ktbzwn/is_interest_rate_going_higher/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ktbzwn/is_interest_rate_going_higher/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"DaenyxBerlarys","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DaenyxBerlarys","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DaenyxBerlarys","score":65,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"利率会继续走高吗？","the_new_excerpt":"在过去的几周里，利率上升的速度已经开始快于\n预期的。10年期美国国债收益率从10年期国债收益率的0.93%上升到\n12月初升至1%以上。也就是说从去年八月份开始，\n当10年期公债收益率触及0.5%时，利率已经翻了一番以上。\n\nI…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"利率會繼續走高嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"在過去的幾周裏，利率上升的速度已經開始快於\n預期的。10年期美國國債收益率從10年期國債收益率的0.93%上升到\n12月初升至1%以上。也就是說從去年八月份開始，\n當10年期公債收益率觸及0.5%時，利率已經翻了一番以上。\n\nI…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l2o9ys","excerpt":"Is this the time to buy Disney stock?
