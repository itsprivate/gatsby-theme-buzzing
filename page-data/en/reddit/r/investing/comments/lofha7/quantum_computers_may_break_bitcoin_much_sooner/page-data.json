One, a quantum computer can reverse engineer a wallet’s private key. A private key is generated at random, however, the public key is generated from the private key. A quantum computer can reverse engineer this process and take everyone’s Bitcoin. The second way is a quantum computer using both Grover’s and Shor’s algorithm could also “mine much faster than everyone else, and therefore an adversary could insert its own blocks and undermine the entire blockchain.” </p>\n\n<p>The general consensus as of now that quantum computers are 5 to 10 years away from breaking Bitcoin. However, some think this is only a couple years away.  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/decrypt.co/28560/quantum-computers-could-crack-bitcoins-encryption-by-2022%3famp=1\">But the threat could be far more imminent, Andersen Cheng, CEO of London-based cryptography company Post-Quantum, told Decrypt. In the intelligence world, which Cheng knows well—his company has worked with the counter-terrorism departments of organizations such as NATO, GCHQ, and NCSC—“there&#39;s been some evidence that it could well be around two years away.” </a> </p>\n\n<p>Approximately, a 4,000 qubits  quantum computer would be needed to break Bitcoin. <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023\">IBM promises a 1,000 qubit quantum computer by 2023</a> </p>\n\n<p>Also, Bitcoin maximalists suggest that new cryptography could be developed to fight against quantum computers. IMO, this is unlikely and at the very least would require a whole new quantum resistant consensus mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts? Do you think quantum computing is baseless FUD or do you think this is a serious concern?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lofha7/quantum_computers_may_break_bitcoin_much_sooner/","title":"Quantum computers may break Bitcoin much sooner than previously thought.
