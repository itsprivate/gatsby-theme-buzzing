My current portfolio is about 50/50 between QQQ and VOO. I normally buy in every month (about the same amount each month). Although I ended up buying in bulk during March and April of last year (and i tend to buy more if it’s been a relatively bad month). I’d like to hear your recommendations on what I should add to my portfolio (whether its index funds or individual stocks). Or if you have any advice related to method/timing. Any help is appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I am 27 years old and want to know if I am missing anything obvious that I should be in.
