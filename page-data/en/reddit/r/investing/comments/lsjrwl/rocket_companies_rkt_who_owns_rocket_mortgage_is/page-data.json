That makes it a great target for a (probably small) short squeeze, even if temporarily.</p>\n\n<p>Before you get too excited and start treating this like a Meme stock, read on about why this is a fantastic investment even without considering Short Interest.</p>\n\n<p>Rocket’s Q4 results COMPLETELY knocked it out of the park with $4.8 billion Adjusted Revenue (up 162% YOY) and $2.3 billion Adjusted Income (up 350% YOY). \n<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-experiences-explosive-growth-210500749.html\">See Yahoo article here</a></p>\n\n<p>Last month, Rocket also announced their new online National Mortgage Broker Directory that allows/assists people to find an in-person mortgage agent to help them purchase their home. It’s an alternative to fill the need of the people who prefer in-person contact over filling out overwhelming checkboxes and blanks online.</p>\n\n<p>They’re also now adding a Special dividend of $1.11/share, announced today with their earnings.</p>\n\n<p>RKT has been trading way under an average PT of $24.68 ($18-$35) by 14 analysts on Yahoo! Finance way before these new earnings results, so it was already trading at a discount.</p>\n\n<p>For the better part of the last 6 months it has traded consistently between $19-$24. It’s primed for a jump even without any of this news.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR- buy RKT. It’s cheap, is massively shorted and has GREAT financials. And a Special dividend. Plus, their name is Rocket</p>\n\n<p>*Edited for formatting</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lsjrwl/rocket_companies_rkt_who_owns_rocket_mortgage_is/","title":"Rocket Companies ($RKT), who owns Rocket Mortgage, is a slam dunk","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-26T01:57:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-26 01:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lsjrwl","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lsjrwl/rocket_companies_rkt_who_owns_rocket_mortgage_is/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lsjrwl/rocket_companies_rkt_who_owns_rocket_mortgage_is/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"MasterTmax","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MasterTmax","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"MasterTmax","score":429,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"拥有Rocket Mortgage的Rocket Companies($RKT)是个大热门。","the_new_excerpt":"火箭公司（股票代码RKT）是火箭抵押贷款，在线抵押贷款经纪公司。\n由Quicken Loans在2015年推出。\n\nRKT今天发布了第四季度财报，截至收盘时交易价格为\n19.90美元，AH期间截止到本帖，20.90美元。\n\n首先，我简单说一下，RKT已经被做空... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"擁有Rocket Mortgage的Rocket Companies($RKT)是個大熱門。","the_new_excerpt":"火箭公司（股票代碼RKT）是火箭抵押貸款，在線抵押貸款經紀公司。\n由Quicken Loans在2015年推出。\n\nRKT今天發佈了第四季度財報，截至收盤時交易價格爲\n19.90美元，AH期間截止到本帖，20.90美元。\n\n首先，我簡單說一下，RKT已經被做空... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26263085","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26263085","title":"Plain Text Protocols","date":"February 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"纯文本协议","locale":"zh"},{"title":"純文本協議","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ls9xit","excerpt":"So, I'm new to this like most people, right?
