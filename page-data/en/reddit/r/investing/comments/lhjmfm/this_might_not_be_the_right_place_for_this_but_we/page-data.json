Need a rant. </p>\n\n<p>I believe Wealthsimple’s recent marketing campaigns are predatory. I know there is a start-up definition for predatory marketing with a slightly positive connotation - this is not the case here. They are intentionally misleading new entrants to the world of investing. </p>\n\n<p>———————————————————</p>\n\n<p>I deleted my Wealthsimple trade account a while ago (moved to QT). They have gamified investing while pursuing a very important initiative of making investing for everyone. I want to be clear that i endorse this pursuit... However, they have now lost the plot. Entirely. </p>\n\n<p>Some examples of practises I see all day every day on almost every platform:</p>\n\n<p>• Misleading: account chart always green. Demonstrating gains only on weekly - yearly basis</p>\n\n<p>• Language: trading versus investing. Purposefully oversimplifying the investment process </p>\n\n<p>• Tickers: purposefully advertising hot tech stocks and the like </p>\n\n<p>• Branding: it’s a young person in a tik tok like video telling you to just download the app and makes those buys and sells. It’s turned the pursuit of learning about businesses and buying good ones into a tik tok trend</p>\n\n<p>• Positioning: commercials trying to make the founder seem like an outsider who is standing up to the big guys - this is not the case. You are trading all the time, you can’t walk your dog without checking your account or making a trade </p>\n\n<p>I could go on and on. It is so fucking annoying to see. </p>\n\n<p>What are people’s thoughts on this? Am I overreacting, this really scares me</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lhjmfm/this_might_not_be_the_right_place_for_this_but_we/","title":"This might not be the right place for this - but we should talk about WealthSimple’s marketing.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-11T17:39:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-11 17:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lhjmfm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lhjmfm/this_might_not_be_the_right_place_for_this_but_we/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lhjmfm/this_might_not_be_the_right_place_for_this_but_we/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Pure-arbitrage","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pure-arbitrage","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Pure-arbitrage","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"这可能不是合适的地方 - 但我们应该谈谈WealthSimple的营销。","the_new_excerpt":"版主：如果这个不合适，对不起。根据需要指点我其他地方。需要发发牢骚。\n\n我认为Wealthsimple最近的营销活动是掠夺性的。我知道有\n是掠夺式营销的创业定义，略带正能量的\n内涵--这里不是这样的。他们是故意...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這可能不是合適的地方 - 但我們應該談談WealthSimple的營銷。","the_new_excerpt":"版主：如果這個不合適，對不起。根據需要指點我其他地方。需要發發牢騷。\n\n我認爲Wealthsimple最近的營銷活動是掠奪性的。我知道有\n是掠奪式營銷的創業定義，略帶正能量的\n內涵--這裏不是這樣的。他們是故意...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1363831620030132228","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1363831620030132228","title":"Covid-19 hospitalizations in the US have declined 40 days in a row, down 57% from their peak on Jan 6.
