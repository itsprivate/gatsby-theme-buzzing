In just this year alone, we are looking towards several key major catalysts such as: </p>\n\n<p>- the SAFE act for MSOs to get access to banking  </p>\n\n<p>- uplisting to NYSE (US MSOs are currently traded as OTC leaving the vast majority of institutional investors on the outside looking in for now)</p>\n\n<p>- more states legalizing independently </p>\n\n<p>Decriminalization even without full legalization would be a major boon for growth but is not even necessary for growth to continue with more states legalizing and/or relaxing restrictions on MSOs. The 4 major players (Green Thumb, Cresco, Trulieve, and Curaleaf) are all on top in this. They maintained solid financials, limited debt/losses, huge expansion across all medical/recreational states and are almost certainly going to remain the big 4 post-legalization. A play across these 4 covers the majority of gains we&#39;ll see leading up to and after legalization. </p>\n\n<p>So we know who to invest in, what to look out for and when to expect it. We&#39;re past speculation for the cannabis market at this point. The industry is matured and ready to go big in 2021.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lr34do/the_us_cannabis_industry_play_is_more_attractive/","title":"The US cannabis industry play is more attractive than ever in 2021","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-24T07:57:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-24 07:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lr34do","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lr34do/the_us_cannabis_industry_play_is_more_attractive/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lr34do/the_us_cannabis_industry_play_is_more_attractive/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"TheCommonKoala","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheCommonKoala","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"TheCommonKoala","score":2485,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"2021年美国大麻产业玩法比以往更有吸引力","the_new_excerpt":"我看到很多人忽略了美国的大麻，这些天，所以我只是想。\n很快就把2021年的行业前景说清楚了。在短短\n仅在今年，我们就期待着几个关键的主要催化剂，如。\n\n- SAFE法案让MSO获得银行业务的机会。\n\n- 上架到...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2021年美國大麻產業玩法比以往更有吸引力","the_new_excerpt":"我看到很多人忽略了美國的大麻，這些天，所以我只是想。\n很快就把2021年的行業前景說清楚了。在短短\n僅在今年，我們就期待着幾個關鍵的主要催化劑，如。\n\n- SAFE法案讓MSO獲得銀行業務的機會。\n\n- 上架到...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lyl4vm","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyl4vm/my_gme_shares_this_week/","title":"My GME shares this week","date":"March 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"本周我的GME股票","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"本週我的GME股票","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26362443","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26362443","title":"Coursera S-1 IPO","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 06, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Coursera S-1 IPO","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Coursera S-1 IPO","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lr34do","previousId":"RedditPost-lyl4vm","nextId":"HnPost-26362443","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lr34do/the_us_cannabis_industry_play_is_more_attractive/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
