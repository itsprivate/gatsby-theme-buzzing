The stake purchase came a year after PayPal bought a 70% stake in GoPay for an undisclosed amount，then becoming the first foreign company licensed to provide online payment services in China.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>PayPal declined to comment.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>In taking full control of one of the smaller players in the world’s largest payment market, PayPal will compete with domestic payments giants Alipay, owned by Alibaba-affiliated Ant Group, and WeChat Pay, owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd, as China fully opens up its financial sector.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>The stake purchase also comes amid Beijing’s antimonopoly campaign against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and other Internet companies.  </p>\n\n<p>Last August, PayPal appointed Hannah Qiu as head of China business, responsible for formulating long-term strategy in the world’s second-biggest economy. Qiu was a former executive at insurer Ping An Group’s fintech unit OneConnect, according to PayPal’s website.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/china-paypal-stake/paypal-becomes-first-foreign-firm-in-china-with-full-ownership-of-payments-business-idUSL4N2JP14M\">Reuters</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kyb53b/paypal_becomes_first_foreign_firm_in_china_with/","title":"PayPal becomes first foreign firm in China with full ownership of payments business","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-16T10:08:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-16 10:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kyb53b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kyb53b/paypal_becomes_first_foreign_firm_in_china_with/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kyb53b/paypal_becomes_first_foreign_firm_in_china_with/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ChocolateTsar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChocolateTsar","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ChocolateTsar","score":65,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"PayPal成为中国首家拥有支付业务全部所有权的外资企业","the_new_excerpt":"我很惊讶这个没有发布，因为它似乎很有新闻价值，所以几个\n我想，晚几天总比不晚好。\n\n> 上海（路透社）--PayPal Holding Inc已成为第一家外国运营商。\n>拥有中国支付平台100%的控制权，据中国的。\n>政府数据，作为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"PayPal成爲中國首家擁有支付業務全部所有權的外資企業","the_new_excerpt":"我很驚訝這個沒有發佈，因爲它似乎很有新聞價值，所以幾個\n我想，晚幾天總比不晚好。\n\n> 上海（路透社）--PayPal Holding Inc已成爲第一家外國運營商。\n>擁有中國支付平臺100%的控制權，據中國的。\n>政府數據，作爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25771885","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25771885","title":"German police take down 'world's largest darknet marketplace'","date":"January 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"德国警方端掉 \"全球最大暗网市场","locale":"zh"},{"title":"德國警方端掉 \"全球最大暗網市場","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-25790530","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25790530","title":"Why cancer cells waste so much energy","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 16, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么癌细胞会浪费这么多能量","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼癌細胞會浪費這麼多能量","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kyb53b","previousId":"HnPost-25771885","nextId":"HnPost-25790530","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kyb53b/paypal_becomes_first_foreign_firm_in_china_with/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
