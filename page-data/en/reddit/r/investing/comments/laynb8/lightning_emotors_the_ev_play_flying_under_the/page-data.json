The CEO  <a href=\"https://i.redd.it/m42fdmpf7r861.jpg\">tweeted</a> a few weeks ago that merger should happen in Feb/March.</p>\n\n<p>Remember when  XL mooned to $30 a couple weeks ago, with a $60 bullish PT from  Citron(shocking) ? Lightning eMotors does everything they do but much  more. Lightning eMotors is delivering medium-duty Class 3-7  zero-emission vehicles (ZEV), specialize in fleet electrification with  their electric powertrains for familiar commercial vehicle platforms.  Their current <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medium-duty-electric-vehicle-share-210753672.html\">customers include <strong>Amazon, DHL, IKEA, Ford and ABC</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>ABC Companies, the <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210106005226/en/Lightning-eMotors-Delivers-First-All-Electric-Motorcoach-to-ABC-Companies-Receives-Order-for-200-Zero-Emissions-Vehicles\">leading coach/bus provider in US, is partnering with Lightning eMotors to launch first electric repowered motorcoach. $<strong>45M order</strong> on Jan 6, 2021.</a></p>\n\n<p>They are also the <a href=\"https://lightningemotors.com/plug-power-partners-with-lightning-systems-to-build-zero-emission-middle-mile-delivery-solution/\"><strong>EV Maker for PLUG Power</strong> to create the world&#39;s first electric Fuel Cell-Powered Class 6 truck</a>,  to target the Middle-Mile delivery solution. In terms of growth they  expect to deliver 20,000 ZEVs by 2025, with already enough purchase  orders to fulfill 100% of the 2020 and 2021 expected revenue.

Merger estimate in Feb/ early March.</p>\n\n<p>- They already have over 50% of market share on class 3-7 EV trucks.</p>\n\n<p>-  Production had already started in 2018, with already 100+ vehicles on  the road, compared to peers HYLN, XL, NKLA, they have ZERO vehicle on  the road, they haven&#39;t even started production yet.</p>\n\n<p>- FIXED contract for EV fleet orders with Amazon and IKEA, guaranteed revenue already for 2021</p>\n\n<p>-  FIXED contracts with Ford for shells and fleet electrification and  Romeo Power for batteries, with decreasing cost over the years.  guaranteed revenue already for 2021</p>\n\n<p>- <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/06/newsom-plan-includes-1point5-billion-to-boost-electric-hydrogen-vehicles.html\">California will include a $1.5 Billion stimulus package for EV and Hydrogen vehicles</a></p>\n\n<p>- Dems winning senate, EV will continue to go up.</p>\n\n<p>- <a href=\"https://i.redd.it/ouv65gdbkq961.jpg\">Going on Cramer&#39;s Mad Money soon</a></p>\n\n<p>- 25% of outstanding shares will be for SPAC investors, this is huge - as most SPACs only leave ~10% to retail investors.</p>\n\n<p>- <strong>GIK has options</strong></p>\n\n<p>IMO, GIK is under the radar because the other Giga SPAC is merging with some garbage (G I X, avoid it). It was also overshadowed by some other catalysts on the market recently. At this price, you have minimum  downside. This will run like XL, but better.</p>\n\n<p>I expect this to run high in FEB when it gets  closer to merger. However, it is difficult to time EV SPACs. The next  major catalysts would be: Cramer show appearance, Merger Vote date announcement, Actual Merger.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR:</p>\n\n<p>Lightning eMotors merging with GigaCapital3  (Ticker: <strong>GIK</strong>) - PT $20+.</p>\n\n<p>Positions:</p>\n\n<p>GIK - 200 Commons, 300 Warrants</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/laynb8/lightning_emotors_the_ev_play_flying_under_the/","title":"Lightning eMotors: The EV play flying under the radar","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T03:51:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 03:51","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"laynb8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/laynb8/lightning_emotors_the_ev_play_flying_under_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/laynb8/lightning_emotors_the_ev_play_flying_under_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Igettheshow89","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Igettheshow89","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Igettheshow89","score":58,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"闪电电动车。电动车的玩法在雷达下飞行","the_new_excerpt":"近日，GigCapital3（股票代码：G I K）宣布将与闪电合并。\neMotors在2021年第一季度。CEO在推特上写道[https://i.redd.it/m42fdmpf7r861.jpg]\n几周前，合并应该发生在2月/3月。\n\n还记得几周前XL涨到30美元，60美元的看涨PT... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"閃電電動車。電動車的玩法在雷達下飛行","the_new_excerpt":"近日，GigCapital3（股票代碼：G I K）宣佈將與閃電合併。\neMotors在2021年第一季度。CEO在推特上寫道[https://i.redd.it/m42fdmpf7r861.jpg]\n幾周前，合併應該發生在2月/3月。\n\n還記得幾周前XL漲到30美元，60美元的看漲PT... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lh2ng0","excerpt":"Apparently we’re all saying this now, but I am not a financial advisor and you\nshould do your own DD.
