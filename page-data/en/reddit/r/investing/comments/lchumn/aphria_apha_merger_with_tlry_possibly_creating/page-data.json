I am surprised more people have not jumped on this especially with the news on how US appears to be position cannibus legalization nationally and APHA is one of the first cannibus companies to actually produce a profit at the last earning report in 2020! I am not an investment advisor, but this seems like a great deal to me. Definitely check my math.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lchumn/aphria_apha_merger_with_tlry_possibly_creating/","title":"Aphria (APHA) Merger with TLRY Possibly Creating Arbitrage Opportunity","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-04T17:43:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-04 17:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lchumn","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lchumn/aphria_apha_merger_with_tlry_possibly_creating/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lchumn/aphria_apha_merger_with_tlry_possibly_creating/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"CryPast9432","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/CryPast9432","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"CryPast9432","score":388,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Aphria (APHA)与TLRY合并可能创造套利机会。","the_new_excerpt":"根据公司披露，APHA和TLRY的合并在2021年第二季度完成。\nAPHA的股东将以每股0.8381的价格将其股份转换为TLRY股票。\n新公司将保留TLRY的名称和股票代码。\n\n以下是昨晚收盘时的计算结果\n\n\n\n10股AHPA@16.60美元=166.00美元......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Aphria (APHA)與TLRY合併可能創造套利機會。","the_new_excerpt":"根據公司披露，APHA和TLRY的合併在2021年第二季度完成。\nAPHA的股東將以每股0.8381的價格將其股份轉換爲TLRY股票。\n新公司將保留TLRY的名稱和股票代碼。\n\n以下是昨晚收盤時的計算結果\n\n\n\n10股AHPA@16.60美元=166.00美元......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-linjhq","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/linjhq/dear_cnbc/","title":"Dear CNBC","date":"February 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"亲爱的CNBC","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"親愛的CNBC","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ling8b","excerpt":"\"Analysts have been calling the stock “overvalued” since the day they went\npublic, because they all keep comparing it to other car companies.
