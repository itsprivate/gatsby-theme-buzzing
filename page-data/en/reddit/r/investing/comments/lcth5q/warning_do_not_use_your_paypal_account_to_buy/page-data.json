Here&#39;s a quick example and a best case scenario too.  You use your PP account to buy $5000 worth of coin, their fee is a &quot;modest&quot; 1.5% for that (fees are higher below $1000) So you paid $75 right out of the gate, now let&#39;s say it has (a very unlikely) run and wow you doubled your money. You cash out at $10k, now PP takes another $150 (1.5%) to sell your coin. So your actual profits are $5000 and your PP fees are $250, boom they zinged you for <strong>5% of your total profits.</strong> And that&#39;s all best case scenario.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lcth5q/warning_do_not_use_your_paypal_account_to_buy/","title":"Warning: Do not use your Paypal account to buy Crypto unless you like giving your hard to come by profits away.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T03:19:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 03:19","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lcth5q","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcth5q/warning_do_not_use_your_paypal_account_to_buy/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcth5q/warning_do_not_use_your_paypal_account_to_buy/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"the_last_carfighter","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/the_last_carfighter","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"the_last_carfighter","score":176,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"警告：请不要使用你的Paypal账户购买Crypto。不要用你的Paypal账户去买Crypto 除非你喜欢把你那来之不易的利润拱手相让.","the_new_excerpt":"我想；\"它在那里，它很容易，我不想等待几天的钱。\n以最终落在另一个账户上。\" 他们的费用，表面上看并不\n似乎很可怕，直到你做数学。这里有一个快速的例子和一个最好的案例。\n的场景了。你用PP账户买了价值5000元的币，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"警告：請不要使用你的Paypal賬戶購買Crypto。不要用你的Paypal賬戶去買Crypto 除非你喜歡把你那來之不易的利潤拱手相讓.","the_new_excerpt":"我想；\"它在那裏，它很容易，我不想等待幾天的錢。\n以最終落在另一個賬戶上。\" 他們的費用，表面上看並不\n似乎很可怕，直到你做數學。這裏有一個快速的例子和一個最好的案例。\n的場景了。你用PP賬戶買了價值5000元的幣，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26125063","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26125063","title":"Ziglings: Learn the Zig programming language by fixing tiny broken programs","date":"February 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Ziglings。学习Zig编程语言，修复微小的破损程序。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Ziglings。學習Zig編程語言，修復微小的破損程序。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lj3uqn","excerpt":"Quotation from a morgan9471 [https://www.tradingview.com/u/morgan9471/] on\nTradingView, all the real DD goes to him:\n\n\n\n> This is my first idea I'm publishing to TradingView, so I'm eager to hear your\n> thoughts/criticism.\n> \n> The premise starts by stating that RIOT is highly correlated to BTC…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lj3uqn/dd_beware_of_riot_only_hearing_bad_things/","title":"DD: Beware of RIOT, only hearing bad things.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 13, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"DD：小心RIOT，只听过坏话。","the_new_excerpt":"引自morgan9471[https://www.tradingview.com/u/morgan9471/]关于：\nTradingView，所有真正的DD都归他。\n\n\n\n> 这是我第一次在TradingView上发表想法 所以我很想听听你的意见\n> 思想/批评。\n> \n> 前提是先说明RIOT与BTC高度相关... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"DD：小心RIOT，只聽過壞話。","the_new_excerpt":"引自morgan9471[https://www.tradingview.com/u/morgan9471/]關於：\nTradingView，所有真正的DD都歸他。\n\n\n\n> 這是我第一次在TradingView上發表想法 所以我很想聽聽你的意見\n> 思想/批評。\n> \n> 前提是先說明RIOT與BTC高度相關... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lcth5q","previousId":"HnPost-26125063","nextId":"RedditPost-lj3uqn","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lcth5q/warning_do_not_use_your_paypal_account_to_buy/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
