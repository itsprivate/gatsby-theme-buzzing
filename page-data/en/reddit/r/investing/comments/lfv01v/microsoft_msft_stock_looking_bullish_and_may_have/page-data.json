Earnings of $2.03 per share easily topped expectations by 39 cents, while revenue of $43.08 billion grew almost 17% year over year and beat estimates by more than $2.8 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Since the release of this earnings report, the stock value has been uncharacteristically quiet and only hovering around the $242 range.</p>\n\n<p>This made me investigate what’s going on and I discovered over 12 Microsoft executives acquired common stocks as recently reported on February 1st with the SEC Form 4 filings. I calculated 1,348,758 common stock shares that were acquired by Microsoft leadership in the last month.</p>\n\n<p>This potentially means MSFT will be releasing some big news in the near future. Potentially even as early as the next couple of weeks and I believe it will be either an M&amp;A, a new technology product, or a large government contract to make all these executives acquire common stocks at the all-time high price.</p>\n\n<p>I picked up 500 call options as I’m conservatively estimating their stocks might increase over $250 in the next two weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing to note is ARK Investment Management LLC reported a 30.67% increase in their ownership of MSFT / Microsoft Corp about three months ago. ARK does a lot better investigating potential disruptive technologies so they might have been previewed to some knowledge that helped them decide to increase their position that much.</p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice and just my opinions. Please do your own DD before making any financial investments. Also please share your thoughts and insights on this as I am also thinking about buying some long-term shares tomorrow depending on what others mention or discovered.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I replaced the word &quot;bought&quot; with &quot;aquired&quot; to reflect the verbiage of the SEC Form 4 filings. Apparently acquired could mean they were awarded, exercised options, or other means. I also removed the word &quot;insider&quot;.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lfv01v/microsoft_msft_stock_looking_bullish_and_may_have/","title":"Microsoft $MSFT stock looking bullish and may have a possible surprise announcement soon!","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T06:52:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 06:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lfv01v","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lfv01v/microsoft_msft_stock_looking_bullish_and_may_have/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lfv01v/microsoft_msft_stock_looking_bullish_and_may_have/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"BASEbelt","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BASEbelt","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"BASEbelt","score":108,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"微软$MSFT股价看涨，可能很快就会有惊喜公告!","the_new_excerpt":"去年，在2020年MSFT曾强势反弹43%，创下全年新高。\n\n1月26日发布的财报显示，MSFT的盈利和营收都超过了预期。\n连续第八个季度的预期，正如上期财报中所报告的那样。\n两周前的报告。每股收益2.03美元，轻松...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"微軟$MSFT股價看漲，可能很快就會有驚喜公告!","the_new_excerpt":"去年，在2020年MSFT曾強勢反彈43%，創下全年新高。\n\n1月26日發佈的財報顯示，MSFT的盈利和營收都超過了預期。\n連續第八個季度的預期，正如上期財報中所報告的那樣。\n兩週前的報告。每股收益2.03美元，輕鬆...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26188765","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26188765","title":"12 requests per second: A realistic look at Python web frameworks","date":"February 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"每秒12个请求：Python网络框架的真实面貌","locale":"zh"},{"title":"每秒12個請求：Python網絡框架的真實面貌","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ln1tbh","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ln1tbh/nice/","title":"nice.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 19, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"很好。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"很好。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lfv01v","previousId":"HnPost-26188765","nextId":"RedditPost-ln1tbh","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lfv01v/microsoft_msft_stock_looking_bullish_and_may_have/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
