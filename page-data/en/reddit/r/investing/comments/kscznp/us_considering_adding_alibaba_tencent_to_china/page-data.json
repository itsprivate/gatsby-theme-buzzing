The discussions were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.</p>\n\n<p>Shares in Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce firm, finished down 3.9% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange while Tencent, a gaming and social media behemoth, lost 4.7%. Alibaba’s U.S.-listed shares closed down just over 5% on the news on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>Some investors expressed skepticism, however, that Alibaba and Tencent would face long-term restrictions - given that they are worth a combined $1.3 trillion, widely held by U.S. investors and the likely reputational and financial hit to U.S. stock markets.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s a very bad policy and there’s enough money in Asia, lots and getting bigger, that one shouldn’t force these companies out of America,” said Thomas Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Investment Management in Toronto and an investor in the New York Stock Exchange. “Money and markets should be neutral.”</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-alibaba-tencent-idUSKBN29C04Y\">Reuters</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kscznp/us_considering_adding_alibaba_tencent_to_china/","title":"U.S. considering adding Alibaba, Tencent to China investment ban","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-07T17:07:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-07 17:07","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kscznp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kscznp/us_considering_adding_alibaba_tencent_to_china/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kscznp/us_considering_adding_alibaba_tencent_to_china/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Dagoru95","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dagoru95","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Dagoru95","score":386,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"美国考虑将阿里巴巴、腾讯纳入中国投资禁令","the_new_excerpt":"特朗普政府正在考虑增加科技巨头阿里巴巴和腾讯\n被列入据称由中国军方拥有或控制的公司黑名单，\n两名知情人士周三称。\n\n瞄准亚洲最有价值的两家公司将是美国总统唐纳德\n特朗普的…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國考慮將阿里巴巴、騰訊納入中國投資禁令","the_new_excerpt":"特朗普政府正在考慮增加科技巨頭阿里巴巴和騰訊\n被列入據稱由中國軍方擁有或控制的公司黑名單，\n兩名知情人士週三稱。\n\n瞄準亞洲最有價值的兩家公司將是美國總統唐納德\n特朗普的…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l1fcv1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1fcv1/bb_ready_for_the_moon/","title":"BB READY FOR THE MOON 🌙🚀🚀🚀","date":"January 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"BB READY FOR THE MOON 🌙🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"BB READY FOR THE MOON 🌙🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l1u6nd","excerpt":"Markets rose a stunning 1% today, and tech rose 2+% across the board.
