Individuals who purchase cryptocurrency with another cryptocurrency still have to report their transactions to the agency.</p>\n\n<p>The IRS began asking cryptocurrency users to disclose their transactions on their 2019 Individual tax returns.</p>\n\n<p>The cryptocurrency question on the 2020 return asks taxpayers if they received, sold, sent, exchanged or otherwise acquired any financial interest in any virtual currency. </p>\n\n<p>Some tax profesionals on Twitter complained the recent update on cryptocurrency purchases seems contradictory to the tax return question and will confuse taxpayers. Others welcomed the change, saying it provides more clarity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just a word of advice, even if you are not required to disclose your purchases, you might still want to keep a log with your purchase dates and cost basis for future reference.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lxqx6q/crypto_purchases_do_not_trigger_irs_reporting/","title":"Crypto purchases do not trigger IRS reporting","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-05T05:55:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-05 05:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lxqx6q","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lxqx6q/crypto_purchases_do_not_trigger_irs_reporting/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lxqx6q/crypto_purchases_do_not_trigger_irs_reporting/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Reddit_Man71","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit_Man71","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Reddit_Man71","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"购买加密货币不会触发国税局的报告。","the_new_excerpt":"https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/crypto-purchases-dont-trigger-irs-reporting-requirement?context=search&index=0\n\n>只用美元和其他实物购买加密货币的个人。\n>货币在2020年不需要向国税局披露，这个申报季。\n> 该机构...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"購買加密貨幣不會觸發國稅局的報告。","the_new_excerpt":"https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/crypto-purchases-dont-trigger-irs-reporting-requirement?context=search&index=0\n\n>只用美元和其他實物購買加密貨幣的個人。\n>貨幣在2020年不需要向國稅局披露，這個申報季。\n> 該機構...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26477999","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26477999","title":"Docker Raises $23M","date":"March 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Docker融资2300万美元","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Docker融資2300萬美元","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26475519","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26475519","title":"In-kernel WireGuard is on its way to FreeBSD and the pfSense router","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 16, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"内核的WireGuard已经在FreeBSD和pfSense路由器的路上了。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"內核的WireGuard已經在FreeBSD和pfSense路由器的路上了。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lxqx6q","previousId":"HnPost-26477999","nextId":"HnPost-26475519","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lxqx6q/crypto_purchases_do_not_trigger_irs_reporting/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
