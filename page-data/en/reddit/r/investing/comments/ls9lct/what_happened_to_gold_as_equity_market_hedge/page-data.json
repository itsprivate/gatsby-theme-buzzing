Also with the big correction in feb 2020 gold also went down quite alot. Anybody can explain why this happens?</p>\n\n<p>And no, this has nothing to do with money flowing from gold into bitcoin. The gold market is still x times bigger than bitcoin and when monday and tuesday the stock market and gold went down, so did bitcoin so that&#39;s not the reason.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I read somewhere is that it might have to do with (leveraged) hedge funds getting more margin calls when equity markets go down and in order to post cash collateral they have to sell other assets like gold.</p>\n\n<p>Not sure if that makes sense or is even the main reason so why is gold selling off, which is even more surpring since gold has also always functioned as inflation hedge. With investors worrying about inflation lately you would think gold would benifit but even that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ls9lct/what_happened_to_gold_as_equity_market_hedge/","title":"What happened to gold as equity market hedge","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-26T05:39:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-26 05:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ls9lct","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ls9lct/what_happened_to_gold_as_equity_market_hedge/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ls9lct/what_happened_to_gold_as_equity_market_hedge/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ThinkBigger01","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ThinkBigger01","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ThinkBigger01","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"作为股市避险工具的黄金怎么了？","the_new_excerpt":"从历史上看，当股市下跌时，黄金总是起到避险的作用。\n或通货膨胀上升，但我注意到在最近的一年，这不再是。\n的情况下。\n\n今天又有股市抛售，但黄金也跌了1%以上。\n另外随着2020年2月的大调整，黄金也...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"作爲股市避險工具的黃金怎麼了？","the_new_excerpt":"從歷史上看，當股市下跌時，黃金總是起到避險的作用。\n或通貨膨脹上升，但我注意到在最近的一年，這不再是。\n的情況下。\n\n今天又有股市拋售，但黃金也跌了1%以上。\n另外隨着2020年2月的大調整，黃金也...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ls372e","excerpt":"Have a general question?
