Looking for a pure play in the streaming service I came across CuriosityStream. Basically the platform offers documentaries about science, history, politics, etc...  and they have over 3000+ titles in the platform. The founder is John Hendricks, founder and former chairman of Discovery.</p>\n\n<p>After digging a little bit I was surprised to see that despite having 13M subscribers total revenue for Q3 was only $8.9M, giving an ARPU of only $0.15 which seems ridiculous for the amount of value you are getting. It seems like a good amount of the subscriber base comes from bundled packages at a heavy discount. They are looking for exposure while growing at all costs. Here are some key point:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The company has no debt and $180M cash in the balance sheet.</li>\n<li><strong>The company went from 2M bundled subscriptions  in Q1 2019 to 13M in Q3 2020</strong></li>\n<li>Over 60% gross margin</li>\n<li>They project 10x growth by 2025 with $400M in revenues</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Giving the uncertainty of the current market environment it seems pretty safe to buy something that sells $1 a month subscriptions and is disrupting an industry, targeting a more sophisticated  costumers instead of the average becky who likes stranger things. The last time John Hendricks created something (Discovery) he turned a $5M investment into a $32B company before stepping down and creating CuriosityStream.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to hear your thoughts on the comment section and discuss if in fact CuriosityStream is already fairly valued, undervalued or maybe overvalued.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Side note:</em></strong> John Hendricks has been buying shares this month increasing his position by 21%.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kmgwmt/is_curiositystream_streaming_platform_grossly/","title":"Is CuriosityStream (streaming platform) grossly undervalued at $550M with already 13M paying subscribers?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 29, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-29T19:48:30.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-29 19:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kmgwmt","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kmgwmt/is_curiositystream_streaming_platform_grossly/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kmgwmt/is_curiositystream_streaming_platform_grossly/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"bearsgotoalaskanstfu","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bearsgotoalaskanstfu","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"bearsgotoalaskanstfu","score":395,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"已经有1300万付费订户的CuriosityStream(流媒体平台)价值5.5亿美元，是不是被严重低估了？","the_new_excerpt":"流媒体行业最近通过所有的新闻获得了大量的曝光率\n来自迪士尼+和HBO MAX。在流媒体服务中寻找纯粹的机会\n偶然发现了好奇心溪流。基本上，该平台提供关于以下内容的纪录片\n科学、历史、政治等。他们有3,000多种图书…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"已經有1300萬付費訂戶的CuriosityStream(流媒體平臺)價值5.5億美元，是不是被嚴重低估了？","the_new_excerpt":"流媒體行業最近通過所有的新聞獲得了大量的曝光率\n來自迪士尼+和HBO MAX。在流媒體服務中尋找純粹的機會\n偶然發現了好奇心溪流。基本上，該平臺提供關於以下內容的紀錄片\n科學、歷史、政治等。他們有3,000多種圖書…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25569148","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25569148","title":"Against Essential and Accidental Complexity","date":"December 29, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"对抗本质和偶然的复杂性","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對抗本質和偶然的複雜性","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-25568668","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25568668","title":"Show HN: LinkAce – Your self-hosted, FOSS bookmark archive","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"December 29, 2020","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"HN新产品：LinkAce-您的自托管自由/开源软件书签档案","locale":"zh"},{"title":"HN新產品：LinkAce-您的自託管自由/開源軟件書籤檔案","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kmgwmt","previousId":"HnPost-25569148","nextId":"HnPost-25568668","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kmgwmt/is_curiositystream_streaming_platform_grossly/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","1684688348","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","386998304"]}
