For anyone who is familiar with golf or Topgolf&#39;s venues, I believe this merger makes ELY&#39;s stock very undervalued and I wanted to do some DD and analysis to come up with a reasonable price target. </p>\n\n<p>Callaway is currently projected to do $1.55B in revenue in 2020 with an expected growth rate of 10.5% for future years while Topgolf will do revenues of about $1.1B while experiencing a 30% growth rate since 2017. This 30% growth can continue for many years to come as the company is still rapidly growing and expanding its venues. Also, over half of Topgolf&#39;s customers consider themselves non-golfers so this gives Callaway a huge market to bring in new customers to their golf apparel and equipment revenue streams. Source: <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/business/local-companies/2020/10/27/topgolf-is-merging-with-callaway-in-a-deal-valued-at-2-billion/\">https://www.dallasnews.com/business/local-companies/2020/10/27/topgolf-is-merging-with-callaway-in-a-deal-valued-at-2-billion/</a></p>\n\n<p>For my analysis, I projected Callaway and Topgolf&#39;s revenues out to 2025 with the above mentioned projected growth rates, and came to a combined revenue estimate of $6.63B in 2025. I then discounted this revenue back to current year at 15% to get a number of about $3.3B. With ELY currently trading at a P/S ratio of 1.51, this would imply a target market cap of about $4.98B with the discounted revenues and the current P/S ratio. The current market cap of ELY with the stock trading at $27/share is $2.54B. <strong>Based on my analysis this gives a potential upside of 96% with a price target of $52.85.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thoughts??</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kzcgka/callaway_golf_ticker_ely_analysis_and_price/","title":"Callaway Golf (Ticker ELY) Analysis and Price Target after TopGolf Acquisition","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-18T13:22:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-18 13:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kzcgka","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kzcgka/callaway_golf_ticker_ely_analysis_and_price/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kzcgka/callaway_golf_ticker_ely_analysis_and_price/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Healthy-Cash8610","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Healthy-Cash8610","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Healthy-Cash8610","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"卡拉威高尔夫(股票代码ELY)分析和收购TopGolf后的目标价。","the_new_excerpt":"早在10月份，卡拉威高尔夫公司就宣布了与Topgolf的合并，这就是\n估值为20亿美元。对于熟悉高尔夫或Topgolf的场地的人来说。\n我相信这次合并使得ELY的股票被非常低估，我想做一些。\n丈量和分析，得出一个合理的价格... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"卡拉威高爾夫(股票代碼ELY)分析和收購TopGolf後的目標價。","the_new_excerpt":"早在10月份，卡拉威高爾夫公司就宣佈了與Topgolf的合併，這就是\n估值爲20億美元。對於熟悉高爾夫或Topgolf的場地的人來說。\n我相信這次合併使得ELY的股票被非常低估，我想做一些。\n丈量和分析，得出一個合理的價格... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1354468038452637699","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1354468038452637699","title":"\"You may think it’s funny to value GameStop like it’s 2007 again and hurt some hedge funds in the process, but you might not think the next target is funny, nor the next, nor the next.\" https://t.co/ZqF8OrADGd","date":"January 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"\"你可能觉得把GameStop的价值看得像2007年一样又很有趣，并在这个过程中伤害了一些对冲基金，但你可能不会觉得下一个目标很有趣，也不会觉得下一个目标很有趣。\" https://t.co/ZqF8OrADGd。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"\"你可能覺得把GameStop的價值看得像2007年一樣又很有趣，並在這個過程中傷害了一些對沖基金，但你可能不會覺得下一個目標很有趣，也不會覺得下一個目標很有趣。\" https://t.co/ZqF8OrADGd。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l6c5tg","excerpt":"To the SEC retards in this sub: go fuck yourself.
