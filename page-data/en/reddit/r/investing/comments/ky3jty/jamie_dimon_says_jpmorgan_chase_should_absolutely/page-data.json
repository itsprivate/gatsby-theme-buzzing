We’ve just got to get quicker, better, faster. ... As you look at what we’ve done, you’d say we’ve done a good job, but the other people have done a good job, too.”  </p>\n\n<p>Dimon’s blunt assessment was in response to questions from analysts including Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo who pointed out that with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/disruptors-paypal-and-square-surpass-wall-street-giants-including-goldman-sachs-in-market-cap.html\">rich, tech-like valuations</a>, fintech players have “trounced” the traditional banks in recent years.  </p>\n\n<p>Dimon said he sent his deputies a list of global competitors, and that PayPal, Square, Stripe, Ant Financial as well as U.S. tech giants including <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN\">Amazon</a>, Apple and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GOOGL\">Google</a> were names the bank needs to keep an eye on. The rivals are also clients of JPMorgan’s commercial and investment banking in many cases, he added.  </p>\n\n<p>Competition will be particularly tight in the world of payments, he said: “I expect to see very, very tough, brutal competition in the next 10 years,” Dimon said. “I expect to win, so help me God.”  </p>\n\n<p>Dimon added that in some cases, the new players were “examples of unfair competition” that the bank would do something about eventually. He included players that take advantage of richer debit-card revenue for small banks and firms Dimon accused of not taking precautions against money laundering.  </p>\n\n<p>He specifically called out Plaid, the payments start-up whose acquisition by Visa recently collapsed, saying “people who improperly use data that’s been given to them, like Plaid.”  </p>\n\n<p>Plaid CEO Zach Perret declined to directly respond to the accusation during an <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/15/plaid-ceo-on-how-its-5-point-3-billion-deal-with-visa-fell-through.html\">interview</a> with CNBC’s David Faber, adding that Plaid is spending time with the bank on a partnership.  </p>\n\n<p>When contacted for further comment, a Plaid spokeswoman said the company is “focused on ensuring people have access to their own financial information so they can securely share it with permission in order to use the fintech apps they choose.”  </p>\n\n<p>She added that “data privacy and security are core to everything we do, including the data exchange agreements we have with JPMorgan Chase among many other banks.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/jamie-dimon-says-jpmorgan-chase-should-absolutely-be-scared-s-less-about-fintech-threat.html\">Original CNBC article</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ky3jty/jamie_dimon_says_jpmorgan_chase_should_absolutely/","title":"Jamie Dimon says JPMorgan Chase should absolutely be ‘scared s---less’ about fintech threat","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-16T00:04:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-16 00:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ky3jty","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ky3jty/jamie_dimon_says_jpmorgan_chase_should_absolutely/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ky3jty/jamie_dimon_says_jpmorgan_chase_should_absolutely/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ChocolateTsar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChocolateTsar","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ChocolateTsar","score":1287,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"杰米-戴蒙表示，摩根大通绝对应该对金融科技的威胁 \"不害怕\"。","the_new_excerpt":"> 关键点\n> \n> 杰米-戴蒙对3.4万亿美元银行业巨头管理团队的寄语。\n>摩根大通。害怕金融科技的竞争对手。\n> \n> \"我们绝对不应该害怕，\"Dimon告诉分析师。\n> \n> 迪蒙表示，他给自己的副手发了一份全球竞争对手的名单，并...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"傑米-戴蒙表示，摩根大通絕對應該對金融科技的威脅 \"不害怕\"。","the_new_excerpt":"> 關鍵點\n> \n> 傑米-戴蒙對3.4萬億美元銀行業巨頭管理團隊的寄語。\n>摩根大通。害怕金融科技的競爭對手。\n> \n> \"我們絕對不應該害怕，\"Dimon告訴分析師。\n> \n> 迪蒙表示，他給自己的副手發了一份全球競爭對手的名單，並...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kxyr30","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxyr30/leaked_fed_meeting/","title":"Leaked fed meeting","date":"January 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"美联储会议泄密","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"美聯儲會議泄密","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kxwxds","excerpt":"I'm starting to sink my teeth into Active Trader Pro, but I can't get around the\nfact that it's UI just feels a little clunky compared to what else is out there.\n\nRight now I'm comparing Active Trader Pro with Tradingview for the purposes of\nresearching and understanding my stocks.\n\nQuestion is:…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kxwxds/for_those_that_use_fidelity_is_active_trader_pro/","title":"For those that use Fidelity: is Active Trader Pro worth the learning curve, or is it better to do your research on websites with more modern, clean UIs (ex. tradingview) ?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 16, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"对于那些使用Fidelity的人：Active Trader Pro是否值得学习，还是最好在更现代、更干净的用户界面的网站上做研究（如tradingview）？","the_new_excerpt":"我开始对Active Trader Pro感兴趣，但我无法绕过这个问题。\n事实上，它的用户界面和其他的软件相比，感觉有点笨拙。\n\n现在我正在比较Active Trader Pro和Tradingview，目的在于\n研究和了解我的股票。\n\n问题是：...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對於那些使用Fidelity的人：Active Trader Pro是否值得學習，還是最好在更現代、更乾淨的用戶界面的網站上做研究（如tradingview）？","the_new_excerpt":"我開始對Active Trader Pro感興趣，但我無法繞過這個問題。\n事實上，它的用戶界面和其他的軟件相比，感覺有點笨拙。\n\n現在我正在比較Active Trader Pro和Tradingview，目的在於\n研究和了解我的股票。\n\n問題是：...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-ky3jty","previousId":"RedditPost-kxyr30","nextId":"RedditPost-kxwxds","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ky3jty/jamie_dimon_says_jpmorgan_chase_should_absolutely/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
