They&#39;ve acquired &quot;917 million in debt and equity financing.&quot; During the short interval that the market has been open, I&#39;ve seen AMC fluctuate from 4.60-something to 4.13. Last time it got this high, it ended up hemorrhaging. That was based on the news of a vaccine, if I recall. But perhaps this rise isn&#39;t quite as much a mirage, as it&#39;s actually on the strength not merely of expectations and hopes, but an actual, tangible financial development.</p>\n\n<p>So, what do you all think? Is AMC stock going to soar or at least make a steady turn around? One thing I&#39;ll say is, they need to actually start putting out movies that bring people to the theaters. And hopefully hammer out exclusive deals that don&#39;t involve sharing with streaming platforms. Godzilla vs Kong is on the horizon and perhaps that can rake in some old-fashioned blockbuster numbers. But they need to start putting tushes in seats somehow.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l4pidq/good_news_from_amc/","title":"Good news from AMC","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T06:55:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 06:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l4pidq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l4pidq/good_news_from_amc/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l4pidq/good_news_from_amc/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"AcroyearOfSPartak","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/AcroyearOfSPartak","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"AcroyearOfSPartak","score":47,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"AMC的好消息","the_new_excerpt":"我相信你们大多数人都听说了，AMC股票今天大涨，原因是有消息说\nAMC已经获得了足够的资金，以维持 \"深陷2021年 \"的局面。\n的文章。他们已经获得了 \"9.17亿的债权和股权融资\"。在这期间。\n市场开盘时间很短，我看到AMC... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"AMC的好消息","the_new_excerpt":"我相信你們大多數人都聽說了，AMC股票今天大漲，原因是有消息說\nAMC已經獲得了足夠的資金，以維持 \"深陷2021年 \"的局面。\n的文章。他們已經獲得了 \"9.17億的債權和股權融資\"。在這期間。\n市場開盤時間很短，我看到AMC... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26014921","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26014921","title":"Yellen Accepted $700K Speaking Fees from Citadel; Will Not Recuse from Hearing","date":"February 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"耶伦接受花旗银行70万美元演讲费；不会回避听证会。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"耶倫接受花旗銀行70萬美元演講費；不會迴避聽證會。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26013715","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26013715","title":"Show HN: Haven – Run a private website to share with only the people you choose","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 03, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"显示HN：Haven - 运行一个私人网站，只与您选择的人分享。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"顯示HN：Haven - 運行一個私人網站，只與您選擇的人分享。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l4pidq","previousId":"HnPost-26014921","nextId":"HnPost-26013715","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l4pidq/good_news_from_amc/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
