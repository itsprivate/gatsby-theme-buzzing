Coinbase won’t receive any proceeds from shareholders selling their stock during the offering, the prospectus said. Goldman Sachs , J.P. Morgan Securities, Allen &amp; Co., and Citigroup Global Markets are acting as financial advisors on the deal. Coinbase plans to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol “COIN.”</p>\n\n<p>Companies typically have to wait 15 days to commence a roadshow for their IPOs after making the prospectus public. This means Coinbase could launch the direct listing as soon as next month. Coinbase isn’t conducting a typical roadshow, but may host one or more investor days, the prospectus said. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/coinbase-could-go-public-as-soon-as-march-51614270033\">https://www.barrons.com/articles/coinbase-could-go-public-as-soon-as-march-51614270033</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lsat2y/coinbase_could_go_public_as_soon_as_this_march/","title":"Coinbase Could Go Public as Soon as This March","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-25T19:14:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-25 19:14","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lsat2y","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lsat2y/coinbase_could_go_public_as_soon_as_this_march/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lsat2y/coinbase_could_go_public_as_soon_as_this_march/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ExcellentNoThankYou","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ExcellentNoThankYou","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ExcellentNoThankYou","score":315,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Coinbase最快可能在今年3月上市","the_new_excerpt":"Coinbase Global周四公开了其备受关注的招股说明书。\n首次公开募股，为该公司可能会在\n3月份。\n\nCoinbase，其使命是为每个人建立一个开放的金融体系。\n计划采用直接上市的方式来挖掘公众股...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Coinbase最快可能在今年3月上市","the_new_excerpt":"Coinbase Global週四公開了其備受關注的招股說明書。\n首次公開募股，爲該公司可能會在\n3月份。\n\nCoinbase，其使命是爲每個人建立一個開放的金融體系。\n計劃採用直接上市的方式來挖掘公衆股...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lsa4bj","excerpt":"Hi guys, I’m relatively novice (8 months of investing).
