Honestly these should all just be comments in existing threads and us mods can&#39;t spend all day deleting repetitive posts so we&#39;ll keep things locked for a bit.</p>\n\n<p>As always, if you make a post that you think is worthwhile, or is on another topic worth discussing please message us and we can approve. </p>\n\n<p>Side note: obviously we don&#39;t have the mod bandwith for this sort of stuff, in every &quot;meta&quot; post I&#39;ve made in the last year I&#39;ve asked for mod volunteers and have gotten zero.  Reddit sent us an automated message yesterday because our traffic spiked so much (automated, because admins don&#39;t give a fuck).  I&#39;m going to leave a comment with some additional thoughts on that below.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to GME, we&#39;ll have a thread coming soon, <a href=\"/u/jn_ku\">/u/jn_ku</a>&#39;s posts have been popular so far so his 3rd installment will be allowed shortly. - and that&#39;s the thread for today unless there&#39;s some MAJOR news item.  We&#39;re still gonna keep the posts filtered because nobody pays attention to megathreads anyway. </p>\n\n<p><strong>For this thread - please feel free to have meta discussion on the subreddit and traffic, offer up suggestions, call the mods assholes, etc.  Please do not discuss GME or anything related here - that goes in the follow up megathrad</strong></p>\n\n<p>And for the love of christ please stop asking us for access to WSB.
