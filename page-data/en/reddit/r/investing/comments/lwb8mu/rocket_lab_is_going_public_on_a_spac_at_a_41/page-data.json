Once the merger is done, Vector  Acquisition Corporation, the SPAC Rocket Lab is merging with, will  change its name to Rocket Lab USA, Inc, and the Nasdaq ticker symbol  will be <strong>RKLB</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The merger will provide Rocket Lab with up to $320 million from  Vector Acquisition’s account. In addition, a concurrent private  investment in public equity (PIPE) round, led by Vector Capital,  BlackRock and Neuberger Berman, will provide $470 million.</p>\n\n<p>The company will have $750 million in cash when the deal closes, fueling development of the company’s next rocket dubbed <strong>Neutron</strong>,  a fully reusable launch vehicle capable of lifting eight tons to orbit.  The rocket is “tailored for mega constellations, deep space missions  and human spaceflight,” the company said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://digesttime.com/2021/03/02/rocket-lab-is-going-public-on-a-spac-at-a-4-1-billion-valuation-and-unveils-a-new-rocket/\">https://digesttime.com/2021/03/02/rocket-lab-is-going-public-on-a-spac-at-a-4-1-billion-valuation-and-unveils-a-new-rocket/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lwb8mu/rocket_lab_is_going_public_on_a_spac_at_a_41/","title":"Rocket Lab is going public on a SPAC at a $4.1 billion valuation and unveils a new rocket","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-02T23:13:17.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-02 23:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lwb8mu","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lwb8mu/rocket_lab_is_going_public_on_a_spac_at_a_41/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lwb8mu/rocket_lab_is_going_public_on_a_spac_at_a_41/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"thefoodboylover","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/thefoodboylover","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"thefoodboylover","score":391,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"火箭实验室将以41亿美元的估值在SPAC上市，并发布了一款新的火箭。","the_new_excerpt":"火箭实验室（Rocket Lab）是一家运载火箭和小型卫星的开发商，将与一家。\n特殊目的采购公司，以支持开发一个更大的采购项目。\n运载火箭，是最新一波太空公司上市交易的一部分。\n\nSPAC交易对Rocket Lab的估值为41亿美元，预计...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"火箭實驗室將以41億美元的估值在SPAC上市，併發布了一款新的火箭。","the_new_excerpt":"火箭實驗室（Rocket Lab）是一家運載火箭和小型衛星的開發商，將與一家。\n特殊目的採購公司，以支持開發一個更大的採購項目。\n運載火箭，是最新一波太空公司上市交易的一部分。\n\nSPAC交易對Rocket Lab的估值爲41億美元，預計...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m3t1jp","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3t1jp/fuck_it_why_not/","title":"Fuck it why not 🦍🦍🌙🌙","date":"March 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"他妈的，为什么不🦍🦍🌙","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"他媽的，爲什麼不🦍🦍🌙","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26444444","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26444444","title":"Gordon Hall has died","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 13, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"戈登-霍尔去世了","locale":"zh"},{"title":"戈登-霍爾去世了","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lwb8mu","previousId":"RedditPost-m3t1jp","nextId":"HnPost-26444444","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lwb8mu/rocket_lab_is_going_public_on_a_spac_at_a_41/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
