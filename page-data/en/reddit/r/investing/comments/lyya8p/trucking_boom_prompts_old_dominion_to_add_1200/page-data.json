The plans include hiring 275 linehaul drivers, 260 pickup and delivery drivers and 100 team drivers. It will also add more than 430 workers on its docks over the same time period.</p>\n\n<p>Average pay for new linehaul drivers will be $99,000, with pickup and delivery drivers earning $73,000 annually. The full-time, nonunion positions also offer health insurance, 401(k) and paid vacation. Old Dominion will pay a $5,000 signing bonus for qualified drivers in certain locations.\n“Our OD people are the heart of our operations and we’re looking to add to our workforce in response to a growing demand for our premium service,” said Marty Freeman, EVP and COO at Old Dominion. “There’s never been a better time to consider a career in transportation. These career opportunities offer a great work-life balance, a competitive compensation package, on-the-job training and career advancement opportunity.”</p>\n\n<p>Old Dominion’s announcement comes as the carrier is executing a terminal expansion plan, which produced nine new or expanded facilities in 2020. Similar additions are planned for 2021. The facility expansion is part of the company’s efforts to increase market share in a favorable trucking environment.</p>\n\n<p>On Tuesday, the carrier announced that year-over-year trends in February (revenue +9.2%) slowed from more robust growth seen in January (revenue +14.6%). Severe winter storms were noted as the reason for the deceleration in the growth rate. Even with the slowdown, the carrier fared better than others in the month.\nSaia (NASDAQ: SAIA) reported a 2.3% year-over-year decline in February tonnage after posting a 5.4% increase in January. The company said roughly 70 terminals were fully or partially offline for several days during the month.\nArcBest Corp. (NASDAQ: ARCB) reported flat tonnage through the first two months of the year in its asset-based segment as February wiped out a 6.6% year-over-year increase to start the year.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/trucking-boom-prompts-old-dominion-to-add-1200-drivers-and-dockworkers\">https://www.freightwaves.com/news/trucking-boom-prompts-old-dominion-to-add-1200-drivers-and-dockworkers</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lyya8p/trucking_boom_prompts_old_dominion_to_add_1200/","title":"Trucking boom prompts Old Dominion to add 1,200 drivers and dockworkers","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-06T16:47:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-06 16:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lyya8p","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lyya8p/trucking_boom_prompts_old_dominion_to_add_1200/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lyya8p/trucking_boom_prompts_old_dominion_to_add_1200/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"thinkB4WeSpeak","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/thinkB4WeSpeak","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"thinkB4WeSpeak","score":163,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"卡车运输的繁荣促使Old Dominion增加1200名司机和码头工人。","the_new_excerpt":"以 \"经济强劲复苏，货运需求旺盛 \"为由。\n货运公司Old Dominion Freight Line（纳斯达克股票代码：ODFL）宣布，将在今年年底前完成其在中国的业务。\n周四计划增加800名司机和400多名码头工人和文员。\n人员。\n\n这家总部位于北卡罗来纳州托马斯维尔的公司表示，它正在寻找... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"卡車運輸的繁榮促使Old Dominion增加1200名司機和碼頭工人。","the_new_excerpt":"以 \"經濟強勁復甦，貨運需求旺盛 \"爲由。\n貨運公司Old Dominion Freight Line（納斯達克股票代碼：ODFL）宣佈，將在今年年底前完成其在中國的業務。\n週四計劃增加800名司機和400多名碼頭工人和文員。\n人員。\n\n這家總部位於北卡羅來納州托馬斯維爾的公司表示，它正在尋找... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m77upx","excerpt":"Came across this and thought this may set a wide reaching precedence across many\nmarkets.\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-46\n\nWashington D.C., March 15, 2021 —\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges and an\nasset freeze and other emergency relief against an…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m77upx/sec_obtains_emergency_asset_freeze_charges/","title":"SEC Obtains Emergency Asset Freeze, Charges California Trader with Posting False Stock Tweets","date":"March 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"美国证券交易委员会获得紧急资产冻结，指控加州交易员发布虚假股票推文。","the_new_excerpt":"偶然间看到这个消息，觉得这可能会在很多方面开创一个广泛的先例。\n市场。\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-46\n\n2021年3月15日，华盛顿特区------。\n\n证券交易委员会今天宣布了欺诈指控和一项\n冻结资产和其他紧急救济，对一...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國證券交易委員會獲得緊急資產凍結，指控加州交易員發佈虛假股票推文。","the_new_excerpt":"偶然間看到這個消息，覺得這可能會在很多方面開創一個廣泛的先例。\n市場。\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-46\n\n2021年3月15日，華盛頓特區------。\n\n證券交易委員會今天宣佈了欺詐指控和一項\n凍結資產和其他緊急救濟，對一...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26496887","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26496887","title":"Audacity 3.0","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 17, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Audacity 3.0","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Audacity 3.0","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lyya8p","previousId":"RedditPost-m77upx","nextId":"HnPost-26496887","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lyya8p/trucking_boom_prompts_old_dominion_to_add_1200/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
