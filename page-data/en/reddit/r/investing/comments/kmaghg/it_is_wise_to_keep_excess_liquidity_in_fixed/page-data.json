Recently I’ve been thinking if it is wiser to keep money in fixed income assets instead but I’m also not very well versed in the topic. REITs are also subject to market forces and so are dividend ETFs. I think that mostly leaves me with bonds, but governments bonds have returns that are too low and corporate bonds can be quite risky, but then again I’m open to all new ideas (maybe AAA bonds?). Nor will I even know how to go about purchasing them (maybe some vanguard etfs)? I’m looking for some guidance, whether it’s links, general advise, your personal experience etc</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kmaghg/it_is_wise_to_keep_excess_liquidity_in_fixed/","title":"It is wise to keep excess liquidity in Fixed income assets rather than cash?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 29, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-29T22:30:22.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-29 22:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kmaghg","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kmaghg/it_is_wise_to_keep_excess_liquidity_in_fixed/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kmaghg/it_is_wise_to_keep_excess_liquidity_in_fixed/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ses92","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ses92","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ses92","score":45,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"将过剩的流动性放在固定收益资产而不是现金中是明智的吗？","the_new_excerpt":"和今年其他很多人一样，我的账户和策略都很有进取心，\n也意味着我保留了相当多的现金(40%-50%)，以示抗议，以防突然\n在市场低迷的情况下，让我自己在突然调整的情况下有灵活性。\n最近我一直在想，把钱放在固定的…里是不是更明智","locale":"zh"},{"title":"將過剩的流動性放在固定收益資產而不是現金中是明智的嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"和今年其他很多人一樣，我的賬戶和策略都很有進取心，\n也意味着我保留了相當多的現金(40%-50%)，以示抗議，以防突然\n在市場低迷的情況下，讓我自己在突然調整的情況下有靈活性。\n最近我一直在想，把錢放在固定的…裏是不是更明智","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25570207","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25570207","title":"Apple’s longtime supplier accused of using forced labor in China","date":"December 29, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"苹果的长期供应商被控在中国使用强迫劳动","locale":"zh"},{"title":"蘋果的長期供應商被控在中國使用強迫勞動","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kmjg3d","excerpt":"Activist hedge fund Third Point LLC is pushing Intel Corp to explore strategic\nalternatives, including whether it should remain an integrated device\nmanufacturer, according to a letter it sent to the chipmaker's chairman on\nTuesday that was reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThird Point CEO Daniel Loeb wrote to…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kmjg3d/activist_hedge_fund_is_pushing_intel_corp_to/","title":"Activist hedge fund is pushing Intel Corp to explore strategic alternatives","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"December 29, 2020","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"激进的对冲基金正在推动英特尔公司探索战略替代方案","the_new_excerpt":"维权对冲基金Third Point LLC正在推动英特尔(Intel Corp)探索战略\n替代方案，包括它是否应该保留为集成设备\n制造商，根据它在周四发给这家芯片制造商董事长的一封信\n周二，路透社对此进行了评论。\n\nThird Point首席执行官丹尼尔·勒布致信…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"激進的對沖基金正在推動英特爾公司探索戰略替代方案","the_new_excerpt":"維權對沖基金Third Point LLC正在推動英特爾(Intel Corp)探索戰略\n替代方案，包括它是否應該保留爲集成設備\n製造商，根據它在週四發給這家芯片製造商董事長的一封信\n週二，路透社對此進行了評論。\n\nThird Point首席執行官丹尼爾·勒布致信…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kmaghg","previousId":"HnPost-25570207","nextId":"RedditPost-kmjg3d","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kmaghg/it_is_wise_to_keep_excess_liquidity_in_fixed/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
