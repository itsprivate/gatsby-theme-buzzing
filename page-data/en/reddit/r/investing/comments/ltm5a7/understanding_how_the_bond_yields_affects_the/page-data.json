It works the same as supply and demand, if no one wants bonds then the yield rates go up to entice investors in to get a higher return and vice versa if everyone wants bonds they go down as they have all the investors they need so why pay them more.</p>\n\n<p>We have been in very hot market before this selloff with very low interest 1% rates (bond yield rates and interest rates are similarly correlated also), this has been because the fed has been capping rates and printing like crazy to prop up the economy. So the average bond investor has been thinking why buy bonds when i can have my money in the stock market and get returns of much more then 1% yield. (If adjusted for inflation your actually getting negative returns)</p>\n\n<p>Problem is bonds is government debt which has inflated loads due to stimulus etc and the government needs people to buy these bonds to raise money, they had the worst bond auction not that long ago which meant no one is buying bond at all!! So what happens, the bond yields rose sharply as no one is buying them, to encourage investors in. There are other reasons for investors not buying bonds, such as additional stimulus, this will increase the debt by even more so bond investors are thinking they will get a better deal if they hold off for even longer for yield rates to increase.</p>\n\n<p>So what happens if no one buys bonds, the government steps in and just prints more money and buy these bonds themselves which is creating this inflation scaremongering also.</p>\n\n<p>The bond yield of 1.5% is benchmark apparently, if it rises sharply from that it normally causes a negative effect in the growth markets (double check the 1.5% rate). However the government is committed to keeping rates down, so they can cap the rates and just keep printing money to pay their debts. However one day this will end and rates will rise.</p>\n\n<p>This bond stuff is theoretical thinking, i cant believe everyone is selling their tech &amp; growth stocks to buy bonds atm. i reckon people are just trimming down their positions and being cash heavy which is accelerating this sell off. When markets start selling off also people start moving their money out of hedge funds and asking them to &#39;hedge&#39; against this downturn which in turns causes them to liquidate their positions adding to the red in the markets.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: this is a simple explanation into bonds and the markets, bonds are complicated and there are many different types. But essentially interest rates are from the bond yield curves and if the bond yields go up then interest rates go up too. High interest rates hampers growth potential of high companies as it costs more to borrow money.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ltm5a7/understanding_how_the_bond_yields_affects_the/","title":"Understanding how the bond yields affects the markets","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-27T13:51:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-27 13:51","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ltm5a7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ltm5a7/understanding_how_the_bond_yields_affects_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ltm5a7/understanding_how_the_bond_yields_affects_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Donkeykong333","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Donkeykong333","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Donkeykong333","score":49,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"了解债券收益率如何影响市场？","the_new_excerpt":"让我们从头说起，国债是政府债务，而债券的\n收益率是设定你从债券中获得的回报率，所以如果债券的\n收益率在2%，也就是你每年的收益率。它的工作原理是一样的\n供求关系，如果没人要债券，那么收益率就会上升... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"瞭解債券收益率如何影響市場？","the_new_excerpt":"讓我們從頭說起，國債是政府債務，而債券的\n收益率是設定你從債券中獲得的回報率，所以如果債券的\n收益率在2%，也就是你每年的收益率。它的工作原理是一樣的\n供求關係，如果沒人要債券，那麼收益率就會上升... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m1aqms","excerpt":"Roblox will become public starting March 10th.
