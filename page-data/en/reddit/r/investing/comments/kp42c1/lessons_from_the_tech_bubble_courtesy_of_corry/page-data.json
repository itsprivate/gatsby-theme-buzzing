For reference, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915\">please refer to the Twitter thread here</a> which has some fantastic notes and charts that I did not paste into the transcript below.</p>\n\n<p>Since there have been so many comparisons recently discussing tech froth, I think this is a wonderful share, especially for the majority of people here who were not investors during that time period. Definitely sheds a lot of light on some popular market cliches that misconstrue that period (IE, &quot;you can only recognize a bubble in hindsight&quot;).  I do not know or follow this person, but still thought this was worth sharing as I came across it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lessons:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Lessons From The Tech Bubble:  Last year, I spent my winter holiday reading hundreds of pages of equity research from the 1999/2000 era, to try to understand what it was like investing during the bubble  A few people recently asked me for my takeaways. </p>\n\n<p>Here they are - Every document hereon comes from my former employer Bernstein Research&#39;s internal research archive, which extend back to 1994  Unfortunately, they&#39;re not available to the public (even Bernstein&#39;s client website cuts off at 2003), but happy to give more details if necessary (see twitter thread for graphic documents).</p>\n\n<p><strong>LESSON #1</strong>: Everybody knew it was a bubble  Unfortunately, the quip &quot;it&#39;s not a bubble if everyone says it is&quot; just isn&#39;t true  Investors were comparing the internet sector to tulip mania as early as mid-98. Bernstein held an entire conference on it in June 99! </p>\n\n<p><strong>LESSON #2:</strong> Calling bubbles is easy, making money is hard  In truth, the hard part about the tech bubble wasn&#39;t noticing it. The hard part was timing it  Our equity strategist tried in January 99... he was off by 14 months (and another 30 point gap in value vs growth) </p>\n\n<p><strong>LESSON #3:</strong> Nobody knew the bubble popped until months after it did  Nobody noticed in March 2000 when it finally popped. Our equity strategist (who bet his career on it!) didn&#39;t catch on until June </p>\n\n<p><strong>LESSON #4:</strong> &quot;Tech&quot; bubble was a misnomer... it was really a large cap growth bubble  See the valuation table below, 1 year before the top  Yes, Microsoft traded at 70x earnings. But Coca Cola was 43x. Pfizer was 92x. Every stock here was a disaster over the next 10 years... </p>\n\n<p><strong>LESSON #5:</strong> Most large cap tech stocks in the bubble had real businesses with strong fundamentals  The internet stocks were a sideshow. In 2000, the software sector had a $1 trillion market cap, 20% net margins, 20% annual growth  The problem? It was trading at 16x sales </p>\n\n<p><strong>LESSON #6:</strong> Fundamentals follow price, not vice versa  The bubble popped in Q1 2000. Fundamentals didn&#39;t decelerate until Q4 2000.   It was reflexivity at work. Lower stock prices = less capex spend = less revenue growth = lower stock prices. A vicious cycle </p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the takeaway here?   Be humble.  For bears, it&#39;s easy to call a bubble. Anybody can do that. Timing is the hard part  For bulls, it&#39;s easy to point to the fundamentals. Historical investors weren&#39;t dumb. The hard part is matching fundamentals with price...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kp42c1/lessons_from_the_tech_bubble_courtesy_of_corry/","title":"Lessons From The Tech Bubble - (Courtesy of @corry_wang)","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-02T22:43:04.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-02 22:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kp42c1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kp42c1/lessons_from_the_tech_bubble_courtesy_of_corry/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kp42c1/lessons_from_the_tech_bubble_courtesy_of_corry/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"cbus20122","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/cbus20122","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"cbus20122","score":395,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"技术泡沫的经验教训-(@corry_Wang提供)","the_new_excerpt":"我在推特上看到了这个帖子，我觉得这是一个很棒的观点\n90年代的网络泡沫上有很多东西。有关参考资料，请参阅\n推特帖子在这里[https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915]\n它有一些很棒的注释和图表，我没有粘贴…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"技術泡沫的經驗教訓-(@corry_Wang提供)","the_new_excerpt":"我在推特上看到了這個帖子，我覺得這是一個很棒的觀點\n90年代的網絡泡沫上有很多東西。有關參考資料，請參閱\n推特帖子在這裏[https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915]\n它有一些很棒的註釋和圖表，我沒有粘貼…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25614966","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25614966","title":"Ask HN: Successful one-person online businesses in 2021?","date":"January 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"HN提问：2021年成功的一人在线业务？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"HN提問：2021年成功的一人在線業務？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1345453159305588737","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1345453159305588737","title":"POLICE RAID CANADIAN HOME FOR HAVING ILLEGAL GATHERING OF 6 PEOPLE\nhttps://t.co/FNdDWfTSKL","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 02, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"警方突击搜查加拿大一户人家非法集会6人\nhttps://t.co/FNdDWfTSKL","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"警方突擊搜查加拿大一戶人家非法集會6人\nhttps://t.co/FNdDWfTSKL","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kp42c1","previousId":"HnPost-25614966","nextId":"TweetPost-1345453159305588737","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kp42c1/lessons_from_the_tech_bubble_courtesy_of_corry/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
