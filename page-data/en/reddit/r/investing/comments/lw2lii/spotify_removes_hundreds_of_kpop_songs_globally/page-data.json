Kakao M distributes a large share of Korean popular music, with 37.5 percent of the songs featured on the 2020 Top 400 Yearly Song Chart from Gaon Music Chart under the company.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-56237626\">Also on BBC</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Kakao M claiming it was Spotify removing it:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.soompi.com/article/1456887wpp/kakao-m-releases-statement-explaining-that-spotify-was-the-one-to-end-their-licensing-agreement\">https://www.soompi.com/article/1456887wpp/kakao-m-releases-statement-explaining-that-spotify-was-the-one-to-end-their-licensing-agreement</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] later that same morning, Kakao M countered with its own statement, in which it claimed that Spotify had been the one who chose not to renew their agreement, even after a request on Kakao M’s part.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While this is clearly over compensation, Spotify needs to rectify this asap. From their <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-02-24/from-bts-to-blackpink-the-power-of-k-pop-has-no-bounds/\">own news release</a>, K-pop is a huge part of why people use their service:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Between January 2014 and January 2020, K-pop&#39;s share of listening on Spotify increased by more than 1,800%.</p>\n\n<p>Since Spotify released its first K-Pop flagship playlist, K-Pop Daebak, in 2014 (and then a massive hub dedicated to the genre in 2015), there have been more than 41 billion K-Pop streams on Spotify. From rising artists to international collaborations, there’s something for both new and old K-Pop lovers on the platform.</p>\n\n<p>Top-streamed K-Pop artists on Spotify include BTS, BLACKPINK, EXO, TWICE, and Red Velvet. In 2019, BTS was the first group from Asia to surpass 5 billion streams on Spotify. And, as of February 2020, the boy band reached a new milestone: more than 8 billion streams (8 billion streams!) on the platform.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If a resolution can&#39;t be reached I think Spotify will be in trouble long-term as whatever service picks it up will siphon a significant chunk of users.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lw2lii/spotify_removes_hundreds_of_kpop_songs_globally/","title":"Spotify removes hundreds of K-pop songs globally, unable to reach an agreement with Kakao M","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-02T16:24:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-02 16:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lw2lii","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lw2lii/spotify_removes_hundreds_of_kpop_songs_globally/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lw2lii/spotify_removes_hundreds_of_kpop_songs_globally/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"suckfail","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/suckfail","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"suckfail","score":2632,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Spotify全球删除数百首K-pop歌曲，无法与Kakao M达成协议。","the_new_excerpt":"原文。\n\nhttps://www.nme.com/news/music/hundreds-k-pop-releases-removed-spotify-worldwide-2890528\n\n> 2021年2月1日，Spotify在韩国推出，但做的时候没有音乐\n> 与Kakao M旗下的艺人达成授权协议，包括IU、Zico等。\n> \n>现在，发行的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Spotify全球刪除數百首K-pop歌曲，無法與Kakao M達成協議。","the_new_excerpt":"原文。\n\nhttps://www.nme.com/news/music/hundreds-k-pop-releases-removed-spotify-worldwide-2890528\n\n> 2021年2月1日，Spotify在韓國推出，但做的時候沒有音樂\n> 與Kakao M旗下的藝人達成授權協議，包括IU、Zico等。\n> \n>現在，發行的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m3mhft","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3mhft/when_im_rwallstreetbets_retard_took_me_3_days_to/","title":"When I'm r/wallstreetbets Retard (took me 3 days to edit it, enjoy you beautiful apes)","date":"March 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"当我在r/wallstreetbets Retard的时候（花了我3天时间来编辑，好好享受你们这些美丽的猿人）。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"當我在r/wallstreetbets Retard的時候（花了我3天時間來編輯，好好享受你們這些美麗的猿人）。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m3l6df","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3l6df/a_new_type_of_investor_is_rising/","title":"A new type of investor is rising!","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 12, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"一种新型的投资者正在崛起!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"一種新型的投資者正在崛起!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lw2lii","previousId":"RedditPost-m3mhft","nextId":"RedditPost-m3l6df","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lw2lii/spotify_removes_hundreds_of_kpop_songs_globally/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
