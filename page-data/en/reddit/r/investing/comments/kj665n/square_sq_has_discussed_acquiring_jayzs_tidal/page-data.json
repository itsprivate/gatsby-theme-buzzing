The negotiations may not result in a transaction.</p>\n\n<p>Square declined to comment, while Tidal didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Tidal, which first launched in 2014, has struggled to keep pace with other streaming services, including Spotify Technology SA and Apple Music. Jay-Z’s own music has been a lure for the platform, but he put his songs back on Spotify last year -- raising questions about the health of Tidal. The closely held service hasn’t reported subscriber figures since saying it had 3 million paying customers in 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Dorsey, meanwhile, has ambitions to build Square into a much broader company made up of stand-alone, complementary services. Square’s two core products, Square Seller and Cash App, already operate somewhat separately within Square Inc., each with its own “lead” on the executive team. It’s believed Dorsey, who spent more than four years on the board of Walt Disney Co., imagines Square will similarly own a collection of businesses under one corporate umbrella.</p>\n\n<p>Dorsey was photographed in August in the Hamptons with Jay-Z and his wife, Beyoncé, and then again in December with the power couple and actor Sean Penn on a beach in Hawaii.</p>\n\n<p>Tidal’s owners include nearly two dozen high-profile artists, including Beyoncé, Alicia Keys, Coldplay, Madonna, Rihanna and others, according to its website. The service is available in 53 countries and offers more than 60 million songs and 250,000 videos.</p>\n\n<p>The service has attempted to use its star power to offer experiences that complement its music. That includes a Rihanna runway show in Paris that was streamed for Tidal members, as well as charity concerts by Jay-Z and Beyoncé.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/square-has-discussed-acquiring-jay-z-s-tidal-service-1.1540779\">https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/square-has-discussed-acquiring-jay-z-s-tidal-service-1.1540779</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kj665n/square_sq_has_discussed_acquiring_jayzs_tidal/","title":"Square (SQ) Has Discussed Acquiring Jay-Z’s Tidal Service","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 24, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-24T04:49:45.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-24 04:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kj665n","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kj665n/square_sq_has_discussed_acquiring_jayzs_tidal/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kj665n/square_sq_has_discussed_acquiring_jayzs_tidal/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"peaceouteast","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/peaceouteast","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"peaceouteast","score":141,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Square(SQ)已经讨论了收购Jay-Z的浪潮服务","the_new_excerpt":"技术\n\n新闻通讯社\n\n5500万年前的公司新闻\n\nSquare已经讨论过收购Jay-Z的潮汐服务公司Lucas Shaw和Kurt Wagner，\n彭博新闻社\n\n杰克·多尔西(Jack Dorsey)，彭博社(Bloomberg)\n\n彭博社(Bloomberg)--杰克·多尔西(Jack Dorsey)经营的数字支付公司Square Inc.\n就收购音乐流媒体…进行了谈判","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Square(SQ)已經討論了收購Jay-Z的浪潮服務","the_new_excerpt":"技術\n\n新聞通訊社\n\n5500萬年前的公司新聞\n\nSquare已經討論過收購Jay-Z的潮汐服務公司Lucas Shaw和Kurt Wagner，\n彭博新聞社\n\n傑克·多爾西(Jack Dorsey)，彭博社(Bloomberg)\n\n彭博社(Bloomberg)--傑克·多爾西(Jack Dorsey)經營的數字支付公司Square Inc.\n就收購音樂流媒體…進行了談判","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kixl3x","excerpt":"I put together the below DD for WSB (hence the bullets) and thought I would\nshare here.
