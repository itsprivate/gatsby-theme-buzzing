They then went into how they’ll be replaced and the ~6 billion dollar contract that comes with them. Currently it’s narrowed down to 3 finalists but has been postponed due to COVID-19. The final 3 companies/ partnerships are Workhorse Group ($WKHS), Karsan and Morgan Olson ($KRSOF &amp; no ticker found for Morgan Olson), and Oshkosh and Ford ($OSK &amp; $F respectively.) I wanted to start a discussion on this and get some other peoples views on investment opportunities. Supposedly, a decision is expected to come out soon. </p>\n\n<p>With the big push towards EV vehicles I feel like workhorse has the best shot. Ford and Oshkosh are going with a regular gas engine while the other 2 manufacturers are going EV/ Hybrid. </p>\n\n<p>Not sure if someone has brought this up already if not and I’m sorry if I missed it. </p>\n\n<p>Info:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2020/12/01/postal-service-delays-mail-truck-replacement-contract-again/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2020/12/01/postal-service-delays-mail-truck-replacement-contract-again/amp/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hammerlanelegends.com/news/us-postal-service-to-award-63b-contract-for-new-mail-truck-this-year-see-the-finalists\">https://www.hammerlanelegends.com/news/us-postal-service-to-award-63b-contract-for-new-mail-truck-this-year-see-the-finalists</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/RE5FGyq12ds\">https://youtu.be/RE5FGyq12ds</a> (Donut Media video)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2021/01/wkhs-stock-no-shoo-in-for-usps-contract/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2021/01/wkhs-stock-no-shoo-in-for-usps-contract/amp/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2018/03/05/usps-karsan-hybrid-mail-truck/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2018/03/05/usps-karsan-hybrid-mail-truck/amp/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2018/03/06/oshkosh-ford-usps-mail-truck/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2018/03/06/oshkosh-ford-usps-mail-truck/amp/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lb1fae/postal_service_replacement_vehicles_discussion/","title":"Postal Service Replacement Vehicles- Discussion","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T02:47:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 02:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lb1fae","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lb1fae/postal_service_replacement_vehicles_discussion/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lb1fae/postal_service_replacement_vehicles_discussion/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"jk-phill","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jk-phill","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"jk-phill","score":61,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"邮政服务更换车辆-讨论","the_new_excerpt":"我看到了一个视频，从甜甜圈媒体关于如何过时的当前美国邮政的交付。\n车辆是。然后，他们进入了他们将如何替换和约60亿的\n元的合同，与他们。目前，它的范围缩小到3\n决赛选手，但由于COVID-19的原因被推迟。最后的3...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"郵政服務更換車輛-討論","the_new_excerpt":"我看到了一個視頻，從甜甜圈媒體關於如何過時的當前美國郵政的交付。\n車輛是。然後，他們進入了他們將如何替換和約60億的\n元的合同，與他們。目前，它的範圍縮小到3\n決賽選手，但由於COVID-19的原因被推遲。最後的3...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lh7a2z","excerpt":"This sincerely is a bit distressing because I put a fair bit of money some time\nago (hundreds of dollars each into diff stocks, not thousands or tens of\nthousands like some people on here so easily seem to toss).\n\nThese are companies I've believed in, and have felt they will do great\nlong-term, but…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lh7a2z/some_of_my_midlong_stocks_have_now_become_meme/","title":"Some of my mid-long stocks have now become meme stocks and it's really messing with me...","date":"February 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我的一些中长线股票现在已经变成了追忆股，这真的让我很纠结...","the_new_excerpt":"这真心有点让人苦恼，因为我花了不少钱，花了一些时间\n前（每只股票几百元，而不是几千或几十元）。\n数千人就像这里的一些人如此轻易地似乎折腾）。)\n\n这些公司我都相信，并且觉得他们会做得很好。\n长期以来，但","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的一些中長線股票現在已經變成了追憶股，這真的讓我很糾結...","the_new_excerpt":"這真心有點讓人苦惱，因爲我花了不少錢，花了一些時間\n前（每隻股票幾百元，而不是幾千或幾十元）。\n數千人就像這裏的一些人如此輕易地似乎折騰）。)\n\n這些公司我都相信，並且覺得他們會做得很好。\n長期以來，但","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lh6kgp","excerpt":"Hi!\n\nBy April APHA and TLRY are going to merge, meaning every APHA share will be\nconverted into 0.83 TLRY share.\n\nSo it's my understanding that as long as APHA/TLRY < 0.83, it's worth buying\nAPHA since it's basically discounted TLRY share.\n\nToday APHA/TLRY = 0.45\n\nI read here that the closer we're…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lh6kgp/explanations_on_the_apha_tlry_merger_please/","title":"Explanations on the APHA -
