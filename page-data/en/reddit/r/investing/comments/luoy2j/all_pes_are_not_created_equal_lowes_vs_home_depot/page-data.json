All too often I&#39;ll see comments indicating it isn&#39;t good &quot;value&quot; based on some arbitrary P/E. A company can appear to be more &quot;expensive&quot;, but still generate better returns than a similar company that trades at a lower P/E, but has inferior returns on invested capital (ROIC). </p>\n\n<p>Two companies I&#39;ve been looking at are Home Depot ($HD) and Lowe&#39;s ($LOW). Both are excellent companies and both have handily outperformed the market over the last 10 years. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;startYear=2011&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=1000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=HD&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;symbol2=LOW&amp;allocation2_2=100\">However, between the two of them, $HD outperformed $LOW because of a better ROIC which translated to a higher earnings growth.</a></p>\n\n<p>At the start of 2011, both companies were trading at a trailing P/E of approx 18 and both are currently trading at a trailing P/E of approx 22.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Lowe&#39;s</strong></p>\n\n<p>A $1000, investment in $LOW would be worth $7668. CAGR of 22.18% (very impressive compared to SPY&#39;s 13.6%)</p>\n\n<p>EPS grew from $1.42 to $7.10 in that period at a CAGR of approx 17.5% (the rest of the returns can be attributed to P/E expansion)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Home Depot</strong></p>\n\n<p>A $1000, investment in $HD would be worth $9267. CAGR of 24.48% </p>\n\n<p>EPS grew from $2.01 to $11.57 in that period at a CAGR of approx 19.13% (the rest of the returns can be attributed to P/E expansion)</p>\n\n<p><strong>The same amount invested in HD resulted in a 20% higher total return over a 10 year period.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I want to be clear that a high ROIC isn&#39;t the be-all and end-all of an investment thesis. The price you pay absolutely matters. But when I screen for stocks, I like to find a company with a solid track record of generating high ROIC over a 10-15 year period. A superior ROIC can be considered a company&#39;s &quot;moat&quot; as it seems to have some secret sauce that lets it generate profits more efficiently than its peers. A healthy ROIC is indicative of a company that is capable of growing the top line efficiently and/or commands strong margins (both of which translate to EPS growth).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keep in mind, when looking at a company&#39;s ROIC, you want to measure it with respect to their peers and the company&#39;s cost of capital.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d say my investment strategy is to find high ROIC businesses in sectors I somewhat understand (consumer staples, consumer goods and retail), build a position when the stock is at a price I find appealing and then hold for as long as the company keeps generating high ROICs (however long that may be). There&#39;s a few variations to the formula that calculates a company&#39;s ROIC, but here&#39;s a simple version that works pretty well (assuming you want to calculate it yourself from the financial statements as opposed to looking it up on Morningstar/ValueLine etc)</p>\n\n<p>ROIC = Operating Profit/(Total Assets - Current portion of Debt - Cash)</p>\n\n<p>So for those of you that may be interested in following that investment strategy, here&#39;s my watchlist (some of which I own). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Consumer Staples -</strong> Brown Forman ($BF.A,) Colgate ($CL), Clorox ($CLX), Hershey ($HSY), Coca-Cola ($KO), Altria ($MO), Philip Morris ($PM), Monster Beverage ($MNST), Boston Beer Co ($SAM) and Unilever ($UL).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Consumer Goods -</strong> Apple ($AAPL), Lululemon Athletica ($LULU) and Nike ($NKE).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Retail and Restaurants -</strong> Dominos ($DPZ), Home Depot ($HD), McDonalds ($MCD), O&#39;Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) and Starbucks ($SBUX), Ross Stores ($ROST) and TJX Companies ($TJX).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Financial Services -</strong> Mastercard ($MA) and S&amp;P Global Inc ($SPGI)</p>\n\n<p><strong>There&#39;s no guarantee that such stocks will always outperform or that they can maintain high ROICs indefinitely.</strong> However, it&#39;s a good place to start.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> High ROIC companies generally trade at a premium. This is because they are able to grow earnings faster and/or return more capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/luoy2j/all_pes_are_not_created_equal_lowes_vs_home_depot/","title":"All P/Es are not created equal - Lowe's vs Home Depot","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-01T17:21:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-01 17:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"luoy2j","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/luoy2j/all_pes_are_not_created_equal_lowes_vs_home_depot/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/luoy2j/all_pes_are_not_created_equal_lowes_vs_home_depot/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"vipnasty","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/vipnasty","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"vipnasty","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"所有的市盈率并不一样--Lowe's与家得宝的对比","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/all-pes-are-not-created-equal\n\n这篇文章虽然有点过时，但对初入职场的投资者很有意义。所有\n我经常会看到一些评论，表明它不是很好的 \"价值\"，基于一些。\n任意的市盈率。一个公司...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"所有的市盈率並不一樣--Lowe's與家得寶的對比","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/all-pes-are-not-created-equal\n\n這篇文章雖然有點過時，但對初入職場的投資者很有意義。所有\n我經常會看到一些評論，表明它不是很好的 \"價值\"，基於一些。\n任意的市盈率。一個公司...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26416545","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26416545","title":"Making an online multiplayer game with Godot and Nakama","date":"March 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"用Godot和Nakama制作在线多人游戏。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"用Godot和Nakama製作在線多人遊戲。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m2ve17","excerpt":"At this point: CPI was reported and treasury auctions took place this week\n(there is one more for 30 year bonds today).\n\nIt looks the market changed the narrative.
