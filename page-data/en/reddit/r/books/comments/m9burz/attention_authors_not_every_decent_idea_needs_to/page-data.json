What happened to taking a stand alone story and then subsequently building a universe around it through disparate, but still connected follow up stories?  More story to tell can certainly necessitate a sequel, but when and why did three books become the magic number?  Take a cue from Orson Scott Card and his &#39;Enders&#39; universe.  Or, to a more extreme extent, Stephen King, where novels stand on their own merit but are interwoven and abide by the same in-world rules and history.  I can&#39;t be the only one who will be eager to read a new author, pick up a new release not knowing it was the first in an intended trilogy, and then read the second out of obligation and then be motivated by pure spite/OCD by the third.
