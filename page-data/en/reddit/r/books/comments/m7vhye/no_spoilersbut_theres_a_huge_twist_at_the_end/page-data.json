Many times, I have had well-meaning people suggest a book and comment that there is a big plot surprise at the end....but then hasten to add that they aren&#39;t going to spoil it.  But they DID just spoil it........</p>\n\n<p>A plot twist is obviously most effective when you aren&#39;t expecting it.  If you know the twist is coming, you are constantly on the lookout for it; you are actively speculating what the twist will be.  When it finally comes, there is no real excitement....or even an actual &quot;surprise&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I know that it can be incredibly difficult not to talk about an extraordinary reading experience.  I enjoy hearing people talk about a book that they truly enjoyed.  And I (like most people) enjoy an unpredictable plot.  But please keep the &quot;huge twists&quot; to yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, the reviews and synopsis on the book cover will probably be sufficient to spoil this.  I can&#39;t recall the last time that a plot twist was in any way surprising....and that&#39;s kind of a shame.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m7vhye/no_spoilersbut_theres_a_huge_twist_at_the_end/","title":"No spoilers....but there's a HUGE twist at the end","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-18T18:30:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-18 18:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"960c2055-e43f-5a7b-9800-030f1faa0d0b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m7vhye/no_spoilersbut_theres_a_huge_twist_at_the_end/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m7vhye/no_spoilersbut_theres_a_huge_twist_at_the_end/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"johnstrt","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/johnstrt","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"johnstrt","score":240,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"没有破坏者....，但最后有一个巨大的转折。","the_new_excerpt":"你有过这样的经历吗？很多次，我都有好心的人\n推荐一本书，并评论说最后有一个很大的情节惊喜....，但。\n然后赶紧补充说，他们不打算破坏它。但是，他们确实只是破坏了\n它........\n\n情节转折显然是最有效的，当你不...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"沒有破壞者....，但最後有一個巨大的轉折。","the_new_excerpt":"你有過這樣的經歷嗎？很多次，我都有好心的人\n推薦一本書，並評論說最後有一個很大的情節驚喜....，但。\n然後趕緊補充說，他們不打算破壞它。但是，他們確實只是破壞了\n它........\n\n情節轉折顯然是最有效的，當你不...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-37813885-7924-5e48-88d6-3a36ef39e5e9","excerpt":"I like browsing Goodreads and reading reviews to determine if a book is\nsomething I want to spend money on.
