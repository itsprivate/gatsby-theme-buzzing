It was so well written. I loved that it was narrarated by death in nazi Germany. The characters were so well rounded and all had wonderful arcs. The end was terribly sad but was redeemed by Max and Liezels ending. Which is how I think all books should end if a sad ending is necessary. I would like to hope that the husband they mention in the last chapter is Max. They take care of each other so well. Ugh. I can&#39;t get over this book. Anyway.
