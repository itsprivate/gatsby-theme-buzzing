Shocking? I settled on life-changing because it&#39;s true. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a big reader of fantasy sagas and the Dark Tower was like a two-by-four between the eyes. As I&#39;ve grown older, I&#39;ve feared that I was growing out of fantasy. The last several fantasy novels I&#39;ve read were guilty pleasures, yes, fun, yes, but they left me empty. They didn&#39;t stick with me.</p>\n\n<p>But The Dark Tower reminded me that fantasy is a pretty broad category, and even within that category The Dark Tower is the weird platypus creature of fantasy sagas. It was written over the course of 30 years, and the story reflects the growth of the writer, evolving both narratively and thematically as King grew up, matured, started a family, and struggled with substance abuse. And there&#39;s at least one story swerve caused by other true-life events. It is also, I think, not a story that is supposed to make you feel good about yourself. The protagonist starts out downright unlikeable and evolves into one of the most complex, compelling and ambivalent figures I&#39;ve encountered in fiction. I&#39;m still not sure how I feel about him. I certainly want to have a few words with him about certain choices he made.</p>\n\n<p>That all sounds rather dour, I guess. But there are few books I&#39;ve ever read as <em>fun</em> as these books can be. Not all of them and not all the time, but the heights reached in <em>The Drawing of the Three</em> and <em>Wizard and Glass</em> are nearly unmatched, for my money.</p>\n\n<p>I said life-changing. For me, that means that the books really seriously forced me to confront what&#39;s important in my life, and whether I&#39;m making the choices that line up with that. I use present tense here because this feels ongoing, this feels like these books will be with me for a long time. We all have our own Dark Tower and our own ka-tet, and it&#39;s impossible to just keep plodding on as before after learning the tale of Roland of Gilead.</p>\n\n<p>Say thankya.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mocpxw/the_dark_tower_is_lifechanging/","title":"The Dark Tower is Life-Changing","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"April 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-10T22:09:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-10 22:09","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"8a15bbd5-faa3-51c7-a41f-247d84f8a02f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mocpxw/the_dark_tower_is_lifechanging/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mocpxw/the_dark_tower_is_lifechanging/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"retsim_snrub","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/retsim_snrub","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"retsim_snrub","score":68,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ダークタワー」は人生を変える","the_new_excerpt":"数週間前に完成しました。タイトルにふさわしい形容詞に苦労しました。\nタイトルは Amazing?
