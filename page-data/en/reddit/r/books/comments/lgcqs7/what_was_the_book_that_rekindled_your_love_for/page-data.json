I eventually installed the kindle desktop reader and bought Dante&#39;s Inferno. Would often have 10-20 minutes in between calls and realized the time flew by when I was absorbed in literature. You couldn&#39;t have phones on the floor and our internet access was pretty limited, but reading made an 8 hour shift fly by. I&#39;d get a call and I just couldn&#39;t wait to transport back into whatever world I was immersed in.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to that, I had spent probably 5 years without reading for pleasure. I recall vividly an overwhelming sense of joy when I realized what my life had been missing - and the fulfillment that books were likely going to bring me.</p>\n\n<p>Anyhow, just curious as to what book lead you back into the world of reading for pleasure. Looking forward to your replies :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lgcqs7/what_was_the_book_that_rekindled_your_love_for/","title":"What was the book that rekindled your love for reading?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T06:58:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 06:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"17985158-a97b-5f89-b4ec-969644e6909a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lgcqs7/what_was_the_book_that_rekindled_your_love_for/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lgcqs7/what_was_the_book_that_rekindled_your_love_for/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"joebrown75","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/joebrown75","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"joebrown75","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"是什么书重新点燃了你对阅读的热爱？","the_new_excerpt":"对我来说，奇怪的是，那是但丁的《地狱》。\n\n我有一份愚蠢的呼叫中心工作，晚上有很多休息时间。I\n最终安装了kindle桌面阅读器，买了但丁的《地狱》。会\n经常有10-20分钟的通话间隔，当我意识到时间飞快地流逝时，我\n被吸收在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"是什麼書重新點燃了你對閱讀的熱愛？","the_new_excerpt":"對我來說，奇怪的是，那是但丁的《地獄》。\n\n我有一份愚蠢的呼叫中心工作，晚上有很多休息時間。I\n最終安裝了kindle桌面閱讀器，買了但丁的《地獄》。會\n經常有10-20分鐘的通話間隔，當我意識到時間飛快地流逝時，我\n被吸收在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-9c0ad147-a933-5454-9526-0de8b5e545aa","excerpt":"This is a book I have planned to read since I was young, I am now twenty three\nand damn was this an emotional rollercoaster...
