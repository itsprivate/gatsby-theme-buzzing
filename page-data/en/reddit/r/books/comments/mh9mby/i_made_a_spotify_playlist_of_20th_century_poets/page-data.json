Cummings, T.S. Eliot, William Butler Yeats, Langston Hughes and more. The recordings include a mix of excerpts of novels and poetry.</p>\n\n<p>Last year I discovered some albums of 20th century writers reciting their work and eventually I came across these albums. I recently realized that there were a huge volume of these Soundmark recordings, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be anywhere to find them all in one place, so I searched for as many as I could find and compiled them into this playlist. (I&#39;m not sure how many I may be missing, so if you know of any albums I should add, feel free to comment them here or send me a message and I&#39;ll add it!)</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been really enjoying listening to these writers reading their own words, and I find it&#39;s interesting to hear their different accents and inflections and how lyrically or flatly they individually speak. It&#39;s like discovering another dimension to the written work, since you&#39;re not only experiencing the words of the author but you&#39;re actually hearing the words spoken in their own voice with all their own unique inflections and articulations. I would be interested to know what all your thoughts are on this, and whether you think it adds or takes away from the experience of these texts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>LINK: It looks like the link keeps getting auto removed, so you&#39;ll have to search for the title on Spotify.</strong> You can search for the title below, or look at my post history for the recent post in <a href=\"/r/poetry\">r/poetry</a> which includes the link!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Soundmark Records - Authors &amp; Poets, The Complete Collection</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sorry for this!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mh9mby/i_made_a_spotify_playlist_of_20th_century_poets/","title":"I made a Spotify playlist of 20th century poets reading their writings.
