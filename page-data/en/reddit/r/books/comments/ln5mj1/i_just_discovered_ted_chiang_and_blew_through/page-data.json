And I was not disappointed. I loved &quot;Story of Your Life&quot; even more than the movie; I felt I learned so much about language and communication, but it also explored heavy themes like love, grief, destiny, and free will. I really, really, really loved it.</p>\n\n<p>My other favorite stories would have to be &quot;Liking What You See: A Documentary&quot; (a Black Mirror-esque story about tech that blocks people from recognizing the physical attractiveness of other people) and &quot;Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom&quot; (a story that explores how glimpes of parallel universes and our parallel selves would affect how we act in our own world). </p>\n\n<p>The word &quot;thought-provoking&quot; gets thrown around a lot by critics but it really is the best way to describe Chiang&#39;s stories. They make you literally stop and think.  I am so glad I discovered his work and I can&#39;t wait for him to release another short story collection.</p>\n\n<p>Special mentions to round out my top 5:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>&quot;The Life Cycle of Software Objects&quot;</p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;Division By Zero&quot;</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ln5mj1/i_just_discovered_ted_chiang_and_blew_through/","title":"I just discovered Ted Chiang and blew through every single one of his short stories in a week.
