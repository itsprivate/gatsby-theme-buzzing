I rarely have time to just sit down and read an actual book, but I have tons of downtime while commuting to work and things like that which would be perfect for an audiobook.  A few years back I decided to give one a try.  </p>\n\n<p>I decided that for my first audiobook I wanted to listen to something I was already familiar with so I didn&#39;t have to dedicate as much concentration to it since I would know the storyline, characters, etc.  I decided to go with Harry Potter.  It was one of the best decisions I&#39;ve ever made.   I listened to the books while driving to and from work (or driving anywhere for that matter), while going for a walk at lunch, while walking the dog in the evening, while mowing the lawn, and probably during some other times.  I flew through the first book and then finished off the entire series.</p>\n\n<p>Since then I&#39;ve listened to dozens of books that I never would have actually read if I only had access to ebooks or physical books.  I&#39;m sure audiobooks aren&#39;t for everyone, but I recommend anyone who wants to read more, but doesn&#39;t have time to just sit down and read, give them a shot and listen during those times where you can do two things at once.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the series I&#39;ve listened to are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Harry Potter</li>\n<li>Chronicles of Narnia</li>\n<li>Wheel of Time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re not familiar with Overdrive and Libby, check them our for free audiobooks from your library system.</p>\n\n<p>Good Luck!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/loa6rm/if_you_havent_tried_an_audiobook_give_it_a_go/","title":"If you haven't tried an Audiobook, give it a go.
