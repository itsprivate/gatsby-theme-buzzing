I hopped an Amtrak train and settled in to read. I tend to re-read my favorites often. One of my top favorite authors is a bit obscure but a staple of NYC culture. He writes fiction loosely based on some of his experiences based upon growing up in the city. As the train rattled south, I started to contemplate stopping at New York City for a few hours to get lunch and site see. </p>\n\n<p>I looked down at my book and thought how neat it would be to run into my author. Then my wheels turned. I picked up my phone and started searching for a public profile on social media. I finally found one, sent him a message about being a fan and if he was out and about if he would sign my book. It was a wild shot in the dark, and I figure it would go unanswered.</p>\n\n<p>Two hours later, we pulled into Penn Station and I got off to go grab some lunch and maybe shop when my phone dinged. It was him. </p>\n\n<p>He had written me back and agreed to sign my book. I couldn’t believe it. I said I’d meet him at a famous book store called the Strand  in the East Village to make it easy on him. I quickly hopped a cab to the book store and waited like a nervous teenager. Anyone that is a book nerd must go to the Strand once in their life. </p>\n\n<p>I recognized him immediately as he approached me. He asked if I wanted to get a burger and chat and he would happily sign it. Absolutely! </p>\n\n<p>We walked to a burger place, all while stopping to show me places that were important in his books, or that held significance. We ate and chatted. We walked for a few hours afterwards as he graciously gave me a tour detailing the visions of his books until it started to rain. We popped into a pizza shop- he graciously signed my books, gave me his shirt, took a picture with me and got me in a cab back to Penn Station before the last train. </p>\n\n<p>The lesson of the day was wonderful- I learned as much as I appreciated his writings, he appreciated how much I valued wanting to truly hear the origins and birth of it all. I promised to return to NY this year and return his shirt- and in his latest book released last year- my name is included in the forward thank you list of people — as a thank you for the burger.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mp08aw/lessons_learned_by_taking_a_chance_a_burger_and/","title":"Lessons learned by taking a chance: a burger and stroll with my favorite author","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"April 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-12T03:41:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-12 03:41","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"9fa8e13e-9d39-506f-a06b-0edad3e6d956","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mp08aw/lessons_learned_by_taking_a_chance_a_burger_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mp08aw/lessons_learned_by_taking_a_chance_a_burger_and/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/-JNIlsm7c_pV6s4ukTpK_MLU0HxJ1MjyvUo4nhZ9iGg.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6032c7f26850b1dea7cb1634ee1bc2dffd82c68f","video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"jamiegirl21","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jamiegirl21","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"jamiegirl21","score":65,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"チャンスを掴むことで得られる教訓：大好きな作家とのハンバーガーと散歩","the_new_excerpt":"https://imgur.com/gallery/7cREfyk\n\n私は、本を愛する仲間のために、ちょっと変わった話をしたいと思いました。\n私が学んだことは、とても貴重な「感謝」でした。\n\n年前、私は仕事でボストンに行っていました（看護師で、会議に参加していました）。\nある日の早朝、ボストンを出発して南に向かっていました。その時、私が乗っていたのは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"碰运气的经验：与我最喜欢的作家一起吃汉堡和散步。","the_new_excerpt":"https://imgur.com/gallery/7cREfyk\n\n我想给书友们分享一个奇特的故事，因为这堂课我\n学到的是如此宝贵--欣赏。\n\n两年前--我在一次工作中（我是一名护士，正在参加一个会议），在。\n波士顿和离开 一个清晨向南走。我跳了一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"碰運氣的經驗：與我最喜歡的作家一起喫漢堡和散步。","the_new_excerpt":"https://imgur.com/gallery/7cREfyk\n\n我想給書友們分享一個奇特的故事，因爲這堂課我\n學到的是如此寶貴--欣賞。\n\n兩年前--我在一次工作中（我是一名護士，正在參加一個會議），在。\n波士頓和離開 一個清晨向南走。我跳了一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-c1038377-aa18-5023-850e-8423f55879d6","excerpt":"The Giver is not a dystopian novel warning us against the encroaching forces of\ntyranny seeking to enforce upon us a \"sameness\" sanitizing our lives from the\ngrit and difficulty that make up our existence.
