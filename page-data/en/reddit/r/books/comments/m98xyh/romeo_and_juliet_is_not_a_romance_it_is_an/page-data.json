Like, their <em>unnamed</em> grudge causes fights to break out in the streets, causes deaths of people who have nothing to do with their grudge. You could make the argument that the fact that no one can name what caused this animosity, that it must not have even been so terrible, and they are holding onto it all out of pride.</p>\n\n<p>Romeo is introduced to us by saying how he wants to <em>kill himself</em> because his romance with Rosaline ended, then immediately falls in love with the first cute chick he sees that same night, implying that he falls in love easily- that he is more in love with being in love than anything else. This is further exemplified by the fact that, unlike with many of Shakespeare&#39;s couples in other plays, we really don&#39;t get a chance to see either Romeo and Juliet as individuals with their own personalities other than &quot;in love&quot;. Romeo, what about Juliet do you love so much other than her appearance? Anything? Wit? Kindness? Determination? What, other than appearance, makes her worthy of your obsession? He never takes the time to praise anything other than her surface qualities.</p>\n\n<p>Romeo allows his obsession to shut down any thought of the potential consequences in eloping with Juliet. This is seen by how cluelessly he responds to Tybalt on encountering him, post marriage. He doesn&#39;t even behave rationally, just thinking: Well, I love Juliet and she loves you, therefore we&#39;re buds now.</p>\n\n<p>As for Tybalt, his failure is giving in to blind rage, provoking a fight between himself and Romeo, which results in Tybalt&#39;s death.</p>\n\n<p>Mercutio is pissed cuz he knew all of this needless fighting and death was based on these two families being made up of absolute drama queens all worked up over some straight-up bullshit and that <em>none of this had to be this way,</em> but because Romeo is his himbo friend he goes ahead and gets murked trying to keep his buddy from killing himself. This is why he dies like: &quot;For the record, you guys&#39; families are toxic af. Bleeehhhhh...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if Romeo had given a moment to think about <em>anything at all</em> in the crypt (self-reflection, analyzing the damage this family grudge has done to everyone, commentary on the crypt&#39;s interior decor) rather than <em>immediately making decisions based on his powerful emotions</em> neither Romeo nor Juliet would have died.</p>\n\n<p>Stop teaching Romeo and Juliet as a romance. Especially to teens. Teens are <em>often</em> influenced by their emotions into making knee-jerk decisions that they often come to regret or have dangerous consequences. They <em>need</em> to hear the allegory as it was intended to be taken.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit: no, I didn&#39;t <em>just</em> realize this. I am frustrated because as a librarian that works with teens, I have heard this is how it&#39;s being taught to them, and when I was in high school I was also taught to interpret it as a sad love story about true love. I am frustrated to hear that it is still being taught this way by at least some teachers.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m98xyh/romeo_and_juliet_is_not_a_romance_it_is_an/","title":"Romeo and Juliet is NOT a romance, it is an allegory about the dangers of making big decisions based on emotion alone","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-20T16:34:44.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-20 16:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b2a64c74-0d97-5500-9cbe-44e40f35f3f5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m98xyh/romeo_and_juliet_is_not_a_romance_it_is_an/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m98xyh/romeo_and_juliet_is_not_a_romance_it_is_an/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Cucubert","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cucubert","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Cucubert","score":258,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"罗密欧与朱丽叶》不是一部爱情片，它是一部关于仅凭情感做出重大决定的危险的寓言。","the_new_excerpt":"这不是一个关于真爱的悲剧性爱情故事，而是一个警告，不要让自己成为这样的人\n仅仅被自己的情绪所统治。\n\n父母被怨恨所统治，阻止了子女的幸福和\n在他们生活的小镇上造成暴力和死亡，因为他们都不想。\n原谅对方。比如，他们的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"羅密歐與朱麗葉》不是一部愛情片，它是一部關於僅憑情感做出重大決定的危險的寓言。","the_new_excerpt":"這不是一個關於真愛的悲劇性愛情故事，而是一個警告，不要讓自己成爲這樣的人\n僅僅被自己的情緒所統治。\n\n父母被怨恨所統治，阻止了子女的幸福和\n在他們生活的小鎮上造成暴力和死亡，因爲他們都不想。\n原諒對方。比如，他們的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-683c54c1-9431-5396-8770-00ee081ad2f1","excerpt":"now, my book taste is very broad, so i guess i should have expected to find so\nmany damn books to read, but WOW, it's insane when you start to think about it.\ni was proud of how many books ive read but in reality i haven't even touched the\nsurface of the genres i enjoy.\n\ni went through…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m9236y/there_are_so_many_books/","title":"there. are. so. many. books.","date":"March 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"有...很多...书。","the_new_excerpt":"现在，我的书的口味是非常广泛的，所以我想我应该有预期的发现，所以。\n很多该死的书读，但哇，这是疯狂的，当你开始思考它。\n我为自己读了多少书而感到自豪，但实际上，我甚至还没有接触过的\n我喜欢的类型的表面。\n\n我经历了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有...很多...書。","the_new_excerpt":"現在，我的書的口味是非常廣泛的，所以我想我應該有預期的發現，所以。\n很多該死的書讀，但哇，這是瘋狂的，當你開始思考它。\n我爲自己讀了多少書而感到自豪，但實際上，我甚至還沒有接觸過的\n我喜歡的類型的表面。\n\n我經歷了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-99749c1b-2ccc-5f2b-88d1-b155ad0100c7","excerpt":"I read through The Godfather and boy was this book fantastic.
