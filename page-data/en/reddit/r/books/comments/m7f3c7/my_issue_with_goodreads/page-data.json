The suggestions given by the algorithm are sometimes head scratching, but my reading interests are sort of all over the place so it makes sense. What really bothers me is that Goodreads allows people to review a book before it&#39;s even released.</p>\n\n<p>I love fantasy books, and classics, and a solid work of literary fiction...but I also love a good, slow burn romance. Sometimes a girl just needs to sit down with a book that we know had a happy ending and I&#39;m not even a little embarrassed about it. One of my favorite romance authors is Mariana Zapata, her books aren&#39;t insta-love and have characters with depth and emotion and the romance is real. Mariana announced her new book is in the final stages of editing, so I headed on over to Goodreads to add it to my &quot;Want to Read&quot; pile. The book hasn&#39;t been released yet and is already receiving a 93% 5-star rating consisting mostly of random gifs and &quot;omg omg&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Why Goodreads? WHY? Just create some code that no one can review a book until it&#39;s been released for 24-hours or something to help keep reviews accurate for those of us who rely on them.</p>\n\n<p>Also, to any of you who do this, freaking stop! Take your fangirl/boy-ing to the authors Facebook group or somewhere else more appropriate, let&#39;s keep the review section for reviews.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m7f3c7/my_issue_with_goodreads/","title":"My Issue with Goodreads","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-18T18:01:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-18 18:01","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"145e03cb-f193-588f-9c66-cc6d2059a722","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m7f3c7/my_issue_with_goodreads/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m7f3c7/my_issue_with_goodreads/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"okjersey","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/okjersey","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"okjersey","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我与Goodreads的问题","the_new_excerpt":"我喜欢浏览Goodreads和阅读评论，以确定一本书是否是。\n我想花钱的东西。该算法给出的建议是\n有时会头疼，但我的阅读兴趣算是很广泛的。\n的地方，所以它是有意义的。真正困扰我的是，Goodreads允许... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我與Goodreads的問題","the_new_excerpt":"我喜歡瀏覽Goodreads和閱讀評論，以確定一本書是否是。\n我想花錢的東西。該算法給出的建議是\n有時會頭疼，但我的閱讀興趣算是很廣泛的。\n的地方，所以它是有意義的。真正困擾我的是，Goodreads允許... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-39fe3411-b8c6-5e6a-8ab8-9bd95f0b60d7","excerpt":"I’m reading Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn right now and was thoroughly enjoying\nmyself until halfway through when it suddenly became some weird high school fan\nfiction. “I think you’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, I had to go\nhome early from work for not concentrating.” Maybe I’m…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m7t18b/sex_scenes_especially_the_dialogue_during_them/","title":"Sex scenes (especially the dialogue during them) and corny romance ruin books for me.","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"性爱场面（尤其是其中的对话）和老套的爱情故事毁了我的书。","the_new_excerpt":"我现在正在读吉利安-弗林的《尖锐物体》，非常喜欢。\n我自己直到半途而废的时候，突然变成了一些奇怪的高中生粉丝。\n的小说。\"我觉得你是我见过的最漂亮的女人，我不得不去。\n下班早回家，因为不专心。\" 也许我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"性愛場面（尤其是其中的對話）和老套的愛情故事毀了我的書。","the_new_excerpt":"我現在正在讀吉利安-弗林的《尖銳物體》，非常喜歡。\n我自己直到半途而廢的時候，突然變成了一些奇怪的高中生粉絲。\n的小說。\"我覺得你是我見過的最漂亮的女人，我不得不去。\n下班早回家，因爲不專心。\" 也許我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ea0b1f29-255c-541d-ab72-f9a199189d21","excerpt":"Has this ever happened to you?
