I grew up in India, and English was not my first language, and I didn&#39;t even hear about him until my late 20&#39;s. I have always been a horror lover but in many forums, I have always heard that King&#39;s books are for teenagers and basically not great. So I put off reading his books. I did then picked up one of his books, called Duma Key, and that did not suit my style at all. So I thought he is not my author then. But then, great horror is hard to come by, and I saw a suggestion of Pet Semetary here. So I gave him a second chance with that book.</p>\n\n<p>And wow, Pet Semetary has become one of my most favorite books of all time. More than the ghost part, I am bowled over by how well he deals with the feelings surrounding death. <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">The grief of the parents and the constant premonition of &#39;sometimes dead IS better&#39; was so well done! </span></p>\n\n<p>Then I read Salem&#39;s Lot and now reading  IT. I have watched the movie, but the book is so much more. <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">The part where Bill is struggling with his brothers&#39; death and describes the cold space between his parents just hits hard. A 10-year-old grieving for his 6-year-old dead brother becomes such an intimate scene for the reader! </span> He is my favorite horror author now. He may not have the best prose or a beautiful flowery writing style, but his direct and intimate writing style works for horror very well.</p>\n\n<p>I just want to say to this group that thank you for suggesting Pet Semetary. If there are any older readers hesitating to start reading King, my advice is that there&#39;s a lot to love in his books even if you are grown up now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mex78g/discovering_stephen_king_late_in_life_30s_and_he/","title":"Discovering Stephen King late in life (30's) and he is quickly becoming a favorite author.
