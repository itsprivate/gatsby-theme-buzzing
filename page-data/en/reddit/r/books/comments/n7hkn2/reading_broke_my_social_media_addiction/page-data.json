Five years ago, I deleted Facebook and suffered withdrawal. Reddit became my new social media addiction. Mainly because there&#39;s more to read (go figure!)</p>\n\n<p>A few months ago, I decided to cut down my time reading on Reddit, and get back to reading books instead. </p>\n\n<p>The first thing I did was purchase a Kindle. Living in a small town, I use Amazon a lot and I have a Prime membership. It only made sense to buy a Kindle. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s become a habit to come home from work, shower, and scroll with Reddit to unwind so I can fall asleep. Well, I did an experiment. </p>\n\n<p>I moved my phone and charger further away from my bed and placed my Kindle where my phone and charger used to be - and I&#39;ve set a daily reminder in Google calendar to read every day. </p>\n\n<p>I read the entire Wizard of Oz series and I am now on the third book of a trilogy. (Kushiel&#39;s Avatar is the book I&#39;m on now) </p>\n\n<p>My mental health has immensely improved. And I&#39;m saving a lot of money and space in my house! I even carry my kindle with me to work. I read on my lunch break. I read during my downtime. I read when I get off work. I take a shower, curl up in bed, read until I get sleepy, slide it under my pillow and go to sleep.</p>\n\n<p>I make sure to place it in my work bag before I leave for work. I&#39;m getting quality sleep. My overall mood has improved. I have a new appreciation for books and reading in general. Rediscovering a passion I had from when I was a kid. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not one of those people that scream, &quot;Social media is bad for you!&quot; because it depends on how it&#39;s used. By joining this sub, and reading about all the books everyone else is reading gave a me FOMO feeling. </p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t have much to contribute or talk about because, well, I wasn&#39;t reading! I took action to change that and now I reach for my Kindle instead of my phone. I&#39;m genuinely excited about my results and I had to share. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know if anyone else struggles with social media addiction but if you do and you love to read, get an e-reader and reach for that instead of your phone. You won&#39;t regret it - I promise! </p>\n\n<p>And special thanks to this sub for all the wonderful discussions and great titles. Honestly, the books on my wishlist (from this sub) is larger than my wallet, haha!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/n7hkn2/reading_broke_my_social_media_addiction/","title":"Reading Broke My Social Media Addiction","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"May 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-08T07:33:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-08 07:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"f0d29768-5e8c-5934-8c96-e382c7a54a52","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/n7hkn2/reading_broke_my_social_media_addiction/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/n7hkn2/reading_broke_my_social_media_addiction/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"xLadyPhoenix74x","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/xLadyPhoenix74x","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"xLadyPhoenix74x","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"読書が私のソーシャルメディア依存症を解消してくれた","the_new_excerpt":"私はソーシャルメディア依存症でした。5年前、私はFacebookを削除し、禁断症状に苦しみました。\n禁断症状が出ました。Redditは私の新しいソーシャルメディア中毒になりました。主な理由は、読むものが\n読むものが多いからです（笑）。\n\n数ヶ月前、私はRedditで読む時間を減らして、代わりに本を読むことにしました。\n代わりに本を読むことにした。\n\n最初の...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"阅读打破了我的社交媒体之瘾","the_new_excerpt":"我曾是一个社交媒体上瘾者。五年前，我删除了Facebook并遭受了\n戒断。Reddit成为我新的社交媒体瘾。主要是因为这里有\n更多的阅读（去想！）。\n\n几个月前，我决定减少我在Reddit上的阅读时间，并重新回到\n重新阅读书籍。\n\n第一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"閱讀打破了我的社交媒體之癮","the_new_excerpt":"我曾是一個社交媒體上癮者。五年前，我刪除了Facebook並遭受了\n戒斷。Reddit成爲我新的社交媒體癮。主要是因爲這裏有\n更多的閱讀（去想！）。\n\n幾個月前，我決定減少我在Reddit上的閱讀時間，並重新回到\n重新閱讀書籍。\n\n第一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-95977878-d696-5fb9-b82e-fa7374f94128","excerpt":"This is not asking about the fav lists, or most recent reads, but mainly books\nyou think everyone should read.
