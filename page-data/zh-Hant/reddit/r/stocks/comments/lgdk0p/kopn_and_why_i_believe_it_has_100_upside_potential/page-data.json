I don&#39;t have time to do a full DD but here are some thoughts:</p>\n\n<p><strong>KOPN (Kopin Corporation)</strong> is best known for its display devices for mobile electronics. The company was founded by engineers from MIT and currently holds hundreds of patents that are applicable to <strong>Augmented Reality</strong>. Some of the most promising patents involve wearable technology and voice recognition-based headsets. </p>\n\n<p>In the past several years, Kopin has contracted with the U.S. Department of Defense to research wearable head-mounted computers for soldiers. They have supplied defense technology for several defense companies including Rockwell Collins, Raytheon, and BAE. But defense is just a fractional part of Kopin&#39;s growth potential. </p>\n\n<p><strong>I believe that Kopin is set to be a breakout company in the Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) sectors.</strong> Kopin&#39;s VR technology is already a market leader. Their OLED microdisplays have the highest frame rates and resolution rates with the smallest sizes and lowest power consumption. They also have a voice-activated microchip technology called Whisper, which they claim is 200% better than other voice-recognition chips in the market. Cathie Woods recently talked about AR/VR in her 2021 Big Ideas presentation, which I think is another solid sign for KOPN.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I also believe that Kopin will partner with Apple.</strong> Kopin has worked with Google Glass and Microsoft. Based on Patent filings, Apple has been exploring AR/VR for at least ten years. In January 2021, Dan Riccio, the former Apple Hardware Engineering Chief, transitioned to a new role overseeing Apple&#39;s work on developing an AR/VR headset. Apple is said to be working on multiple prototypes for AR/VR headsets, and is expected to first launch an &quot;Apple glasses&quot; product by 2022. Bloomberg has also reported that Apple plans to launch an AR headset similar to FaceBook&#39;s Oculus Quest. Kopin has a long history of research, product success, and high-level partnerships that I think would make it a great candidate to partner with Apple (if they haven&#39;t already, which I think it&#39;s likely that they have and it&#39;s just not public information). </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"/u/madmattmen\">u/madmattmen</a> mentioned, KOPN has been a sleeping giant this past year. Their stock is up almost 2000% this past year, with huge accumulation occurring over the past few months alone. Their Earnings Report was set for 3/9, but they just moved it up a week to 3/2 which suggests good news (they are expected to report their strongest quarter yet). I am extremely bullish on KOPN, and I&#39;m setting my price target at $20 by end-of-year. </p>\n\n<p>Some info I took from <a href=\"/u/Puzzled-Gear-4333\">u/Puzzled-Gear-4333</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>34 million in revenue and Debt Free</li>\n<li>Small cap (under 300 million)</li>\n<li>Over 200 patents mostly related to wearables</li>\n<li>Over 20 patents related to OLED backplane technology</li>\n<li>Great customer base which includes Vuzix, Google (Google Glass), Lenovo, Garmin, Flir, Lockhead Martin, &amp; Collins Aerospace among many others.</li>\n<li>Sole Provider for military and defense programs including LCD pilot helmet visors for F-35 Strike Fighter &amp; LCD eyepiece for next gen thermal imaging rifle sights for U.S. Army</li>\n<li>The anticipate a 4 year 77% Growth in AR/VR spending between 2019-2023</li>\n<li>Cody Willard of <a href=\"https://marketwatch.com/\">MarketWatch.com</a> estimates V/R will be a trillion dollar marketplace within five years <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/virtual-reality-will-be-a-trillion-dollar-marketplace-within-five-years-heres-a-good-example-why-11611320863\">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/virtual-reality-will-be-a-trillion-dollar-marketplace-within-five-years-heres-a-good-example-why-11611320863</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Caveat: I am not a professional, do your own DD, this is not advice, and I bought 50 shares today + plan to buy more with my next paycheck.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lgdk0p/kopn_and_why_i_believe_it_has_100_upside_potential/","title":"KOPN and why I believe it has 100%+ upside potential","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T14:05:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 14:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lgdk0p","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lgdk0p/kopn_and_why_i_believe_it_has_100_upside_potential/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lgdk0p/kopn_and_why_i_believe_it_has_100_upside_potential/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"happy-tripping","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/happy-tripping","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"happy-tripping","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"KOPN以及为什么我相信它有100%以上的上涨潜力？","the_new_excerpt":"对KOPN有什么看法？我没有时间做一个完整的DD，但这里有一些。\n思想。\n\nKOPN(科平公司)最著名的是它的移动显示设备。\n电子产品。公司由麻省理工学院的工程师创立，目前拥有\n数百项适用于增强现实的专利....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"KOPN以及爲什麼我相信它有100%以上的上漲潛力？","the_new_excerpt":"對KOPN有什麼看法？我沒有時間做一個完整的DD，但這裏有一些。\n思想。\n\nKOPN(科平公司)最著名的是它的移動顯示設備。\n電子產品。公司由麻省理工學院的工程師創立，目前擁有\n數百項適用於增強現實的專利....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-loagdc","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loagdc/fortune_cookie_says_dont_stop/","title":"Fortune cookie says don't stop.","date":"February 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"财富饼干说不要停。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"財富餅乾說不要停。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lofha7","excerpt":"So quantum computers can break cryptocurrency in 2 ways.
