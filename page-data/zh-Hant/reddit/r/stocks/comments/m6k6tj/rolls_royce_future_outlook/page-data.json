There is a 50$ fee to buy the stock on some platforms, others (like Robinhood) might hide that fee.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot put certain calls on this probably due to liquidity (not sure, you tell me).</p>\n\n<p>Note* Trading volumes are high enough that you won’t get trapped should it continue to drop. (But you already knew that).</p>\n\n<p>Note* RR has gone through bankruptcy before, even that hasn’t stopped it. Should it go to that extreme again, it might rebound all the same.</p>\n\n<p>PROs:\nOver the next year it should see a LARGE boost in stock price along with the return to travel culture, if not large, than significant, but I have no crystal ball, however my sentiment is shared by many regarding the aviation future.</p>\n\n<p>The have announced exploration avenues and R&amp;D projects that are in the pipeline.</p>\n\n<p>They have a great brand and can leverage other sectors besides aviation to keep them going.</p>\n\n<p>OVERALL:\nRR comes with risk, but seems like it could be one of the huge rewards out there for the taking in later 2022. it seems positioned to easily 4x. If there is a time to buy it is today or the last few weeks. Let me know what you think, how is your risk assessment? Why would or wouldn’t you pick up RR.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m6k6tj/rolls_royce_future_outlook/","title":"Rolls Royce - Future Outlook","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T10:47:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 10:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m6k6tj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6k6tj/rolls_royce_future_outlook/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6k6tj/rolls_royce_future_outlook/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"DontWantUrSoch","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DontWantUrSoch","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DontWantUrSoch","score":44,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"劳斯莱斯 - 未来展望","the_new_excerpt":"这只股票在过去几周出现了一些值得注意的变动，现在还早。\n从图表上看，但它看起来像一个上升的回归到一些以前的水平的。\n价值。\n\nCONs。我确实看了一下这家公司的债务水平，并不会。\n忽略它。买股票要交50元的手续费，在一些...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"勞斯萊斯 - 未來展望","the_new_excerpt":"這隻股票在過去幾周出現了一些值得注意的變動，現在還早。\n從圖表上看，但它看起來像一個上升的迴歸到一些以前的水平的。\n價值。\n\nCONs。我確實看了一下這家公司的債務水平，並不會。\n忽略它。買股票要交50元的手續費，在一些...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m6hcw5","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6hcw5/12_mil_yolo_sorry_first_one_i_had_to_delet_real/","title":"1.2 mil yolo (sorry first one I had to delet real quick and mark out our acct number)","date":"March 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"1.2 mil Yolo (对不起，第一条我必须快速删除，并标出我们的账户号)","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"1.2 mil Yolo (對不起，第一條我必須快速刪除，並標出我們的賬戶號)","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26485608","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26485608","title":"Lost in Thought: Psychological Risks of Meditation","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 17, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"迷失在思想中。冥想的心理风险","locale":"zh"},{"title":"迷失在思想中。冥想的心理風險","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m6k6tj","previousId":"RedditPost-m6hcw5","nextId":"HnPost-26485608","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m6k6tj/rolls_royce_future_outlook/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
