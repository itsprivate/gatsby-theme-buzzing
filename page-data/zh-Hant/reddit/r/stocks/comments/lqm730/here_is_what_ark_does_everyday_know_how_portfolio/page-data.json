If TSLA losses in value they buy more and if it gains more they sell it. They maintain a certain % of portfolio value. TSLA when in losing streak and they buy more to maintain the holding ratio.  As long as ARK doesnt increase the ratio of stock value in portfolio they&#39;re not adding any new positions - so following daily trade from ARK needs further analysis. </p>\n\n<p>ARK is always be trimming or compensating gains and losses so no one position eats up their most part of ETF value.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lqm730/here_is_what_ark_does_everyday_know_how_portfolio/","title":"Here is what ARK does everyday - Know how portfolio rebalancing works","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T18:13:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 18:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lqm730","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lqm730/here_is_what_ark_does_everyday_know_how_portfolio/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lqm730/here_is_what_ark_does_everyday_know_how_portfolio/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"x-w-j","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/x-w-j","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"x-w-j","score":205,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"以下是ARK每天的工作内容--了解投资组合再平衡的工作原理","the_new_excerpt":"我已经看到好几个帖子盲目地跟着ARK做什么。最近...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"以下是ARK每天的工作內容--瞭解投資組合再平衡的工作原理","the_new_excerpt":"我已經看到好幾個帖子盲目地跟着ARK做什麼。最近...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lxxsn8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxxsn8/update_stonks_talking_to_me_today/","title":"UPDATE: $STONKS TALKING TO ME TODAY","date":"March 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"更新：$STONKS今天和我说话。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"更新：$STONKS今天和我說話。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ly5odf","excerpt":"Don't listen to the noise.
