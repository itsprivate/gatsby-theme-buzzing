I could’ve had bought a car but instead I was greedy and got exactly what I put in. It all started well, the stock I’m taking about is, you guessed it, GME.\nI got in around $70, I watched it go up and up and always believed there was more to collect. If I sold at the peak of $480, I could’ve had the biggest gains of my life, but I didn’t. I then sold at $90, had some minor gains which were probably equal to the amount of fees I paid. Why didn’t I sell? Because I was greedy. Now I’m really regretting that. Of course, there are people who’ve lost everything on this and I shouldn’t be complaining, but it hurts being denied money because of my own stupidity. It’s not entirely my fault though, the Hedgefonds we’re pulling servere market manipulation. Anyway, I’m pretty depressed and wanted to know if anyone of you guys could offer some advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lbi38n/missed_out_on_five_digits_gain/","title":"Missed out on five digits gain","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T17:26:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 17:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lbi38n","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbi38n/missed_out_on_five_digits_gain/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbi38n/missed_out_on_five_digits_gain/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"chris2036","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/chris2036","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"chris2036","score":80,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"错过了五位数的收益","the_new_excerpt":"这真是太可怕了。我本来可以买一辆车的，但我却贪婪地...\n得到了我投入的东西。开始都很顺利，我拿的股票是。\n你猜对了，GME。我在70美元左右进场，我看着它一直涨，一直涨，总是\n相信还有更多的收藏。如果我在高峰期卖出... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"錯過了五位數的收益","the_new_excerpt":"這真是太可怕了。我本來可以買一輛車的，但我卻貪婪地...\n得到了我投入的東西。開始都很順利，我拿的股票是。\n你猜對了，GME。我在70美元左右進場，我看着它一直漲，一直漲，總是\n相信還有更多的收藏。如果我在高峯期賣出... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lhwg4r","excerpt":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-earnings-surge-in-disney-subscriptions-leads-to-surprise-profit-11613078561?siteid=yhoof2\n\n“Disney+ has exceeded even our highest expectations,” Chapek said in a\nconference call with analysts [https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/snvice4i]\nlater, noting it…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lhwg4r/surge_by_disney_to_nearly_95_million/","title":"Surge by Disney+ to nearly 95 million subscriptions leads to surprise profit","date":"February 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"迪士尼+订阅量激增至近9500万，带来意外的盈利。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-earnings-surge-in-disney-subscriptions-leads-to-surprise-profit-11613078561?siteid=yhoof2\n\n\"Disney+甚至已经超过了我们的最高期望值。\"Chapek在一份。\n与分析师的电话会议 [https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/snvice4i]\n后来，注意到...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"迪士尼+訂閱量激增至近9500萬，帶來意外的盈利。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-earnings-surge-in-disney-subscriptions-leads-to-surprise-profit-11613078561?siteid=yhoof2\n\n\"Disney+甚至已經超過了我們的最高期望值。\"Chapek在一份。\n與分析師的電話會議 [https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/snvice4i]\n後來，注意到...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1360004435385212932","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1360004435385212932","title":"Disney revenues were down 19% in 2020 and they reported a total net loss of $4.95 billion.\n\nThe stock is up 38% over the last year.\n\n$DIS","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 12, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"迪士尼在2020年的收入下降了19%，他们的净亏损总额为49.5亿美元。\n\n该股在去年上涨了38%。\n\n$DIS","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"迪士尼在2020年的收入下降了19%，他們的淨虧損總額爲49.5億美元。\n\n該股在去年上漲了38%。\n\n$DIS","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lbi38n","previousId":"RedditPost-lhwg4r","nextId":"TweetPost-1360004435385212932","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lbi38n/missed_out_on_five_digits_gain/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
