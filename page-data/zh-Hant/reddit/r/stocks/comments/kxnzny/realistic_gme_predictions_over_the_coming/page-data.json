Nothing too crazy, but I am hoping that I can maximize profit on the squeeze. </p>\n\n<p>Wondering what opinions are about prospects on GME - what will it look like over the next couple of days/weeks? </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen people mentioning a potential high around $90 come Friday, with some slightly lower figures around $60. On the opposite end, I&#39;ve seen people saying it could jump over $100, maybe hitting the low $300s - I saw some more extreme notions that it could clip near $1,000 at a peak squeeze. </p>\n\n<p>Just curious about people&#39;s thoughts on the matter and the timeline for the peaks. I&#39;m siding with Reddit on the general direction, and am optimistic that it plays out in our collective favor - hoping to get some funds to put towards my wife&#39;s business. </p>\n\n<p>If it hits around $90 should I cash out, or is there a considerable likelihood that the $90-100 range is the lower end of what we could realistically expect? I&#39;ll be keeping a close eye on the ticker, but am curious about others&#39; tactics on how long they plan to hold. </p>\n\n<p>I welcome thoughts and opinions! Cheers~</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxnzny/realistic_gme_predictions_over_the_coming/","title":"Realistic $GME predictions over the coming days/weeks?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-15T15:58:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-15 15:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kxnzny","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxnzny/realistic_gme_predictions_over_the_coming/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxnzny/realistic_gme_predictions_over_the_coming/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"jbb3205","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jbb3205","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"jbb3205","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"现实的通用汽车E预测在未来几天/几周？","the_new_excerpt":"用一些长颈鹿的钱跳上了GME火箭，现在手里有20个左右的。\n股。没有什么太疯狂的，但我希望，我可以最大限度地提高利润的\n挤。\n\n\n接下来的几天/几周？\n\n我看到有人...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"現實的通用汽車E預測在未來幾天/幾周？","the_new_excerpt":"用一些長頸鹿的錢跳上了GME火箭，現在手裏有20個左右的。\n股。沒有什麼太瘋狂的，但我希望，我可以最大限度地提高利潤的\n擠。\n\n\n接下來的幾天/幾周？\n\n我看到有人...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25783303","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25783303","title":"Native Americans say U.S. does not own land it is about to give to Rio Tinto","date":"January 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"美国原住民称美国并不拥有其即将给力拓的土地。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國原住民稱美國並不擁有其即將給力拓的土地。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1350072044810022913","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1350072044810022913","title":"US SPACs, IPO capital raised...\n2013: $1 billion\n2014: $2 billion\n2015: $4 billion\n2016: $3 billion\n2017: $11 billion\n2018: $9 billion\n2019: $13 billion\n2020: $83 billion\n2021 YTD: $15 billion in 2 weeks","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 15, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国SPACs、IPO募资...\n2013年：10亿美元\n2014年：20亿美元\n2015年：40亿美元\n2016年：30亿美元\n2017年：110亿美元\n2018年：90亿美元\n2019年：130亿美元\n2020年：830亿美元\n2021年YTD：2周后150亿美元","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國SPACs、IPO募資...\n2013年：10億美元\n2014年：20億美元\n2015年：40億美元\n2016年：30億美元\n2017年：110億美元\n2018年：90億美元\n2019年：130億美元\n2020年：830億美元\n2021年YTD：2周後150億美元","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kxnzny","previousId":"HnPost-25783303","nextId":"TweetPost-1350072044810022913","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxnzny/realistic_gme_predictions_over_the_coming/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
