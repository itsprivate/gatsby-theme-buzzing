The cash had been sitting in my brokerage earning 0% interest for the past year. I am in Canada and the cash are sitting in a RRSP hence i did not transfer it into a interest bearing account because I wanted the cash to remain liquid in a event of a crash. I kept hoping the market would crash so I could buy back in cheaper and that has cost me 2 years of my salary in missed gains. Seeing these gigantic rallies every day I am getting serious FOMO but is also conflicted as buying back in now will be locking in my losses. I dont think I have the mental strength to hold on to all cash much longer and I know I shouldn&#39;t of tried to time the market in the first place but I feel I&#39;m in too deep at this point. I feel like doing a lump sum and be done with it  so i can be free from my mental anguish but with markets at ATH i am still somewhat hesitant, I don&#39;t want to FOMO in at the top and see my holdings crash. Would DCA be a better option? </p>\n\n<p>100K of this money is actually for my parents&#39; retirement. They will be retiring within 5-8 years. I sold their 2% MER mutual fund last year and wanted to buy back the ETF equivalent but because of my greediness I wanted to time the bottom and to buy in cheaper and the market just kept shooting up and i never bought in. The mutual fund allocation was 60/40 equity/fixed income and I was thinking to mirror that but seeing how much bonds are taking a beating and with potential further increases in interest in the near future I&#39;m not sure if bonds are a good idea. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m comfortable in going with an all equity allocation either due to my parent&#39;s short time horizon, can anyone suggest some alternatives?</p>\n\n<p>I know i fucked up huge and probably shouldn&#39;t be doing DIY investing. But please, I am already feeling dead inside. Missing the greatest bull market in history will most likely haunt me for the remainder of my life.  I will never touch the holdings again once fully invested. Would just like some advice on how to put my parent&#39;s money back into the market.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m4yyvz/how_to_invest_180k_with_mental_block_from_huge/","title":"How to invest $180k with mental block from huge losses","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-15T02:48:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-15 02:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m4yyvz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m4yyvz/how_to_invest_180k_with_mental_block_from_huge/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m4yyvz/how_to_invest_180k_with_mental_block_from_huge/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ClosetPervy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ClosetPervy","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ClosetPervy","score":71,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"巨额亏损心理障碍，如何投资18万？","the_new_excerpt":"长话短说，去年三月底我就傻乎乎地卖掉了。\n而且还是100%的现金。这些现金一直放在我的经纪公司，赚取0%的收益。\n过去一年的利息。我在加拿大，现金都放在RRSP里。\n因此，我没有把它转到一个生息账户... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"鉅額虧損心理障礙，如何投資18萬？","the_new_excerpt":"長話短說，去年三月底我就傻乎乎地賣掉了。\n而且還是100%的現金。這些現金一直放在我的經紀公司，賺取0%的收益。\n過去一年的利息。我在加拿大，現金都放在RRSP裏。\n因此，我沒有把它轉到一個生息賬戶... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m58453","excerpt":"https://blogs.imf.org/2021/03/03/the-evidence-is-in-on-negative-interest-rate-policies/\n\nhttps://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/03/01/Negative-Interest-Rates-Taking-Stock-of-the-Experience-So-Far-50115\n\nInterest rates are low, and “lower for longer” has…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m58453/the_evidence_is_in_on_negative_interest_rate/","title":"The evidence is in on negative interest rate policies, and it has largely worked","date":"March 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"负利率政策证据确凿，且基本奏效","the_new_excerpt":"https://blogs.imf.org/2021/03/03/the-evidence-is-in-on-negative-interest-rate-policies/\n\nhttps://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/03/01/Negative-Interest-Rates-Taking-Stock-of-the-Experience-So-Far-50115\n\n利率低了，\"低久一点 \"有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"負利率政策證據確鑿，且基本奏效","the_new_excerpt":"https://blogs.imf.org/2021/03/03/the-evidence-is-in-on-negative-interest-rate-policies/\n\nhttps://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/03/01/Negative-Interest-Rates-Taking-Stock-of-the-Experience-So-Far-50115\n\n利率低了，\"低久一點 \"有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m592rq","excerpt":"Anyone who spent some time studying the basics of investing knows about\ndollar-cost averaging.
