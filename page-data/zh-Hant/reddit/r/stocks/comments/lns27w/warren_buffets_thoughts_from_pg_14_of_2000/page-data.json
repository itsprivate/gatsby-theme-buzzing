By shamelessly merchandising birdless bushes, promoters have in recent years moved billions of dollars from the pockets of the public to their own purses (and to those of their friends and associates). The fact is that a bubble market has allowed the creation of bubble companies, entities designed more with an eye to making money off investors rather than for them. Too often, an IPO, not profits, was the primary goal of a company’s promoters. At bottom, the “business model” for these companies has been the old-fashioned chain letter, for which many fee-hungry investment bankers acted as eager postmen.  </p>\n\n<p>But a pin lies in wait for every bubble. And when the two eventually meet, a new wave of investors learns some very old lessons: First, many in Wall Street ¾ a community in which quality control is not prized ¾ will sell investors anything they will buy. Second, speculation is most dangerous when it looks easiest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Warren Buffet wrote this in his year 2000 shareholder letter, which I read for the first time today. It was interesting as it might be something to consider and think about as we continue to fly high. I don&#39;t profess to knowing anything about valuations, but clearly we have been doing quite well for quite some time. I, for one, am not intelligent enough to try and beat the market so I just DCA into boring ETFs and funds and am satisfied doing so, but nonetheless, these paragraphs were interesting to me as it seemed to be potentially relevant to all of the news that has been coming out lately.  </p>\n\n<p>With so many new traders and so much more ease of access to the world of finance, hopefully, we see even more transparency and ease of access to information, as well. As I continue to learn and understand more I find there is an increased need for the great input and sharing of ideas that a community like this can provide.   </p>\n\n<p>I am interested to know if you all think we are at risk of, yet again, replicating what Buffet spoke of in 2000.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lns27w/warren_buffets_thoughts_from_pg_14_of_2000/","title":"Warren Buffet's thoughts from pg 14 of 2000 shareholder letter","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-20T06:22:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-20 06:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lns27w","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lns27w/warren_buffets_thoughts_from_pg_14_of_2000/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lns27w/warren_buffets_thoughts_from_pg_14_of_2000/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"fpsoneone","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/fpsoneone","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"fpsoneone","score":65,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lw4qgi","excerpt":"just for you.","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw4qgi/fuck_it_heres_your_daily_gme_threadmegathread_3221/","title":"Fuck it, Heres your daily GME Thread-Megathread 3/2/21","date":"March 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"妈的，这是你每天的GME话题--超级话题3/2/21","the_new_excerpt":"只为你。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"媽的，這是你每天的GME話題--超級話題3/2/21","the_new_excerpt":"只爲你。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1366744479135391744","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1366744479135391744","title":"President Biden will announce later Tuesday that Merck &amp; Co. will help make Johnson &amp; Johnson's one-shot COVID-19 vaccine in an unusual agreement between two competitors that could lead to a significant boost in supply, the Washington Post reported. $JNJ https://t.co/avxTv8aJLI https://t.co/2dAorcqFix","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 02, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"据华盛顿邮报报道，总统拜登将在周二晚些时候宣布，默克公司将帮助生产强生公司的一针COVID-19疫苗，这是两个竞争对手之间的一项不同寻常的协议，可能会导致供应量大幅增加。$JNJ https://t.co/avxTv8aJLI https://t.co/2dAorcqFix","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"據華盛頓郵報報道，總統拜登將在週二晚些時候宣佈，默克公司將幫助生產強生公司的一針COVID-19疫苗，這是兩個競爭對手之間的一項不同尋常的協議，可能會導致供應量大幅增加。$JNJ https://t.co/avxTv8aJLI https://t.co/2dAorcqFix","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lns27w","previousId":"RedditPost-lw4qgi","nextId":"TweetPost-1366744479135391744","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lns27w/warren_buffets_thoughts_from_pg_14_of_2000/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
