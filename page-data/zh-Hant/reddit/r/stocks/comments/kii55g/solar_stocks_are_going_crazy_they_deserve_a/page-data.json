CSIQ has now had 3 consecutive days gaining 8%+, two of those days gaining 11%. SPWR finished at 12% today and doubled over the past 2 months. ENPH got the credit it deserved from big-name institutions and finished up 30% in the past week, again doubling in the past two months.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s not to say that solar hasn&#39;t had a phenomenal year in general either. RUN, ENPH, SPWR, PLUG, etc. are all examples of companies that have seen 3, 4, 5, even 9x growth this year. What&#39;s more, many of them (SPWR, CSIQ) still have extremely stomache-able fundamentals. </p>\n\n<p>A large portion of this growth is under Trump, who was obviously not a proponent of green energy. I take this to mean that since solar can show astronomical growth in adversity, it could yield amazing growth under the right conditions. </p>\n\n<p>What solar stocks do you all think are holes-in-one? Why? Where do you think the industry is going in 2021? What upsides/downsides are people not talking about? If people invest now are they catching the tail-end of a fluke, or is this just the beginning?</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I&#39;m invested in CSIQ, ENPH, SPWR, and QCLN. They&#39;ve all worked like magic in my portfolio. I&#39;d like to hear what you guys are invested in with the green energy space.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: forgot about TAN. I&#39;m holding them as well</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kii55g/solar_stocks_are_going_crazy_they_deserve_a/","title":"Solar stocks are going crazy.
