It is too important for the economy. </p>\n\n<p>Tesla produced 509,000 cars in 2020. That is 18× LESS of what Toyota produced and sold in 2020, yet Tesla is valued at 4X the Market Cap of Toyota.</p>\n\n<p>The dot.com bubble is microscopic compared to this bubble. This is the VY Canis Majoris of all stock market bubbles, and it cannot burst because it would trigger a ripple effect in the economy.</p>\n\n<p>TESLA has a negative 900 million net income (loss) and its stock value keeps rising and rising (frenzy) as if Tesla owned Space X and all of Elon&#39;s companies that are not part of Tesla.</p>\n\n<p>This frenzy, fueled by people simply buying on any dip telling themselves &quot;Tesla will revolutionize the world&quot; Investing all their life&#39;s saving every time Elon does anything: Elon is wearing kahki pants today, here 5K more of my savings, Elon moved to Texas here 20K more of my savings, Elon is making a super ultra futuristic &quot;advanced&quot; battery for a car that takes you from A to B like any other car, here 10K more of my savings, Elon tweeted Unicorn, that must mean something, here I refinanced my home to invest it all in Tesla, Elon farted today, here 5K more! This is just crazy. Teenagers and college students are just buying and buying Tesla and they have no clue about Tesla&#39;s balance sheet.</p>\n\n<p>Based on car sales, Tesla is worth $12 Billion.</p>\n\n<p>500,000 car sales cannot justify a trillion dollar market cap. Tesla shareholders will get burned.</p>\n\n<p>It might burst in 2021. It is just too big. If it doubles, the market cap would reach 1.7 Trillion.</p>\n\n<p>Apple has a 2.4 Trillion market cap because it is a leader in cell phones sales worldwide in addition to the billions it makes in computer and laptop sales, and other tech. Apple makes financial sense but Tesla does not even produce a positive income. Apple made $57.411 Billion in NET income in 2020 while Tesla made negative 900 million in 2019 and had a greater loss in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>If this bubble bursts a lot of people will get hurt, particularly YOUNG investors. All the paper millionaires will become poor in a few days, similar to what occured when the dot.com bubble burst.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Tesla has a machinery of people just hired to post positive Tesla news on Reddit to keep pumping it&#39;s stock value up. The most common brainwashing phrases: &quot;Tesla is not just a car company, Tesla is the Future&quot; &quot;Tesla&#39;s Autonomous driving will take over the world&quot; and more nonsense.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l54hg6/tesla_the_mother_of_all_bubbles/","title":"TESLA: the mother of all bubbles.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T07:35:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 07:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l54hg6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l54hg6/tesla_the_mother_of_all_bubbles/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l54hg6/tesla_the_mother_of_all_bubbles/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"_bono983","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/_bono983","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"_bono983","score":98,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"TESLA：所有泡沫之母。","the_new_excerpt":"美国GDP=21万亿（整个美国经济） TESLA市值=0.834万亿。\n(近一万亿)\n\n特斯拉的泡沫不能破。它对经济太重要了。\n\n特斯拉在2020年生产了50.9万辆汽车。这是丰田公司产量的18倍。\n并在2020年出售，但特斯拉的估值却高达4倍，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"TESLA：所有泡沫之母。","the_new_excerpt":"美國GDP=21萬億（整個美國經濟） TESLA市值=0.834萬億。\n(近一萬億)\n\n特斯拉的泡沫不能破。它對經濟太重要了。\n\n特斯拉在2020年生產了50.9萬輛汽車。這是豐田公司產量的18倍。\n並在2020年出售，但特斯拉的估值卻高達4倍，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26006731","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26006731","title":"Show HN: Archivy – Extensible Self Hosted Knowledge Base – v1 Release","date":"February 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"显示 HN: Archivy - 可扩展的自助式知识库 - v1 版本","locale":"zh"},{"title":"顯示 HN: Archivy - 可擴展的自助式知識庫 - v1 版本","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lbaktb","excerpt":"Edit: There's a lot of great responses and info about my questions in the\ncomments!
