Doesn&#39;t all the brand spanking new investors bode well for the long term?  My thought is: A lot of these people who got swept up in the GME YOLO wave and all that are not going to stick around, but there has to be a decent amount who have always been interested in stocks and didn&#39;t jump in before.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the latter who are sticking around to learn (I hope I am one of these) will eventually turn into knowledgeable traders who provide more money, new ideas or DD and better discussion right?</p>\n\n<p>Also, from what I understand of frozen concentrated orange juice, the market is brutal to the consistently foolish and emotional traders.  One the flip side of the coin will be people who can&#39;t handle it and get chewed up and spit out by everyone else.  I hope these kind of traders can get out without getting hurt too badly.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I wanted to hear from some folks on here on what they think about all of that.  Does having all these new users asking questions all the time beneficial in the long run or is it just the nuisance of newbies asking questions that can easily be looked up and who will quickly be gone?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lntqrx/flood_of_new_investors_thoughtdiscussion/","title":"Flood of new investors thought/discussion","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-20T05:33:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-20 05:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lntqrx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lntqrx/flood_of_new_investors_thoughtdiscussion/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lntqrx/flood_of_new_investors_thoughtdiscussion/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"dafood00","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/dafood00","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"dafood00","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26311801","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26311801","title":"Element Matrix Services Announces Element Home","date":"March 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"元素矩阵服务发布Element Home","locale":"zh"},{"title":"元素矩陣服務發佈Element Home","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lw0pdx","excerpt":"Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) today announced its financial results for the fourth\nquarter and full year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nQ4 GAAP EPS of -$1.06 misses by $0.22.\n\nRevenue +102%YOY\n\nGross profit +102%YOY\n\nGarena - bookings +111% YOY, rev. +72% YOY\n\n-QAUs 611m(+72%YOY)\n\n-Paying users 73.1m…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lw0pdx/sea_limited_se_reports_fourth_quarter_and_full/","title":"Sea Limited ($SE) Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Results","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 02, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Sea Limited ($SE)公布第四季度及2020年全年业绩。","the_new_excerpt":"Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) 今天公布了其第四季度的财务业绩。\n季度和截至2020年12月31日的全年。\n\nQ4 GAAP EPS为-1.06美元，差0.22美元。\n\n收入+102%YOY\n\n毛利按年增长102%\n\nGarena - 预订量+111% YOY, Rev. +72% YOY. +按年升72%\n\n-质量单位6.11亿(+72%同比)\n\n-付费用户7310万...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Sea Limited ($SE)公佈第四季度及2020年全年業績。","the_new_excerpt":"Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) 今天公佈了其第四季度的財務業績。\n季度和截至2020年12月31日的全年。\n\nQ4 GAAP EPS爲-1.06美元，差0.22美元。\n\n收入+102%YOY\n\n毛利按年增長102%\n\nGarena - 預訂量+111% YOY, Rev. +72% YOY. +按年升72%\n\n-質量單位6.11億(+72%同比)\n\n-付費用戶7310萬...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lntqrx","previousId":"HnPost-26311801","nextId":"RedditPost-lw0pdx","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lntqrx/flood_of_new_investors_thoughtdiscussion/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
