I&#39;m talking index funds and ETFs, the boring but good stuff. Ended 2020 with a 34% return thanks to the raging bull market which made me pour even more money into it. I bought into the GME hype at $34 dollars but eventually dca&#39;d my way to a solid $64 average cost. I got caught up in the bullish GME echo chamber that <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/\">r/wallstreetbets</a> now is - I was just lucky to get in and out early compared to others.</p>\n\n<p>As WSB&#39;s member count went through the roof, more and more users commented price targets and abusing people into not selling. By going to these users&#39; history, a lot - and I mean A LOT - had comments from 2 days ago along the lines of &quot;where to buy stocks?&quot;. It just made the echo chamber even clearer. These people, who had no idea, were commenting advice and about the future of GME. I&#39;m a beginner too but I wouldn&#39;t even think of pretending like I have a clue. The quote “If shoe shine boys are giving stock tips, then it&#39;s time to get out of the market&quot; have always stuck with me, but I never put much credibility into it, until now.</p>\n\n<p>I eventually dca&#39;d my way out at an average cost of $206 after reading about the conspiracy theories about why the reported 53% short interest was false. Maybe it is false and maybe these hedge have pulled off a great move in suppressing this % without actually covering in order to mislead investors, but I would never bet on that. Took $3.1k profit which was cool, but this whole situation has made me realize the importance of being independent.</p>\n\n<p>It has motivated me to actually learn how to read a balance sheet, do my own due diligence and come to my own conclusions - not depend on others. Reddit, Seeking Alpha and Twitter are great resources to take inspiration from, but I&#39;ll never invest through someone else&#39;s thesis again even though it worked out this time. The only thing that separates me from the guy who bought at $400 is that I picked up on the information earlier. We were both &quot;promised&quot; $1000, which I always saw as ridiculous but hey, &quot;everyone is spamming it so it must be true&quot;. No, that echo chamber mentality is dangerous and a lot of people have lost a lot of money as a product of it. You never know who&#39;s on the other side spamming their thesis. Might be Warren Buffet or a guy who downloaded *insert controversial broker here* 2 days ago - I won&#39;t blindly follow their advice either way.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lb7r9n/gme_taught_me_the_importance_of_being_independent/","title":"GME taught me the importance of being independent","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T00:39:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 00:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lb7r9n","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lb7r9n/gme_taught_me_the_importance_of_being_independent/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lb7r9n/gme_taught_me_the_importance_of_being_independent/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"WiLjjam","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/WiLjjam","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"WiLjjam","score":889,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME教会了我独立的重要性","the_new_excerpt":"2020年夏天，我18岁的时候就开始投资了。我说的是\n指数基金和ETF，枯燥无味却又是好东西。2020年年底，回报率34%。\n感谢汹涌的牛市，让我投入了更多的资金。I\n买进GME炒作34美元，但最终DCA'D我的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME教會了我獨立的重要性","the_new_excerpt":"2020年夏天，我18歲的時候就開始投資了。我說的是\n指數基金和ETF，枯燥無味卻又是好東西。2020年年底，回報率34%。\n感謝洶湧的牛市，讓我投入了更多的資金。I\n買進GME炒作34美元，但最終DCA'D我的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lh60za","excerpt":"(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc said on Wednesday it was planning to offer support\nfor some cryptocurrencies on its network this year, joining a string of\nbig-ticket firms that have pledged similar support.\n\nThe credit-card giant’s announcement comes days after Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc\nrevealed it had…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lh60za/mastercard_to_open_up_network_to_select/","title":"Mastercard to open up network to select cryptocurrencies","date":"February 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"万事达卡将对部分加密货币开放网络","the_new_excerpt":"(路透社)--万事达卡公司周三表示，计划提供支持。\n为今年其网络上的一些加密货币，加入了一连串的。\n大票公司，已经承诺提供类似的支持。\n\n在埃隆-马斯克（Elon Musk）的特斯拉公司（Tesla Inc.\n揭示了它已经...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"萬事達卡將對部分加密貨幣開放網絡","the_new_excerpt":"(路透社)--萬事達卡公司週三表示，計劃提供支持。\n爲今年其網絡上的一些加密貨幣，加入了一連串的。\n大票公司，已經承諾提供類似的支持。\n\n在埃隆-馬斯克（Elon Musk）的特斯拉公司（Tesla Inc.\n揭示了它已經...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26096340","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26096340","title":"Why Wasn't Ruby 3 Faster?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 11, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么Ruby 3的速度不快？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼Ruby 3的速度不快？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lb7r9n","previousId":"RedditPost-lh60za","nextId":"HnPost-26096340","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lb7r9n/gme_taught_me_the_importance_of_being_independent/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
