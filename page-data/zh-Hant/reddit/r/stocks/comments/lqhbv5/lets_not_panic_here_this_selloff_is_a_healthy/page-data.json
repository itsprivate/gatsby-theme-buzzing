Relax.  This is not the apocalypse. This is not the armageddon.</p>\n\n<p>Before I get into what&#39;s happening, here is a bit of perspective: Even with yesterday&#39;s selloff, NASDAQ ended at 13,533. I can&#39;t see what the index is like pre-market, but QQQ is down 1.35% as I write this. So let&#39;s assume it opens 13,350.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s still 280 points higher than the post-January selloff (low of 13,070). That&#39;s also still 462 points higher than December 31st (we closed at 12,888). In %, that&#39;s 2.14% and 3.58% higher, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Now I know that a lot of you are trading on highly volatile stocks (looking at you, CRSR and PLTR), so obviously they are hit much harder than NASDAQ. That&#39;s the nature of the beast. Volatile stocks = large swings, both up and down. Welcome to the flip side. I have some of those in my portfolio, and also some defensive and cyclical stocks. It sucks those volatile positions deep in the red. I know how you all feel.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now, what&#39;s happening?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Treasury yields are rising.</strong> That&#39;s what&#39;s happening. There&#39;s obviously more to it (I.e.: vaccination seems to be going relatively well, Biden&#39;s stimulus, etc.), but that seems to be the catalyst. In fact, the 10-year yield rose to its highest level in the last year, at 1.37%. <strong>That&#39;s a good thing:</strong> Rising yields are a sign of economic recovery and increasing economic activity. It&#39;s a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>Why are yields rising if interest rates remain low? Because of one of the fundamentals of yields: As bond prices rise, everything else being equal, yields will drop. And the inverse is also true. As bond prices drop, yields will rise. And right now, bond prices are dropping. People are becoming more and more optimistic about the prospect of recovery, with Biden&#39;s stimulus and with the vaccination that is (once again, relatively) going well. So they are exiting &quot;safe&quot; investments with lower yields in favor of riskier investments with higher yields: junkier bonds, stock market and alternative investments.</p>\n\n<p>Wait, if rising yields are a sign of people exiting the bond markets to go towards the stock markets, why are prices dropping????? Great question, and my answer is twofold: (1) NASDAQ is not even in market correction territory, Chill. It closed roughly down 5% from all time highs yesterday. (2) Look at S&amp;P500 and DIJA. DIJA is a winner in this, and S&amp;P is barely phased.</p>\n\n<p>So back to my explanation, people are leaving bond markets for markets with higher potential returns, and the stock markets is one of them. Now, the reality is that rising yields are not always immediately good for markets, especially overheated markets like NASDAQ: This can spook a lot of investors and cause a selloff, which is essentially what&#39;s happening right now. This doesn&#39;t mean, however, that the apocalypse is upon us. Remember one of the reasons why the markets have skyrocketed so much in the last year: Actual interest rates, not yields, are near zero, and will remain near zero for the foreseeable future. This is crucial. New bond issuance will still have shit for yields, this isn&#39;t changing.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>What should we do?</strong> That&#39;s entirely up to you. I&#39;m no financial advisor. I&#39;m no expert. Take everything I say with a massive grain of salt. I&#39;m no expert. But really, I&#39;m barely doing anything. I&#39;ll be taking a page from Cathy&#39;s book: keeping a close eye on when this new craze slows down, sell some of my &quot;safer, less impacted stocks&quot; to raise cash and buy the ones that were hit hardest.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lqhbv5/lets_not_panic_here_this_selloff_is_a_healthy/","title":"Let's not panic here - This selloff is a healthy market reaction to rising treasury yields","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T13:24:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 13:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lqhbv5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lqhbv5/lets_not_panic_here_this_selloff_is_a_healthy/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lqhbv5/lets_not_panic_here_this_selloff_is_a_healthy/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"MrMooMoo-","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MrMooMoo-","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"MrMooMoo-","score":4861,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我们不要在这里恐慌--这次抛售是市场对国债收益率上升的健康反应。","the_new_excerpt":"免责声明：我把一个非常复杂的话题严重简化，以保持\n本帖简介。\n\n各位，关闭你的交易软件。深吸一口气。放松。这不是...\n启示录。这不是世界末日。\n\n在我说到发生了什么之前，这里有一点看法。 Before I get into what's happening, here is a bit of perspective: 甚至...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們不要在這裏恐慌--這次拋售是市場對國債收益率上升的健康反應。","the_new_excerpt":"免責聲明：我把一個非常複雜的話題嚴重簡化，以保持\n本帖簡介。\n\n各位，關閉你的交易軟件。深吸一口氣。放鬆。這不是...\n啓示錄。這不是世界末日。\n\n在我說到發生了什麼之前，這裏有一點看法。 Before I get into what's happening, here is a bit of perspective: 甚至...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lxpxli","excerpt":"So all you new traders talked about how these companies do not have enough\n\"gains.\" Look at it now.
