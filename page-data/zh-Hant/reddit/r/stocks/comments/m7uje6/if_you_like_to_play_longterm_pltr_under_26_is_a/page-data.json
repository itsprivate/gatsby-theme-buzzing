I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty of bearish cases for PLTR, but looking historically, the price tends to float between 24 and 26 when it&#39;s doing nothing, and could probably hit 30 on a good day, but if you want to stock up on shares, and there&#39;s no news, you should try to buy your shares between this range. If you get in under 24, you&#39;re doing very well, but even between this range, you&#39;ll be profitable in the future. Of course, this advice is only good if PLTR doesn&#39;t come out with a brilliant earnings report, a new project that will solve world hunger, or find a cure for cancer, but in general, this is the best entry range to ensure you don&#39;t miss out on any upward momentum, while saving yourself from any major losses.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m7uje6/if_you_like_to_play_longterm_pltr_under_26_is_a/","title":"If you like to play long-term, PLTR under 26 is a good steal","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-18T17:50:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-18 17:50","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m7uje6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7uje6/if_you_like_to_play_longterm_pltr_under_26_is_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7uje6/if_you_like_to_play_longterm_pltr_under_26_is_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"RowanHarley","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/RowanHarley","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"RowanHarley","score":155,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果你喜欢长期玩，26岁以下的PLTR是个不错的抢手货。","the_new_excerpt":"我不太清楚PLTRs的短期前景是什么，它们是综合的。\n与AWS的合作，我认为这将对他们的长久发展非常有利，同时也是\n其项目提供给反恐分析师、对冲基金、银行。\n金融公司。我相信PLTR有很多看空的案例，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果你喜歡長期玩，26歲以下的PLTR是個不錯的搶手貨。","the_new_excerpt":"我不太清楚PLTRs的短期前景是什麼，它們是綜合的。\n與AWS的合作，我認爲這將對他們的長久發展非常有利，同時也是\n其項目提供給反恐分析師、對沖基金、銀行。\n金融公司。我相信PLTR有很多看空的案例，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26499528","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26499528","title":"Spartan School (2019)","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"斯巴达学校(2019)","locale":"zh"},{"title":"斯巴達學校(2019)","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m7ntcd","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7ntcd/im_using_diamond_hands/","title":"I'm using Diamond Hands💎🙌","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 18, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我正在使用钻石手💎🙌。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我正在使用鑽石手💎🙌。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m7uje6","previousId":"HnPost-26499528","nextId":"RedditPost-m7ntcd","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m7uje6/if_you_like_to_play_longterm_pltr_under_26_is_a/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
