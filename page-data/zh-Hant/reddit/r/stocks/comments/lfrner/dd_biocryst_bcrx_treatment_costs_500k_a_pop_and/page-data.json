There’s about 10,750 HAE patients in the U.S. alone.</p>\n\n<p>Let me take a pause to mention that having HAE fucking sucks. People get massive swelling pretty much completely randomly, including in their airway (bad — can’t breathe) or their gut (bad — vomiting, can’t eat). The treatment fucking sucks, which is basically getting C1 inhibitor from donor blood administered IV (or more commonly fresh frozen plasma which contains C1 inhibitors). As you might imagine this is incredibly fucking disruptive to their life.</p>\n\n<p>So given the fresh DD on $BCRX, I thought to myself, “the parts of my brain used for numbers are smooth because I just memorized everything like they said to in medical school, but here’s something I can get real insight into!”</p>\n\n<p>I spoke with a few of my colleagues in Hematology who mentioned that they’ve had tons of patients switch from Haegarda (requires injection) and Cinryze (requires injection) to Orladeyo (just an oral pill). Patients hate self-injecting medications. Many of them are queasy, or you have to get a family member to help you, and it reminds you that you’re chronically sick. We have patients who go to the emergency room over and over again because we can’t convince them to start on new medications. All of these patients have been started on Orladeyo and have since avoided the ER, saving society tons of money.</p>\n\n<p>Positions: $12C 1/21/22 x 500 at an average cost of $4 in the last week (to account for earnings from this year’s Berotralstat sales) -- it&#39;s traded sideways so far.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lfrner/dd_biocryst_bcrx_treatment_costs_500k_a_pop_and/","title":"DD: Biocryst ($BCRX) treatment costs $500k a pop and it’s selling like hotcakes","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T03:39:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 03:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lfrner","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lfrner/dd_biocryst_bcrx_treatment_costs_500k_a_pop_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lfrner/dd_biocryst_bcrx_treatment_costs_500k_a_pop_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"HourPath","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HourPath","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"HourPath","score":610,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"DD：生物晶体($BCRX)治疗费用50万一个，而且卖得很火爆。","the_new_excerpt":"简单的总结。\n\n * 我是个医生\n *患者喜欢他们的药物，Berotralstat (Orladeyo)，因为他们不喜欢。\n   需自注\n * Orladeyo一年的费用是50万，而且得到了保险公司的认可。\n * 这意味着，仅此一种药物，BCRX的价值就被低估了10倍--（121美元）。\n   vs0","locale":"zh"},{"title":"DD：生物晶體($BCRX)治療費用50萬一個，而且賣得很火爆。","the_new_excerpt":"簡單的總結。\n\n * 我是個醫生\n *患者喜歡他們的藥物，Berotralstat (Orladeyo)，因爲他們不喜歡。\n   需自注\n * Orladeyo一年的費用是50萬，而且得到了保險公司的認可。\n * 這意味着，僅此一種藥物，BCRX的價值就被低估了10倍--（121美元）。\n   vs0","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26179162","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26179162","title":"Facebook knew for years ad reach estimates were based on ‘wrong data’","date":"February 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Facebook多年来一直知道广告到达率的估计是基于 \"错误的数据\"。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Facebook多年來一直知道廣告到達率的估計是基於 \"錯誤的數據\"。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lmxbr3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmxbr3/the_ceo_of_reddit_raising_what_seems_to_be_a_nice/","title":"The CEO of Reddit raising what seems to be a nice glass of IPA after his testimony on the Robinhood™️ hearing today like a boss !","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 19, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Reddit的CEO今天在Robinhood™️听证会上作证后，像个老板一样，举起了似乎是一杯不错的IPA!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Reddit的CEO今天在Robinhood™️聽證會上作證後，像個老闆一樣，舉起了似乎是一杯不錯的IPA!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lfrner","previousId":"HnPost-26179162","nextId":"RedditPost-lmxbr3","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lfrner/dd_biocryst_bcrx_treatment_costs_500k_a_pop_and/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
