I did that for 1 month and my portfolio, made up of 18 stocks, is <strong>now up +40%</strong>, with some stocks <strong>up +165%</strong>. Here is the portfolio: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IiVUe3LtMWRpEix_e5xuDTidy6h_iBLcc3_bN6OJo2o/edit#gid=0\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IiVUe3LtMWRpEix_e5xuDTidy6h_iBLcc3_bN6OJo2o/edit#gid=0</a></p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the process I go through to find those stocks - <strong>you&#39;ll see it&#39;s more complex than just trusting a program blindly:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>My program is made out of a Python script that scans Reddit (all finance-related subs) and Twitter and bubbles up stocks that just started generating conversations. So we’re not talking about the over discussed meme stocks like TSLA and such. We’re talking about the next ones.</li>\n<li>How does it do that? My python script looks for stock tickers and finds out the number of mentions they each generate on Reddit and Twitter. Every ticker that generated a lot of chatter based on a DoD (day-on-day), WoW and MoM analysis will be added to the script&#39;s output.</li>\n<li>Once the list is compiled, I apply a level of human curation by reviewing each stock and determining whether the conversations around those are indicative of potential PnDs, high volatility, pumps without fundamentals etc. If so, I filter them out.</li>\n<li>Once I have created my own list of stocks I deem &quot;under-the-radar&quot; and &quot;emerging&quot; - so, again, not your TSLA or NIO - I run my own DDs on each and determine whether they&#39;re worth investing in.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So far I&#39;m really happy with the results. I feel more and more that <strong>a mix of machine-driven data analysis and human curation</strong> is the way to go here, as opposed to simply trusting the program I built - which has sometimes led me to poor investments (hi Hyliion 😬).</p>\n\n<p>What do you all think? I&#39;d be really curious to hear your thoughts and any ideas you may have on how to improve such experiment.</p>\n\n<p>Wishing you all a great week!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lfcodk/i_let_a_program_pick_my_stocks_for_1_month/","title":"I let a program pick my stocks for 1 month.
