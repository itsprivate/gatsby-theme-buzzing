Last year, the government supported Nio by offering it a RMB7 billion (US$1b) bailout last year, providing the company some much needed financial support (the company&#39;s cash was down to RMB863m at the end of 2019 from RMB3.1b in the preceding year).  </p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-motors-nyse-nio-chinese-164539129.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-motors-nyse-nio-chinese-164539129.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence, this seems to be a very risky stock.

Because:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>NIO and other Chinese stocks have 3 years to comply with the legislation.</li>\n<li>If they fail to do so, they might be delisted from NYSE but <strong>NOT</strong> from the other stock exchanges.
