DoorDash was trading at 19 times. However, accounting standards can vary from company to company.</p>\n\n<p>DoorDash should be worth $40 a share, Citron said, citing intense competition in the market for food delivery, lack of brand loyalty from customers and potential government regulation. That would represent a 74% decline from Thursday’s closing price.</p>\n\n<p>DoorDash has gained 51% since its debut last week. It fell 2.4% to $154.21 on Thursday. DoorDash declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p>The market debut of DoorDash was one of the most anticipated of 2020, already a banner year for startups going public. Back in June, private investors had valued the San Francisco-based company at $16 billion. When it opened for trading on Dec. 9, its fully diluted value topped $68 billion.</p>\n\n<p>DoorDash, the largest food delivery app in the U.S., faces strong competition, notably from Uber and Grubhub. Uber tried to acquire Grubhub this year, until Just Eat Takeaway.com NV intervened. Uber bought Postmates instead.</p>\n\n<p>Now DoorDash is eyeing delivery beyond just meals. The company started ferrying around convenience store items such as toilet paper this spring, which puts it in closer competition with giants such as Amazon.com Inc.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/doordash-sinks-citron-calls-ipo-185040810.html\">Source</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kf7zxl/doordash_slips_after_citron_calls_ipo_most/","title":"DoorDash Slips After Citron Calls IPO ‘Most Ridiculous’ of 2020","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"December 18, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-18T19:30:26.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-18 19:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kf7zxl","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kf7zxl/doordash_slips_after_citron_calls_ipo_most/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kf7zxl/doordash_slips_after_citron_calls_ipo_most/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Brothanogood","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Brothanogood","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Brothanogood","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"DoorDash股价下滑，雪铁龙称IPO为2020年来最荒谬的一次","the_new_excerpt":"DoorDash Inc.股价周四下跌，此前卖空者雪铁龙研究公司(Citron Research)\n形容这家送餐公司的首次公开募股(IPO)是“最多的\n他说，该股的价值只有目前的一小部分\n价格。\n\n直接竞争对手，包括GrubHub Inc.，优步技术…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"DoorDash股價下滑，雪鐵龍稱IPO爲2020年來最荒謬的一次","the_new_excerpt":"DoorDash Inc.股價週四下跌，此前賣空者雪鐵龍研究公司(Citron Research)\n形容這家送餐公司的首次公開募股(IPO)是“最多的\n他說，該股的價值只有目前的一小部分\n價格。\n\n直接競爭對手，包括GrubHub Inc.，優步技術…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kq8h99","excerpt":"Stocks end 2020 on the high note with Tesla closing over 700$.
