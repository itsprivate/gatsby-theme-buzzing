The plan “would make equity markets overly complex and increase hidden costs for investors”, the statement said.</p>\n\n<p>The filings were made in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Of Columbia Circuit.</p>\n\n<p>The Wall Street Journal reported that Cboe Global Markets, which operates the Chicago Board Options Exchange, was also suing the SEC over the issue. Cboe did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>The lawsuit is the latest legal action taken by the exchanges against the SEC in recent years, which include a successful challenge to a proposed experiment by the SEC to cap trading fees on 1,400 different stocks.</p>\n\n<p>The SEC is also dealing with other suits. In October, Citadel Securities sued the commission over its decision to approve a new mechanism for trading stocks at exchange operator IEX Group Inc.</p>\n\n<p>Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Edwina Gibbs</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lgsx6w/reuters_nasdaq_new_york_stock_exchange_sue_sec/","title":"Reuters: “Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange sue SEC over planned overhaul of public data feeds”","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T15:29:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 15:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lgsx6w","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lgsx6w/reuters_nasdaq_new_york_stock_exchange_sue_sec/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lgsx6w/reuters_nasdaq_new_york_stock_exchange_sue_sec/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"carpedonnelly","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/carpedonnelly","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"carpedonnelly","score":611,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"路透社，\"纳斯达克、纽约证券交易所起诉美国证券交易委员会 \"纳斯达克，纽约证券交易所起诉美国证券交易委员会 计划对公共数据源进行全面改革\"","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-lawsuit-nyse-nasdaq-idUSKBN2AA09P\n\n(路透社)--纳斯达克公司和纽约证券交易所已分别起诉。\n证券交易委员会，寻求阻止监管机构的一项计划。\n彻底改革向投资者播报股价的公共数据源，... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"路透社，\"納斯達克、紐約證券交易所起訴美國證券交易委員會 \"納斯達克，紐約證券交易所起訴美國證券交易委員會 計劃對公共數據源進行全面改革\"","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-lawsuit-nyse-nasdaq-idUSKBN2AA09P\n\n(路透社)--納斯達克公司和紐約證券交易所已分別起訴。\n證券交易委員會，尋求阻止監管機構的一項計劃。\n徹底改革向投資者播報股價的公共數據源，... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26206513","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26206513","title":"New plant-based plastics can be chemically recycled with near-perfect efficiency","date":"February 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"新型植物基塑料可以以近乎完美的效率进行化学回收利用","locale":"zh"},{"title":"新型植物基塑料可以以近乎完美的效率進行化學回收利用","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lod00m","excerpt":"I get it.
