It seems to me it warrants a high ratio.” Don’t you know,” my friend replied, somewhat puzzled, “that that company is mainly a machine shop? That puts it into a low-growth industry classification.”</strong> this is so eerily similar to tesla, not only does the guy say a p/e ratio is obsolete when it&#39;s not, but he also tries to make an argument that a dental shop is not a low growth industry when it is, very similar to how people say Tesla isn&#39;t a car company and price it differently because of that.</p>\n\n<p>another interesting quote that I found was</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;It was once the job of analysts to tell investors at what price a stock should trade. But now, some analysts say investors are calling the shots, even when it comes to big stocks with predictable earnings growth. Sure, the fine art of rationalizing high stock prices has long been on display for tiny, unproven Internet ventures without earnings.
