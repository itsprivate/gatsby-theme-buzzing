Helping ease the FOMO bug recently. </p>\n\n<p>Been investing for 3 years now, every penny I can into funds for 10 years. </p>\n\n<p>Swayed from funds slightly around May and got super lucky with 50% of my portfolio on a certain stock before a split, which made me think I was leonardo di caprio in that trading film I can’t mention  incase post gets flagged! Jumped on a meme stock, lost 40% of my overall profits in a day! I absolutely know I’m lucky I’m still in the green and thought I’d learned my lesson. </p>\n\n<p>That is until last week where you-know-what stock is blowing up... I don’t know about you but I’m getting massive FOMO and apparently I’m not content on 40% loss on profits...</p>\n\n<p>I’ve just this morning on a white board, written out the same projections I made 3 years ago, “if I save £x amount every month and use 7% as my average interest). And I was more than happy with the results over 10 years. I think I’ll create a more permanent board somewhere with my estimated numbers year on year compared to the actual numbers, to remind myself I’m on track. </p>\n\n<p>Sure more money would be good, but it’s not worth the FOMO. I will have as much as I need sticking to my funds and I can’t really ask for more than that!</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR\nCombat FOMO by reminding yourself why you got into investing, crunch the numbers and see you’ll more than likely still be on track regardless of others profits!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l4nntx/combat_fomo_look_at_original_goals/","title":"Combat FOMO, look at original goals.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-25T18:35:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-25 18:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l4nntx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l4nntx/combat_fomo_look_at_original_goals/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l4nntx/combat_fomo_look_at_original_goals/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"cwhitel","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/cwhitel","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"cwhitel","score":74,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"对抗FOMO，看看最初的目标。","the_new_excerpt":"从一个业余投资者到希望至少有一个其他投资者! 帮助缓解FOMO\n最近的bug。\n\n做投资3年了，10年每一分钱都投入基金。\n\n5月份左右从基金稍微动摇了一下，运气超好，我的50%。\n投资组合在某只股票拆分前，这使得...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對抗FOMO，看看最初的目標。","the_new_excerpt":"從一個業餘投資者到希望至少有一個其他投資者! 幫助緩解FOMO\n最近的bug。\n\n做投資3年了，10年每一分錢都投入基金。\n\n5月份左右從基金稍微動搖了一下，運氣超好，我的50%。\n投資組合在某隻股票拆分前，這使得...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26005457","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26005457","title":"It’s Time for Real Time Settlement","date":"February 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"是时候进行实时结算了","locale":"zh"},{"title":"是時候進行實時結算了","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lauvug","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lauvug/monday_market_opening_attack_explained_how/","title":"MONDAY MARKET OPENING ATTACK EXPLAINED: How institutional investors brought GME down by $5B in 1 hour with $250M","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 03, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"周一市场开盘攻击解读。机构投资者如何用2.5亿美元让GME在1小时内跌去50亿美元？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"週一市場開盤攻擊解讀。機構投資者如何用2.5億美元讓GME在1小時內跌去50億美元？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l4nntx","previousId":"HnPost-26005457","nextId":"RedditPost-lauvug","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l4nntx/combat_fomo_look_at_original_goals/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
