The market is effectively raising intrest rates for the fed in the form of bond yeilds, now the fed normally would implement yeild curve control to bring it under control, however now they can only go to negative intrest rates, and negative interest rates severely affect oil and gas and other comodites, if rates go negative commodity prices will surge and bring on inflation. Now I might be wrong on that and feel free to correct me if I have made any mistakes, but if true the fed is in a really tight spot right now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/llz1sc/everyone_should_be_watching_bond_yeilds/","title":"Everyone should be watching bond yeilds","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-17T19:25:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-17 19:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"llz1sc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/llz1sc/everyone_should_be_watching_bond_yeilds/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/llz1sc/everyone_should_be_watching_bond_yeilds/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ilai_reddead","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ilai_reddead","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ilai_reddead","score":137,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"每个人都应该关注债券行业","the_new_excerpt":"为什么这个市场一直在涨，整个牛市的论点就是股票是\n唯一的游戏，现在的问题是在过去的几个月债券yrilds一直是。\n回升，并且几乎达到了大流行前的水平。市场有效地\n提高美联储的利息率 以债券的形式，现在... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"每個人都應該關注債券行業","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼這個市場一直在漲，整個牛市的論點就是股票是\n唯一的遊戲，現在的問題是在過去的幾個月債券yrilds一直是。\n回升，並且幾乎達到了大流行前的水平。市場有效地\n提高美聯儲的利息率 以債券的形式，現在... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ltpnrj","excerpt":"There is only one answer as to how on Earth 140% shorting was allowed.
