Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR\">more appetite  for risk assets</a>. Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn’t have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn’t have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields.</li>\n<li>This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, <a href=\"https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout\">read this one up.</a> This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher.</li>\n<li>JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something.</li>\n<li>Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that <strong><em>long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously</em></strong> over the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html\">last 20 years(article data till April 29)</a> With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&amp;amp;P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years\">since 2015(dataset ourdated).</a>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.</li>\n<li>As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113\">stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.</a> So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.\n\n<ol>\n<li>Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won&#39;t be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren&#39;t that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don&#39;t go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea either(I think).</li>\n<li>US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently.</li>\n<li>Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won&#39;t normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.\n\n<ol>\n<li>Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm\">and what are the weights of each consumption factors.</a> Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn&#39;t really counter the loss of employment income. Just for clarification, there is lots of asset inflation, for example, bonds are very inflated.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>Using my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:</p>\n\n<p>This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for <strong><em>most</em></strong> stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return(just like Munger said) in this decade, yet I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.</p>\n\n<p><sup>Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don&#39;t listen to a stranger on the internet, please don&#39;t. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.</sup></p>\n\n<p>Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening.</li>\n<li>We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon.</li>\n<li>Black swan events.</li>\n<li>Think of something yourself man!</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lthmxn/why_equities_are_just_in_the_beginning_of_the/","title":"Why equities are just in the beginning of the bull run [Long post]","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-27T08:40:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-27 08:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lthmxn","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lthmxn/why_equities_are_just_in_the_beginning_of_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lthmxn/why_equities_are_just_in_the_beginning_of_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"nafizzaki","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/nafizzaki","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"nafizzaki","score":154,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么说股票只是处于牛市的开始[长文]？","the_new_excerpt":"为wsb写的，但也可以放在这里吧。\n\nTL;DR：这篇文章将尝试提出的论点，股票只是在。\n牛市的开端，并认为你应该投资于股票。\n现在的市场。\n\n\nPREMISE。\n\n股票被抛售，由于上升的国债... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼說股票只是處於牛市的開始[長文]？","the_new_excerpt":"爲wsb寫的，但也可以放在這裏吧。\n\nTL;DR：這篇文章將嘗試提出的論點，股票只是在。\n牛市的開端，並認爲你應該投資於股票。\n現在的市場。\n\n\nPREMISE。\n\n股票被拋售，由於上升的國債... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m14jye","excerpt":"Get your tinfoil hat out , its time to see what you think you want to see but\ndon't really want to.
