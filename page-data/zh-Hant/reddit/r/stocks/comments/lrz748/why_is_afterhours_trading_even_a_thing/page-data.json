Why not restrict the trading between 08-16 or just allow everyone to purchase/sell during after hours? I live in Sweden so I invest through something called an &quot;Investeringssparkonto&quot; which you tax like 0,375% on the total value of the account and instead of 30% of the profits and we can&#39;t trade during AH with those accounts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lrz748/why_is_afterhours_trading_even_a_thing/","title":"Why is afterhours trading even a thing?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-25T11:22:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-25 11:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lrz748","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrz748/why_is_afterhours_trading_even_a_thing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrz748/why_is_afterhours_trading_even_a_thing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"pm_me_you_in_latex","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/pm_me_you_in_latex","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"pm_me_you_in_latex","score":248,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么盘后交易还能成事？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，我是新的投资生活，我只是一直在想，为什么收市后的\n交易甚至是一个东西？大多数普通投资者并没有能力来\n交易后的时间，所以我们只是坐在那里，看股票上涨或下跌和\n无力做任何事情，而机构和富人... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼盤後交易還能成事？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，我是新的投資生活，我只是一直在想，爲什麼收市後的\n交易甚至是一個東西？大多數普通投資者並沒有能力來\n交易後的時間，所以我們只是坐在那裏，看股票上漲或下跌和\n無力做任何事情，而機構和富人... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26362492","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26362492","title":"Why is electricity so hard to understand?
