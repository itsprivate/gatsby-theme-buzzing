I’ve had some education in the bio realm and have read up on crispr since years ago so this is exciting stuff. I definitely want to invest and am now just trying to choose which route I want to choose. Usually I am opposed to ETFs and would rather just go with individual stocks as I don’t worry too much about the risk. However the ARKG etf does have a very attractive array of genomics/biotech companies. On the other hand I do feel good on hopping on Intellia or Crispr and riding out the next couple years as well.
