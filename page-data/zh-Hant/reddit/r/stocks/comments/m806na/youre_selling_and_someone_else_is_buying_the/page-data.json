Then the next day or two or week everything reverses!</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s like musical chairs or something.  What the hecks the point?!  Also what makes it really stupid is that when someone is selling because of bad news someone else is buying the same bad news!</p>\n\n<p>So people are selling because they think BECAUSE of bad news their stocks will go down and so consequently those same sellers are all driving the price down by selling!  Makes a lot of sense! </p>\n\n<p>So everyone panics and sells because they think everyone else is going to panic and sell and so everyone sells.  </p>\n\n<p>And the funniest part is that a few days later everyone buys right back in again!
