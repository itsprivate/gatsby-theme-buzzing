That company has been considering selling some of its shares in its IPO directly to its own users, Bloomberg News reported. Such a move would be striking because retail investors usually don’t get to buy into new listings at the offering price. Instead, they typically have to invest on the first day of trading in a rush that can drive up the stock price.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/robinhood-to-plan-confidential-ipo-filing-as-soon-as-march/articleshow/81239789.cms\">https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/robinhood-to-plan-confidential-ipo-filing-as-soon-as-march/articleshow/81239789.cms</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lth29r/robinhood_to_plan_confidential_ipo_filing_as_soon/","title":"Robinhood to plan confidential IPO filing as soon as March","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-27T14:33:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-27 14:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lth29r","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lth29r/robinhood_to_plan_confidential_ipo_filing_as_soon/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lth29r/robinhood_to_plan_confidential_ipo_filing_as_soon/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ExcellentNoThankYou","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ExcellentNoThankYou","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ExcellentNoThankYou","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Robinhood计划最快3月秘密提交IPO申请。","the_new_excerpt":"Robinhood Markets Inc.\nGameStop公司的股票，计划秘密申请首次公开发行。\n据知情人士透露，最快将于3月发行。\n\n该公司在过去一周与承销商举行了有关...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Robinhood計劃最快3月祕密提交IPO申請。","the_new_excerpt":"Robinhood Markets Inc.\nGameStop公司的股票，計劃祕密申請首次公開發行。\n據知情人士透露，最快將於3月發行。\n\n該公司在過去一週與承銷商舉行了有關...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26283650","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26283650","title":"Are You Trading or Gambling?","date":"February 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"你是交易还是赌博？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你是交易還是賭博？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ltjkqd","excerpt":"Late night news that the house passed the stimulus bill.
