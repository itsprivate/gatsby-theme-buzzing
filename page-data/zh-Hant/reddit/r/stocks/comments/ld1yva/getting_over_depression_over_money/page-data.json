I discovered something about myself and I wanted to share. I just started investing last year and dabbled in this and that. Made couple thousand in NIO and TSLA rise but nothing to write home about.</p>\n\n<p>I went in on GME with my life savings at around $44, and was up about 500k. I fell victim to the moving goalpost and didn&#39;t sell. I sold while it was crashing and netted about 90k profits. I have no reason to complain and I learned so many valuable lessons. The nature of man&#39;s greed, the importance to locking in profits, not counting chickens before they hatch, etc. I got lost in my vision of what I could do with that money, not when it was at 460 but at 1000 etc.</p>\n\n<p>Two weeks ago if someone told me that I was going to make about 85k post tax plus my initial investment back, I would have jumped for joy. But I&#39;m going through depression that I missed out on the 500k and I wake up from sleeping with flashing pangs of regret. I know it&#39;s just the start of my lifelong investment career, and I&#39;ll have more opportunities. Pain is all relative. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, money is so easy to make. Other times, it&#39;s the hardest thing to accumulate.</p>\n\n<p>Always be happy with your profits, green is green, take home what you can while you can.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ld1yva/getting_over_depression_over_money/","title":"Getting over depression over money","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T13:32:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 13:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ld1yva","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ld1yva/getting_over_depression_over_money/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ld1yva/getting_over_depression_over_money/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"republicj","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/republicj","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"republicj","score":115,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"摆脱对金钱的忧郁","the_new_excerpt":"我没有权利抱怨，我也不是在寻求同情。I\n发现了一些关于自己的东西，我想分享。我刚刚开始\n去年投资，涉足了这个那个。赚了几千块钱的NIO\n和TSLA的上涨，但没有什么好写的。\n\n我在GME上用我的生命... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"擺脫對金錢的憂鬱","the_new_excerpt":"我沒有權利抱怨，我也不是在尋求同情。I\n發現了一些關於自己的東西，我想分享。我剛剛開始\n去年投資，涉足了這個那個。賺了幾千塊錢的NIO\n和TSLA的上漲，但沒有什麼好寫的。\n\n我在GME上用我的生命... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ljsu04","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljsu04/can_anyone_guess_when_i_discovered_options_trading/","title":"Can anyone guess when I discovered options trading?","date":"February 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"谁能猜猜我是什么时候发现期权交易的？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"誰能猜猜我是什麼時候發現期權交易的？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ljgtxj","excerpt":"So, the day has come, and MicroVision's market cap is finally big enough so that\nyou won't get banned for mentioning it on WSB.
