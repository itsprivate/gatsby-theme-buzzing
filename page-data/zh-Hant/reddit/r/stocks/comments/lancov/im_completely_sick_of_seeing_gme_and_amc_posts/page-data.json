So I really hope to start seeing some DD posts about new companies or existing ones with potentially bright futures. </p>\n\n<p>I was in amc at 2.41 a week before they took off fully having researched and believing theatres will make a comeback and that that share price was an absolute steal. I was rewarded for this but only by luck, not by AMC themselves. Luckily I’m able to distinguish that and not consider this pure luck as me being some expert investor in my first week of investing</p>\n\n<p>Right now I’m in sundial. It’s a penny, high risk high reward stock. The ceo is making headway toward profitability and that’s really all we can ask for, a ceo who is willing to do whatever it takes to succeed= good odds of success in my eyes. All anyone can do is try, sundial is up today in a good way. Hoping to see more good results tomorrow</p>\n\n<p>Just saying though, like the people constantly bombarding with GME posts are seeing a lot of fucking new income, getting high off it and are now just as fucking greedy as wallstreet folks.. like lol. It was never about taking on the big guys. If it was, it was only like the first few days of it now it’s just greedy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lancov/im_completely_sick_of_seeing_gme_and_amc_posts/","title":"I’m completely sick of seeing GME and AMC posts","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T07:02:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 07:02","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lancov","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lancov/im_completely_sick_of_seeing_gme_and_amc_posts/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lancov/im_completely_sick_of_seeing_gme_and_amc_posts/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"TheTargaryen28","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTargaryen28","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"TheTargaryen28","score":604,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我完全厌倦了看到GME和AMC的帖子","the_new_excerpt":"我对市场上的其他股票基本上都比较感兴趣，在\n这一点。所以我真的希望开始看到一些关于新公司的DD帖子\n或现有的与潜在的光明的未来。\n\n我在AMC在2.41一个星期前，他们完全起飞研究和\n相信...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我完全厭倦了看到GME和AMC的帖子","the_new_excerpt":"我對市場上的其他股票基本上都比較感興趣，在\n這一點。所以我真的希望開始看到一些關於新公司的DD帖子\n或現有的與潛在的光明的未來。\n\n我在AMC在2.41一個星期前，他們完全起飛研究和\n相信...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lgsx6w","excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-lawsuit-nyse-nasdaq-idUSKBN2AA09P\n\n(Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc and the New York Stock Exchange have each sued the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, seeking to block a plan by the regulator to\noverhaul public data feeds that broadcast stock prices to investors,…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lgsx6w/reuters_nasdaq_new_york_stock_exchange_sue_sec/","title":"Reuters: “Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange sue SEC over planned overhaul of public data feeds”","date":"February 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"路透社，\"纳斯达克、纽约证券交易所起诉美国证券交易委员会 \"纳斯达克，纽约证券交易所起诉美国证券交易委员会 计划对公共数据源进行全面改革\"","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-lawsuit-nyse-nasdaq-idUSKBN2AA09P\n\n(路透社)--纳斯达克公司和纽约证券交易所已分别起诉。\n证券交易委员会，寻求阻止监管机构的一项计划。\n彻底改革向投资者播报股价的公共数据源，... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"路透社，\"納斯達克、紐約證券交易所起訴美國證券交易委員會 \"納斯達克，紐約證券交易所起訴美國證券交易委員會 計劃對公共數據源進行全面改革\"","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-lawsuit-nyse-nasdaq-idUSKBN2AA09P\n\n(路透社)--納斯達克公司和紐約證券交易所已分別起訴。\n證券交易委員會，尋求阻止監管機構的一項計劃。\n徹底改革向投資者播報股價的公共數據源，... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lgntg0","excerpt":"Everyone is talking about the 78.46% short interest, but there's another metric\nthat Finra released tonight that's extremely interesting:\n\nInstitutional ownership is now at a whopping 205.96%, a net increase of\n20,525,480 shares from last report.\n\nSource\n[http://finra…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgntg0/institutional_ownership_of_gme_at_20596/","title":"Institutional ownership of GME at 205.96%","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 10, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME的机构所有权为205.96%。","the_new_excerpt":"大家都在说78.46%的空头，但还有另一个指标\nFinra今晚公布的数据非常有趣。\n\n机构持股比例高达205.96%，净增加了...\n距离上次报告的20,525,480股。\n\n资料来源\n[http://finra...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME的機構所有權爲205.96%。","the_new_excerpt":"大家都在說78.46%的空頭，但還有另一個指標\nFinra今晚公佈的數據非常有趣。\n\n機構持股比例高達205.96%，淨增加了...\n距離上次報告的20,525,480股。\n\n資料來源\n[http://finra...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lancov","previousId":"RedditPost-lgsx6w","nextId":"RedditPost-lgntg0","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lancov/im_completely_sick_of_seeing_gme_and_amc_posts/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
