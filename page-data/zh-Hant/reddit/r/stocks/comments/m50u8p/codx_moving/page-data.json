Totally undervalued. It closed after hours at $14 and WSJ has its price target at $43! Dropped with the market from over $20 a few weeks ago, finally began moving again and started squeezing out the shorts this week after they announced a partnership with Walgreens for their new patented rapid-covid saliva tests. </p>\n\n<p>Also- $CODX has earnings in a few weeks and it’s from the best quarter ever thanks to the sales of the other covid tests they sell. Shorts are beginning to cover which shot it up 20% from last weeks opening price. Last I saw though about 90% of shorts still haven’t covered yet. </p>\n\n<p>Earnings is estimated the last week of March so I purchased about 75 of the 4/16 $30 calls for about $.70, crazy how cheap they are! Also picked up a few $29 and $30 calls for 3/19 for fun on Friday, paid $.10. All on top of my 175 shares. </p>\n\n<p>Definitely check it out! I’ve been holding my 175 shares since $8 in January and I’m not selling till at least $40!</p>\n\n<p>Per usual I am not a financial advisor so do with this as you wish 😇</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m50u8p/codx_moving/","title":"$CODX moving ⬆️!","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-14T19:29:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-14 19:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m50u8p","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m50u8p/codx_moving/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m50u8p/codx_moving/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Scared_Patience_4802","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Scared_Patience_4802","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Scared_Patience_4802","score":146,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$CODX搬家 ⬆️!","the_new_excerpt":"$CODX仍然是一个隐藏的宝石! 完全被低估了。盘后收盘价14美元\n而《华尔街日报》将其目标价定为43美元! 随着市场的下跌，从20多美元几\n周前，终于又开始活动了，开始挤出短裤，这。\n在他们宣布与Walgreens合作后的一周内，... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$CODX搬家 ⬆️!","the_new_excerpt":"$CODX仍然是一個隱藏的寶石! 完全被低估了。盤後收盤價14美元\n而《華爾街日報》將其目標價定爲43美元! 隨着市場的下跌，從20多美元幾\n周前，終於又開始活動了，開始擠出短褲，這。\n在他們宣佈與Walgreens合作後的一週內，... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m4vzcr","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4vzcr/dian_fossey_gorilla_fund_has_updated_their/","title":"Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund has updated their frontpage with \"APES STRONG TOGETHER\". 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍","date":"March 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Dian Fossey大猩猩基金在头版更新了 \"APES STRONG TOGETHER\"。🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Dian Fossey大猩猩基金在頭版更新了 \"APES STRONG TOGETHER\"。🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m4qeyd","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4qeyd/every_time_ape_get_adopted_on_this_sub/","title":"Every time ape get adopted on this sub","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 14, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"每次猩猩在这个次元被收养的时候","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"每次猩猩在這個次元被收養的時候","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m50u8p","previousId":"RedditPost-m4vzcr","nextId":"RedditPost-m4qeyd","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m50u8p/codx_moving/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
