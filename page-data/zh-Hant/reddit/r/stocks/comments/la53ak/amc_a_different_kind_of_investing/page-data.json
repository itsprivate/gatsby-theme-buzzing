I grew up going to movie theaters with friends, and I think it holds sentimental value with plenty of you as well. It’s one thing for a company to fail due to bad business, and it&#39;s another for it to fail due to a random, unexpected, unpreventable pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>These last few weeks have taught the retail investor, and everyone, a valuable lesson. It was really only a matter of time until something like this occurred: that the internet would form a substantial community of ongoing communication large enough to eventually take on larger financial institutions. The retail investor has never had this much buying power ever before, and because of the nature of the internet, I see that as being unlikely to change. Thus the stock market has become, and will become, more reflective of a democracy. Middle class individuals, when working together, have the power to make the changes we want to see in the stock market. We can save the companies we want to save.</p>\n\n<p>Now, none of this is to say that fundamentals don&#39;t matter. Fundamentals matter. But, not only do fundamentals affect stock prices, but stock prices (can) affect fundamentals. A projected growth for a corporation can be self fulfilling. An increasing stock price (which has been suppressed by short sellers), can open many new opportunities for AMC and truly be a game changer for their business.</p>\n\n<p>America’s entertainment industry is the largest in the world and an integral piece of our economy. Do we the people want to allow movie theaters to become a thing of the past? I don&#39;t. And with a Democratic Spirit, I will vote with my money for a future I&#39;d like to see.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on this. Of course, this strategy, of creating value vs finding value, is not for every investor. But I think there is a paradigm shift occurring, where there is a new possibility of helping companies we like. Feel free to disagree with any of this, I&#39;d just like to hear your thoughts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/la53ak/amc_a_different_kind_of_investing/","title":"AMC: A Different Kind of Investing","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-01T20:59:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-01 20:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"la53ak","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/la53ak/amc_a_different_kind_of_investing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/la53ak/amc_a_different_kind_of_investing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"LongLiveTheCrown","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LongLiveTheCrown","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"LongLiveTheCrown","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"AMC。不同的投资方式","the_new_excerpt":"AMC对我来说有感情价值。我从小到大都是和\n朋友们，我想这对你们很多人也有感情价值。它的\n一家公司因经营不善而倒闭是一回事，而它是另一回事。\n由于随机的、意外的、不可预防的大流行病而失败。\n\n这些...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"AMC。不同的投資方式","the_new_excerpt":"AMC對我來說有感情價值。我從小到大都是和\n朋友們，我想這對你們很多人也有感情價值。它的\n一家公司因經營不善而倒閉是一回事，而它是另一回事。\n由於隨機的、意外的、不可預防的大流行病而失敗。\n\n這些...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lghb3w","excerpt":"So they have a new product coming out, I think its just called 10x. its an\nannual subscription service for $1,299 (lets see how well that'll sell lol)\nwhich they will release 40 companies that they think have potential to reach 10x\nvaluation from where they are today.\n\nI got about 10 different…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lghb3w/i_watch_motley_fools_new_program_offering_video/","title":"I watch Motley Fools new program offering video today","date":"February 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我看Motley Fools的新程序提供的视频今天。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，他们有一个新的产品出来，我认为它只是叫10倍。\n年费服务1299元（看看卖得怎么样吧\n他们将发布40家他们认为有潜力达到10倍的公司。\n估值从他们今天的位置。\n\n我有大约10个不同的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我看Motley Fools的新程序提供的視頻今天。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，他們有一個新的產品出來，我認爲它只是叫10倍。\n年費服務1299元（看看賣得怎麼樣吧\n他們將發佈40家他們認爲有潛力達到10倍的公司。\n估值從他們今天的位置。\n\n我有大約10個不同的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lgeo3w","excerpt":"First post, so please direct me if I do things wrong.\n\nFarmer's Edge Inc just filed for Initial public offering\n(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-09/farmers-edge-files-papers-for-initial-public-offering-in-canada)\n\nFarmers Edge employs technology to collect and analyze local weather,…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lgeo3w/artificial_intelligence_meets_agriculture_ipo/","title":"Artificial intelligence meets agriculture, IPO","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 10, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"人工智能遇上农业，IPO","the_new_excerpt":"第一次发帖，如果我做错了，请指教。\n\n农夫缘公司刚刚提交了首次公开募股申请。\n(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-09/farmers-edge-files-papers-for-initial-public-offering-in-canada)\n\nFarmers Edge采用技术收集和分析当地天气、...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"人工智能遇上農業，IPO","the_new_excerpt":"第一次發帖，如果我做錯了，請指教。\n\n農夫緣公司剛剛提交了首次公開募股申請。\n(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-09/farmers-edge-files-papers-for-initial-public-offering-in-canada)\n\nFarmers Edge採用技術收集和分析當地天氣、...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-la53ak","previousId":"RedditPost-lghb3w","nextId":"RedditPost-lgeo3w","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/la53ak/amc_a_different_kind_of_investing/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
