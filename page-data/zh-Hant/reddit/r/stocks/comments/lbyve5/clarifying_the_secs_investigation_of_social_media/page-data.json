Then they would try to match up those trades with posts on social media, while sorting out who wrote the posts and what their intent was, he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> the SEC isn&#39;t going after everyone on WSB - in fact, they&#39;re not even saying they&#39;re going after anyone on WSB.  If they do, <strong>it&#39;s going to be the professional traders</strong> that went in and started <strong>giving misinformation</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>attempted to manipulate the subreddit for their gain</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please don&#39;t buy into tweets or brief headlines that claim</strong> the SEC is hunting down Redditors and not looking into brokerage apps and hedge funds - they&#39;re looking at all angles, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll bring to justice the people who manipulated the masses - do some DD for yourself and spend the two minutes it takes to read articles in their entirety.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lbyve5/clarifying_the_secs_investigation_of_social_media/","title":"Clarifying the SEC's Investigation of Social Media GME Hype for Fraud [Bloomberg Article]","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-04T01:57:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-04 01:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lbyve5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbyve5/clarifying_the_secs_investigation_of_social_media/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbyve5/clarifying_the_secs_investigation_of_social_media/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"chirish_b","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/chirish_b","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"chirish_b","score":150,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"澄清SEC对社交媒体GME炒作欺诈的调查【彭博社文章】。","the_new_excerpt":"下面是文章的链接。\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/sec-hunts-for-fraud-in-social-media-posts-that-drove-up-gamestop\n\n而且，这里是很多读者一直忽略的最重要的一点。\n\n> 主流的说法是华尔街的卖空者被抓了个现行\n>…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"澄清SEC對社交媒體GME炒作欺詐的調查【彭博社文章】。","the_new_excerpt":"下面是文章的鏈接。\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/sec-hunts-for-fraud-in-social-media-posts-that-drove-up-gamestop\n\n而且，這裏是很多讀者一直忽略的最重要的一點。\n\n> 主流的說法是華爾街的賣空者被抓了個現行\n>…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26103533","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26103533","title":"Tesla Recalls Cars with EMMC Failures, Calls Part a ‘Wear Item’","date":"February 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"特斯拉召回EMMC故障汽车，称零件为 \"磨损品","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉召回EMMC故障汽車，稱零件爲 \"磨損品","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-li4uaz","excerpt":"That title is worse than it sounds.
