So far my portfolio is up about 5 percent, however recently there have been 2 opportunities where I could have sold a stock at a much higher price after it went up insane amounts in 1 day. </p>\n\n<p>These particular instances were $RKT (owned shares at 20.90) which went up to 43$ and $CHEK (owned shares at 1.70) which went up 180 percent in 1 day from 1.53$ to 4.30$. I didn&#39;t sell my shares in either of these instances (let&#39;s be honest I got greedy) and both have significantly dropped since (still up on both positions). </p>\n\n<p>My question is how do you guys deal with situations like this? When do you take profits? If I had sold off my shares in both instances I could have been up about 20 percent in total. I am aware thinking why didn&#39;t I get out at the top in hindsight is a toxic mindset but I am looking to improve my abilities as an investor so therefore I am here asking you kind people for advice. Thanks in advance :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m6mcro/tips_for_helping_when_to_sell_a_stock/","title":"Tips for helping when to sell a stock.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T13:53:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 13:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m6mcro","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6mcro/tips_for_helping_when_to_sell_a_stock/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6mcro/tips_for_helping_when_to_sell_a_stock/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"alttoby","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/alttoby","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"alttoby","score":44,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"帮助何时卖出股票的技巧。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我最近开始投资（一直积极关注市场）。\n自8月以来，在事后看来，坐在一旁的时间太长了。\n12月底开始）。) 到目前为止，我的投资组合上涨了5%左右，然而。\n最近有2次机会，我本来可以卖掉...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"幫助何時賣出股票的技巧。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我最近開始投資（一直積極關注市場）。\n自8月以來，在事後看來，坐在一旁的時間太長了。\n12月底開始）。) 到目前爲止，我的投資組合上漲了5%左右，然而。\n最近有2次機會，我本來可以賣掉...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1372159590205374466","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1372159590205374466","title":"US SPACs, IPO capital raised...\n2013: $1 billion\n2014: $2 billion\n2015: $4 billion\n2016: $3 billion\n2017: $11 billion\n2018: $9 billion\n2019: $13 billion\n2020: $83 billion\n2021 YTD: $85 billion","date":"March 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国SPACs，IPO募集资金...\n2013年：10亿美元\n2014年：20亿美元\n2015年：40亿美元\n2016年：30亿美元\n2017年：110亿美元\n2018年：90亿美元\n2019年：130亿美元\n2020年：830亿美元\n2021 YTD：850亿美元","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國SPACs，IPO募集資金...\n2013年：10億美元\n2014年：20億美元\n2015年：40億美元\n2016年：30億美元\n2017年：110億美元\n2018年：90億美元\n2019年：130億美元\n2020年：830億美元\n2021 YTD：850億美元","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26488655","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26488655","title":"Tusky has been removed from the Play Store","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 17, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Tusky已从Play Store中移除。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Tusky已從Play Store中移除。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m6mcro","previousId":"TweetPost-1372159590205374466","nextId":"HnPost-26488655","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m6mcro/tips_for_helping_when_to_sell_a_stock/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
