But for better or worse, it&#39;s still tied to the BANG gang.</p>\n\n<p>Tread carefully. If you believe in the $BB thesis, and are confident in your ability to time the markets, there&#39;s obviously an optimal play where you time the top, sell, and buy a dip as $BB continues along its long term march. It&#39;s hard to argue that today (and likely tomorrow&#39;s) rise is due to fundamentals.</p>\n\n<h1>However - It&#39;s even harder to argue that GME&#39;s rise today was because they fired their CFO. Point being - Timing the top is difficult (and much more so than seeing a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/\">fundamenta</a>l investment thesis based on $BB&#39;s business reality).</h1>\n\n<h1>My price target is <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/\">$60 USD / share</a>, in some reasonable time frame (this year or early next) as $BB shows traction through a couple quarters of earnings.BUT - This is a crazy market. All I can say is paraphrase what somebody wise and rich once said to me - if you&#39;re an investor, think in terms of years. If you&#39;re a trader - best of luck.</h1>\n\n<p>Disclaimer - Just a fool. But sometimes the biggest fool gets all the bananas.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lrpta4/thoughts_on_bb_and_memes_22421/","title":"Thoughts on $BB and Memes - 2-24-21","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-25T02:05:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-25 02:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lrpta4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrpta4/thoughts_on_bb_and_memes_22421/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrpta4/thoughts_on_bb_and_memes_22421/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"growthinvestor123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/growthinvestor123","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"growthinvestor123","score":136,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"对$BB和Memes的看法 - 2-24-21","the_new_excerpt":"你们很多人都知道，我们一直在祈祷脱钩。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb4e2m/part_3_bb_dd_no_meems_fuck_the_memes/]\n因此，$BB可以继续沿着其缓慢、稳定的路径，（a）基本业务\n转型，以及（二）投资者意识作为人...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對$BB和Memes的看法 - 2-24-21","the_new_excerpt":"你們很多人都知道，我們一直在祈禱脫鉤。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb4e2m/part_3_bb_dd_no_meems_fuck_the_memes/]\n因此，$BB可以繼續沿着其緩慢、穩定的路徑，（a）基本業務\n轉型，以及（二）投資者意識作爲人...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lzbnwu","excerpt":"I came into the stock market about 2 months ago.
