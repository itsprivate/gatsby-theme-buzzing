The ultimate aim is to ensure that virtually every product the company sells is a van ride—and eventually a drone flight—away from customers’ homes. And yet, last week Amazon announced it was buying 11 Boeing 767-300 jets for its air-cargo division, mostly to get products to Prime subscribers.</p>\n\n<p>The expanded air-cargo operation will add billions of dollars to already hefty shipping costs that amounted to $52 billion in the 12 months ended in September. Though Amazon is one of the wealthiest and most valuable companies in the world, it has historically operated on razor-thin margins and plowed cash back into the business, sometimes to the consternation of investors who’d rather see the company focus on profitability.</p>\n\n<p>Even as Amazon expands its air-cargo division, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos remains fixated on his ultimate dream: building a network so sophisticated it can get just about anything to a customer’s doorstep in 30 minutes or less. One day his vision will bring another air carrier to life, the Prime Now drone fleet, that along with autonomous vehicles and electric vans could make it less necessary to fly stuffed giraffes across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the award.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxxp97/amazon_keeps_buying_pricey_jets_after_promising_a/","title":"Amazon Keeps Buying Pricey Jets After Promising a Drone Fleet","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-16T00:04:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-16 00:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kxxp97","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxxp97/amazon_keeps_buying_pricey_jets_after_promising_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxxp97/amazon_keeps_buying_pricey_jets_after_promising_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"coolcomfort123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/coolcomfort123","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"coolcomfort123","score":64,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"亚马逊在承诺建立无人机舰队后，继续购买昂贵的喷气式飞机。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/amazon-prime-overnight-shipping-guarantees-rely-on-fleet-of-pricey-jets?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google\n\n亚马逊公司在美国开设仓库和航运中心的速度。\n大约每24小时一个。最终目的是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"亞馬遜在承諾建立無人機艦隊後，繼續購買昂貴的噴氣式飛機。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/amazon-prime-overnight-shipping-guarantees-rely-on-fleet-of-pricey-jets?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google\n\n亞馬遜公司在美國開設倉庫和航運中心的速度。\n大約每24小時一個。最終目的是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kxwxds","excerpt":"I'm starting to sink my teeth into Active Trader Pro, but I can't get around the\nfact that it's UI just feels a little clunky compared to what else is out there.\n\nRight now I'm comparing Active Trader Pro with Tradingview for the purposes of\nresearching and understanding my stocks.\n\nQuestion is:…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kxwxds/for_those_that_use_fidelity_is_active_trader_pro/","title":"For those that use Fidelity: is Active Trader Pro worth the learning curve, or is it better to do your research on websites with more modern, clean UIs (ex. tradingview) ?","date":"January 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"对于那些使用Fidelity的人：Active Trader Pro是否值得学习，还是最好在更现代、更干净的用户界面的网站上做研究（如tradingview）？","the_new_excerpt":"我开始对Active Trader Pro感兴趣，但我无法绕过这个问题。\n事实上，它的用户界面和其他的软件相比，感觉有点笨拙。\n\n现在我正在比较Active Trader Pro和Tradingview，目的在于\n研究和了解我的股票。\n\n问题是：...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對於那些使用Fidelity的人：Active Trader Pro是否值得學習，還是最好在更現代、更乾淨的用戶界面的網站上做研究（如tradingview）？","the_new_excerpt":"我開始對Active Trader Pro感興趣，但我無法繞過這個問題。\n事實上，它的用戶界面和其他的軟件相比，感覺有點笨拙。\n\n現在我正在比較Active Trader Pro和Tradingview，目的在於\n研究和了解我的股票。\n\n問題是：...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-25795731","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25795731","title":"Escaping VirtualBox 6.1: Part 1","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 16, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Escaping VirtualBox 6.1: 第一部分","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Escaping VirtualBox 6.1: 第一部分","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kxxp97","previousId":"RedditPost-kxwxds","nextId":"HnPost-25795731","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxxp97/amazon_keeps_buying_pricey_jets_after_promising_a/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
