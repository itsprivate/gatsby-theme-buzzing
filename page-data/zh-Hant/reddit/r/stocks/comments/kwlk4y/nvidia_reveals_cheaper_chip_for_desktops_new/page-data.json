Nvidia said that more than 70 laptop manufacturers would offer gaming laptops that use the company’s next-generation Ampere architecture. Nvidia said its new gaming laptops would be priced at $999 for the RTX 3060 model, $1,299 for the RTX 3070 model, and $1,999 for the RTX 3080 model.</p>\n\n<p>As many gamers found this past holiday season, however, those list prices were pretty much meaningless as resellers scooped up available RTX 30-series cards and sold them at much higher prices, and remaining 30-series cards were only available from manufacturers who were bundling the cards into pre-made gaming rigs. Supply problems were so bad, especially as many new games that required fast hardware were released, that even Nvidia’s older 20-series generation of cards saw significant markups from resellers.</p>\n\n<p>This new product launch, however, should be a little easier given that laptop chips make better use of constrained foundry resources, Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, told MarketWatch in an interview.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kwlk4y/nvidia_reveals_cheaper_chip_for_desktops_new/","title":"Nvidia reveals cheaper chip for desktops, new gaming laptops that could avoid supply crunch","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-13T23:08:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-13 23:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kwlk4y","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kwlk4y/nvidia_reveals_cheaper_chip_for_desktops_new/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kwlk4y/nvidia_reveals_cheaper_chip_for_desktops_new/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"coolcomfort123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/coolcomfort123","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"coolcomfort123","score":93,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Nvidia透露台式机更便宜的芯片，新游戏笔记本可避免供应紧张","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-reveals-cheaper-chip-for-desktops-new-gaming-laptops-that-could-avoid-supply-crunch-11610472725\n\n周二，Nvidia表示将推出一款更便宜的台式机。\n显卡，RTX 3060--没有 \"Ti \"的称号--329美元，在。\n除了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Nvidia透露臺式機更便宜的芯片，新遊戲筆記本可避免供應緊張","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-reveals-cheaper-chip-for-desktops-new-gaming-laptops-that-could-avoid-supply-crunch-11610472725\n\n週二，Nvidia表示將推出一款更便宜的臺式機。\n顯卡，RTX 3060--沒有 \"Ti \"的稱號--329美元，在。\n除了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kwpxbt","excerpt":"Few days ago, I posted about a google sheets u/HappyAnsu [/u/HappyAnsu] and I\nmade, to get a better overview of the holdings in the individual ARK ETF's,\ntogether with other data.
