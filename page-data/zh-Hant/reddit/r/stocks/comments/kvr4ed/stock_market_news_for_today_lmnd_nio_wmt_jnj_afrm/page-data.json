Lemonade has a wild ride, while NIO shines again. Is JNJ the best vaccine play? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>~Long Post~</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hello everyone and Good morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market giving up some of the last week gains, with the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/XXF9JHS\">Nasdaq Composite</a> losing 1.25%, the broad stock market <a href=\"https://ibb.co/HGrtWgk\">SP500</a> losing 0.66% and the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/1z21KR2\">Dow Jones Industrial</a> finishing down almost 90 points as we also saw the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/fqwvn71\">VIX</a> spiking again by more than 11%, thought it was even higher at the start of the day.</p>\n\n<p>We saw more companies declining <a href=\"https://ibb.co/8sr5bqw\">YESTERDAY</a>, but only saw 8 new lows, while the number of companies moving above the moving averages is still very high. We also saw only 3 of the 11 <a href=\"https://ibb.co/HgZTxtj\">SECTORS</a> finish the day in the green, with Energy in the lead, while Materials finished flat and Real Estate, Communications and Consumer Discretionary were the biggest losers dropping more than 1% as we saw mostly large-cap growth companies losing ground, with small &amp; mid-caps outperforming yet again, continuing the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/8x5m4cc\">TREND</a> that can also be seen from the start of 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/m9Jb0sS\">HEAT MAP</a> from yesterday, you can see almost all big tech companies lost ground, with Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix losing more than 2% while Tesla also lost almost 8% after an 11day winning streak. The biggest gains were made in the semiconductors &amp; drug manufacturers.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ibb.co/Xp3hvr0\">Today</a> we get don’t get that much economic data, as we wait for more heavy days starting tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>In some other stock market news, we saw <a href=\"https://ibb.co/K7YV26k\">LEMONADE</a> take quite a ride again yesterday, going from barely down for the day, up to a huge gain of 14%, after the COO of the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/9cCz2XD\">COMPANY</a> went on Twitter and attacked the Seeking Alpha bearish articles on the company, only to later in after hours to announce they will <a href=\"https://ibb.co/hYqJJHZ\">SELL</a> shares again for corporate purposes. This is further testimony to the point I have been making in the past weeks, that companies are very incentivized to sell stock to raise capital or even for the management of the company to realize some gains. I really like Lemonade and will hold them for the long-term, but after a 200% increase in the past couple of <a href=\"https://ibb.co/Dp1csg0\">MONTHS</a>, I trimmed my positions in the company by selling out the cost basis and letting the profits run, though I might add to this position if a significant pullback or correction appears.</p>\n\n<p>Moving on, we also saw <a href=\"https://ibb.co/pL18LYP\">WALMART</a> being the latest company that is planning to make a pus in the fintech world. This is really nice news to hear from the company, as they try to diversify their revenue stream even more, while they are also trying to compete more &amp; more with Amazon in the online retail business.</p>\n\n<p>In the hardware technology <a href=\"https://ibb.co/b6S6yKn\">SECTOR</a>, we saw Apple gaining some market share of the global PC shipments which has seen an overall 13% increase in 2020, the biggest such spike since 2010. I think Apple has room to grow this market share even more with the continuing improvements and adopting of their latest in-house chips.</p>\n\n<p>We also saw some developments in the health care world, with JNJ’s vaccine <a href=\"https://ibb.co/LC4Qsgp\">EXPECTED</a> to deliver results by the end of the month, keep in mind this is my favorite vaccine play, with their vaccine only needing 1 shot and not requiring such extreme storage conditions like the Pfizer &amp; Moderna ones, while also being expected to have better results than AstraZeneca’s vaccine.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Eli <a href=\"https://ibb.co/Y8t0gm2\">Lilly</a> delivered some promising results on their Alzheimer’s study, which led the stock to have a big pop yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>And in the IPO world we will have <a href=\"https://ibb.co/tbdgmjP\">AFFIRM</a> Holdings on the deck, as we found out that the fintech Affirm will start its IPO price from at least $41, but it’s really hard to believe shares will reach the market for retail traders under $60-$70.</p>\n\n<p>And one last piece of news, exactly like I told you yesterday, <a href=\"https://ibb.co/Wv8nRpy\">NIO</a> opened higher on the huge hype after the NIO Day, almost touching 67$ before dropping to under 63$ to finish the day, only to <a href=\"https://ibb.co/dpzHh7Q\">DROP</a> even more after hours, before recovering today in pre-market. It’s a wild ride with this company. I see some short-term downside, but long-term upside for this company.</p>\n\n<p>So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as I think there is a significant possibility that with this new stimulus checks, we might see another increase in stock trading from people who are receiving these checks. Last <a href=\"https://ibb.co/sFWcyRp\">TIME</a> around securities trading was one of the top ways that money was used in most of the income brackets. Today the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/FBxg7s8\">WORLD</a> Markets are pretty flat and the US <a href=\"https://ibb.co/s22g9Pb\">FUTURES</a> are mixed, with the Dow slightly down, while the Nasdaq is leading the way.</p>\n\n<p>🙏Thank you everyone for reading!🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content!
