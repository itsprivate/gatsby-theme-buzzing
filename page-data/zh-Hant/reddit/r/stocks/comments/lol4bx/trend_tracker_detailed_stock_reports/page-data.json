This is done using an algorithm measuring the mentions of a particular stock across social media. There is also an algorithm to decide the general sentiment on the stock across the web. However no YOLOs into random stocks! I am creating full and detailed reports on each stock, find them on <a href=\"/r/trendtracker\">r/trendtracker</a>. I also take requests.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the first report on Rolls Royce.</p>\n\n<p>Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (<a href=\"https://rycey.pk/\">RYCEY.PK</a>)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Market Cap = 8.255 Billion</li>\n<li>Mentions percent increase (24 hour period) = 512%</li>\n<li>Mentions percent increase (7 day period) = 1336%</li>\n<li>Social media sentiment (as of 20 feb 2021) = 70% positive</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Summary:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC is a United Kingdom-based engineering company. The Company is focused on power and propulsion systems. Its segments include Civil Aerospace, which is engaged in the development, manufacture, marketing and sales of commercial aero engines and aftermarket services; Defence Aerospace, which is engaged in the development, manufacture, marketing and sales of military aero engines and aftermarket services, and caters to sectors, including combat aircraft, trainer aircraft and helicopters; Power Systems, which is engaged in the development, manufacture, marketing and sales of reciprocating engines and power systems. Power Systems provides power solutions and complete life-cycle support under product and solution brand MTU systems.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>SWOT Analysis</p>\n\n<p>Strengths:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brand Image</strong> - This company isn&#39;t going anywhere any time soon. They hold a reputation that often precedes them when it comes to quality and performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Product variation</strong> - The company is involved in multiple industries and products. They operate within Civil Aerospace, Defence Aerospace, Marine and Nuclear to name a few.</li>\n<li><strong>Few competitors</strong> - Due to the high skilled workforce required and high entry costs into the respective markets coupled with the economies of scale that Rolls royce has access to it will be incredibly hard to displace them in many of the industries that they are involved with. Rolls Royce also often wins government contracts that provide the business with further stability for example a 1 billion pound contract with the UK government for nuclear submarine cores (<a href=\"https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/37036/rolls-royce-wins-1bn-nuclear-submarine-contract-from-uk-government-44277.html\">https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/37036/rolls-royce-wins-1bn-nuclear-submarine-contract-from-uk-government-44277.html</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Weaknesses:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>COVID-19</strong> - The business has taken a big hit from the pandemic as demand for many of the products it sells has fallen, most notably in the aerospace sector. This is coupled with the fact that now that many businesses are weakened financially they may not feel that the extra expense of RR products are worth it, as they operate on a high price high quality pricing strategy, it may be that businesses look to cut corners on a cheaper alternative.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Opportunities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increased focus on automation</strong>: The company has really been investing in building self-driven cars. Self driven EVs look to be the future of auto travel and RR is at the cutting edge of the automation required to operate these vehicles. It may be that this is deployed in their own line of cars or that the technology is sold to other car manufacturers.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus on green and hybrid vehicles</strong> - predictably the company is focused on trying to build green and hybrid vehicles and the valuations of similar companies has risen dramatically as progress in this area is made. If RR makes some progress catching up to established players such as Tesla then there could be a potential upside in share price.</li>\n<li><strong>New forays into space exploration</strong> - RR has recently signed a contract with the UK Space Agency to look at the possibility of using nuclear power options in space exploration. This is extremely exciting as it shows intent in a sector that looks to make some great growth in the coming years and RR seems to be close to the head of that.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Threats:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Focus on sustainability</strong> - one of the issues with RR is that it does draw some of its income from civil aerospace. Following on from the pandemic and the rise of zoom, ideas such as &#39;the great reset&#39; are bringing air travel under fresh scrutiny it is possible that the industry will not recover to pre pandemic heights for some time due to the carbon footprint that flights cause.</li>\n<li><strong>Cost of raw materials</strong> - some raw material costs rising have been a minor issue in the supply chain.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Potential upside?</p>\n\n<p>Rolls royce seems focused on the future. If they can mount a good recovery from the COVID crash it seems there could still be a long way to go in terms of share price. A share currently trades for under a $ which shows a great investing opportunity as the stock may find its way back to the 3-4$ per share range. RR can also be seen as a very long term play. This company is on the cutting edge of research and development and it is not inconceivable that new technologies, such as electric aircraft, may allow them to make leaps and bounds in the coming years</p>\n\n<p>Yahoo Finance analysts provide a very mixed bag of recommendations, in the attached image, although the analysts price targets show a very different story as the lowest estimate (675) is still far greater than the current (98.66).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lol4bx/trend_tracker_detailed_stock_reports/","title":"Trend Tracker - detailed stock reports","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-21T13:31:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-21 13:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lol4bx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lol4bx/trend_tracker_detailed_stock_reports/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lol4bx/trend_tracker_detailed_stock_reports/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"teaheat","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/teaheat","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"teaheat","score":37,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"趋势跟踪器--详细的股票报告","the_new_excerpt":"我正试图建立一个分析整个网络上升趋势的社区。\n以便及早发现投资机会。这是用一种算法来实现的\n衡量某只股票在社交媒体上的提及率。还有\n一种决定股票总体情绪的算法... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"趨勢跟蹤器--詳細的股票報告","the_new_excerpt":"我正試圖建立一個分析整個網絡上升趨勢的社區。\n以便及早發現投資機會。這是用一種算法來實現的\n衡量某隻股票在社交媒體上的提及率。還有\n一種決定股票總體情緒的算法... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26326639","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26326639","title":"Möbius Printing Helper","date":"March 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Möbius印刷助手","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Möbius印刷助手","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lwhrcj","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwhrcj/squazozzle_update_32_attn_apes_altitude_2400/","title":"Squazozzle update 3/2: Attn apes, altitude +2,400%, please do not unfasten seatbelts to look behind at other rockets.
