The current price of APHA is lower than .83 of a TLRY share. Perhaps I&#39;m not understanding, but does this not mean that there&#39;s an obvious deal on APHA currently assuming the merger goes through? If the prices converge later, someone still would have been able to secure Tilray shares at a lower cost if they purchase now than simply buying Tilray shares. I&#39;m long on Tilray, and there of course risks (merger not going through, share price dropping significantly, etc.), but assuming these two stay the course and TLRY continues to rise isn&#39;t this a simple arbitrage opportunity? What am I missing?</p>\n\n<p>I additionally found an article which explains a way to limit downside (admittedly capping upside). Essentially the author suggests selling covered calls on APHA to maximize the arbitrage explained above. Would someone who is even more bullish be able to maximize returns even further by simply buying calls on Tilray currently for pre-merger?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any insight!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ldn816/tlry_and_apha_potential_arbitrage_opportunity/","title":"TLRY and APHA: Potential arbitrage opportunity?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-06T06:37:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-06 06:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ldn816","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldn816/tlry_and_apha_potential_arbitrage_opportunity/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldn816/tlry_and_apha_potential_arbitrage_opportunity/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"J_Asti","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/J_Asti","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"J_Asti","score":102,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"TLRY和APHA：潜在的套利机会？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，我有个问题。\n\n大麻公司Tilray和Aphria计划合并，形成最大的。\n到第二季度末，按收入计算的全球大麻公司。\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tilray-stock-rockets-after-reverse-merger-deal-with-aphria-to-create-largest-global-cannabis-company...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"TLRY和APHA：潛在的套利機會？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，我有個問題。\n\n大麻公司Tilray和Aphria計劃合併，形成最大的。\n到第二季度末，按收入計算的全球大麻公司。\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tilray-stock-rockets-after-reverse-merger-deal-with-aphria-to-create-largest-global-cannabis-company...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lkmf2w","excerpt":"This is coming from someone who's invested deep in ARKK and ARKG, but is anyone\nelse concerned if their growth is sustainable?
