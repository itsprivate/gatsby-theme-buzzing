I&#39;ve even got some massive returns from a few ideas I got solely from watching (MSTR +132% AMZN +73%, TGT +81%, NVDA +63%).</p>\n\n<p>Which takes us to this week where CNBC has been a constant whipping boy on <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">r/wallstreetbets</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Most of Reddit seems to completely reject CNBC&#39;s report that Melvin has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html\">closed</a> out their short positions.
