I joined a trading discord with a relatively small community of &quot;analysts.&quot; I had a free newcomer subscription and the allure of options pulled me in. I subsequently lost ~5k, which is quite a bit of money for me. The issue was I had no plan and failed to make use of stop losses. On top of that, I also ended up picking a handful of the losing trades. Fast forward to today, most of the positions I have are ETFs, with some stocks. Heavily weighted in tech, but my top positions are returning 80,90,100%. I&#39;ve recuperated about 80-90% of my losses and I think going forward, I&#39;m just going to build long positions and hold.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ky9kv5/i_lost_5k_to_options_when_i_first_opened_an/","title":"I lost ~5k to options when I first opened an account in June, almost recuperated thanks to ETFs and stocks","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-16T05:00:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-16 05:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ky9kv5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ky9kv5/i_lost_5k_to_options_when_i_first_opened_an/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ky9kv5/i_lost_5k_to_options_when_i_first_opened_an/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"blacklightstain","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/blacklightstain","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"blacklightstain","score":1522,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我6月份刚开户的时候亏了~5千块钱给期权，由于ETF和股票，几乎收回来了。","the_new_excerpt":"去年6月我刚开始做交易的时候，交了昂贵的学费。I\n加入了一个相对较小的 \"分析师 \"社区的交易discord。我曾\n一个免费的新人订阅和选项的诱惑把我拉了进来。I\n随后损失了约5千，这对我来说是相当大的一笔钱。这个问题...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我6月份剛開戶的時候虧了~5千塊錢給期權，由於ETF和股票，幾乎收回來了。","the_new_excerpt":"去年6月我剛開始做交易的時候，交了昂貴的學費。I\n加入了一個相對較小的 \"分析師 \"社區的交易discord。我曾\n一個免費的新人訂閱和選項的誘惑把我拉了進來。I\n隨後損失了約5千，這對我來說是相當大的一筆錢。這個問題...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1354172634456596481","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1354172634456596481","title":"If Melvin Capital is our Long Term Capital Management that means it's only 1997 https://t.co/YbM4PJMQUi","date":"January 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"如果说美尔文资本是我们的长期资本管理，那就意味着它只是1997年https://t.co/YbM4PJMQUi。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"如果說美爾文資本是我們的長期資本管理，那就意味着它只是1997年https://t.co/YbM4PJMQUi。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l5ke26","excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/yht0xbs71qd61.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26cfc80775814240f83f864d64c4b80525c1a262","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ke26/this_autist_filed_an_sec_complaint_against_melvin/","title":"This Autist filed an SEC complaint against Melvin Capital.
