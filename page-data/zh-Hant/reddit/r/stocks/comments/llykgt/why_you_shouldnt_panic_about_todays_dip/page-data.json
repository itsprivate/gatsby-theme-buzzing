They&#39;re one of many ways to find what&#39;s called &quot;resistance&quot; and &quot;support&quot; on a stock -- you can use moving averages or bollinger bands or 100 other things, but it&#39;s all going to give you the same thing: a bunch of lines on a stock chart that the price will bounce between.</p>\n\n<p>You can see that the stock market goes up and up and up until it can&#39;t take it anymore -- then it goes down. But when it goes down -- unless something really bad happens -- it always goes down to either the middle line or the bottom line, then it bounces right back up again.</p>\n\n<p>There is no bad news today. The market is just bouncing like it normally does.</p>\n\n<p>The market is going to keep dropping until QQQ reaches about $325.48 a share.
