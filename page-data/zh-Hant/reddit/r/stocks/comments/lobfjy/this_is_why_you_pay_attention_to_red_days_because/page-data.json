The market sell-off on Tuesday to Thursday was concentrated in recent high-growth stocks, across all market capitalizations. What I started to see on Thursday was a flight to value. What happened on Friday was a rotation of capital from pandemic stocks to small cap and mid cap stocks. </p>\n\n<p>On Friday, as the Finviz heat map shows, we saw a sell-off in 2020&#39;s growth stocks (i.e. mega cap tech, health care and consumer defensive stocks).</p>\n\n<p>The other thing the Finviz heat map shows is another move of capital into small caps and mid caps as investors take profits from large and mega caps that were pumped up by the pandemic and build more distributed portfolios. I.e. people are building new portfolios for 2021&#39;s that move away from pandemic stocks.</p>\n\n<p>This is important information to pay attention to. Which is why, in my opinion, you don&#39;t ignore Red days, or complain about people you think are naive or inexperienced investors when they sit up and start asking questions or selling stocks they think have topped out to buy new stocks that they think are better going forward. </p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re not ready to take information that the Red days offer us, and update/rebalance your portfolio going forward based on that information, you&#39;re going to miss out on signals that the environment may be changing. And then you might get stuck in diminishing returns as the market moves in a different direction than the portfolio you&#39;re sitting in serves best. </p>\n\n<p>IMO, the action last week suggests people who are going to sit in a 2020-inspired pandemic portfolio for all of 2021 will probably see diminishing returns. </p>\n\n<p>The rotations into small and mid caps, and also from mega cap growth to value, have been taking place from time to time since the November election, and it seems to be an accelerating trend. Last week also saw a big drop in gold prices at the same time as a stiff uptick in consumer interest rates, which indicates a move away from pandemic safe havens, into higher interest and higher yield investments. The selling of gold into a consumer interest rate hike also suggests the move to value investing in the latter half of last week isn&#39;t just noise, because gold is also a hedge against inflation and has tended to go up during times of climbing interest rates. </p>\n\n<p>So everyone who is bashing Red day alarmists in threads where you talk about how you got big gains in 2020 for doing nothing but investing in Apple type stocks, buying in at the March bottom or riding SPY for 100% gains, if you&#39;re not updating your portfolio for 2021 right now, you&#39;re probably underperforming the market as these sector and market cap rotations occur. </p>\n\n<p>For me, last week was the week where I disengaged from a lot of EV sector investments, leaving only a few percent of my portfolio in them. And I was ready to catch the small and mid cap industrial bounce on Friday, which was a big green day for me even tho the indices were flat. </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I expect these trends to small cap, mid cap and value stocks to continue throughout the Spring and I expect the money for those gains will continue to come from the mega cap tech stocks and pandemic portfolio positions that people/institutional investors are are taking profits from. </p>\n\n<p>The Red days raise alarms that something is happening and that something is sometimes a change in direction. So I see the rotation out of mega cap and large cap pandemic plays and into small cap, mid cap and value + growth stocks is a trend that is firming up. </p>\n\n<p>That trend is probably going to become very significant by the end of the quarter, in March, when institutional and professional investors have to rebalance their portfolios across asset classes, take profits and cut bloated positions. The shift in interest rates and asset class rotations is a significant change in investing environment. If you&#39;re still sitting in passive index ETFs or pandemic stocks, you may want to start preparing for a rebalance, too. </p>\n\n<p>There will probably be more Red days like this one, particularly toward the end of March. So for many who are still sitting in pandemic portfolios, you might have a Red March if you don&#39;t start revisiting your holdings in February.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lobfjy/this_is_why_you_pay_attention_to_red_days_because/","title":"This is why you pay attention to Red Days (because it's healthy to notice when market rotations occur) (Heat map of Friday, 02/19)","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-20T19:15:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-20 19:15","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lobfjy","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lobfjy/this_is_why_you_pay_attention_to_red_days_because/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lobfjy/this_is_why_you_pay_attention_to_red_days_because/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"rhetorical_twix","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rhetorical_twix","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"rhetorical_twix","score":645,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"这就是为什么你要关注 \"红日 \"的原因（因为注意到市场轮动的时间是健康的）（02/19周五的热图）。","the_new_excerpt":"Finviz市场热图 02/19 [https://imgur.com/VZAXcd7]\n\n股指走红是有原因的，当它走红时，你应该时刻保持警惕。\n周二至周四的市场抛盘集中在近期的\n高成长股，跨越所有市值。我开始看到的\n星期四...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這就是爲什麼你要關注 \"紅日 \"的原因（因爲注意到市場輪動的時間是健康的）（02/19週五的熱圖）。","the_new_excerpt":"Finviz市場熱圖 02/19 [https://imgur.com/VZAXcd7]\n\n股指走紅是有原因的，當它走紅時，你應該時刻保持警惕。\n週二至週四的市場拋盤集中在近期的\n高成長股，跨越所有市值。我開始看到的\n星期四...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lw7z8v","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw7z8v/update_gme_broke_through_the_pennant_next_stop_is/","title":"UPDATE. $GME broke through the pennant.
