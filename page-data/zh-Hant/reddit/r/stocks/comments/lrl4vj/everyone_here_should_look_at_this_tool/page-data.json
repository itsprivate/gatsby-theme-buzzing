There&#39;s a particular solar company that I am heavily invested in. They have earnings coming up and a few minutes on this tool I could gauge that my initial thesis to be long does line up with the data this tool is showing. In fact, if the tool is accurate, the share price will skyrocket. Once the earnings are out I will come back and report how valid the data is.
