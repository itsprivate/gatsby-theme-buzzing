And will then buy back in when he believes the price will start increasing, thereby gaining all the recouped -% change that he avoided and stacking his future +% change on top of his previous sell price from before when he expected the price to go down.</p>\n\n<p>In summary the question you need to ask yourself is &quot;Which is more likely, a price increase or a price decrease?&quot; And to trade accordingly to make the best and safest bets.</p>\n\n<p>For example I&#39;ve been seeing many people here foolishly complaining about having bought into stocks that &quot;became meme stocks&quot; because &quot;how dare people pump up the price of my long term investments so that I can get gains now that would have taken much longer, I&#39;m not happy about this unsustainably high price that I got in on the ground floor of so I&#39;m going to hold until the price goes back down and then I&#39;m going to hold until my longterm profits eventually get the price up this far in a sustainable way.&quot; Really great way to miss out on a lot of money. If you asked almost anybody yesterday about MJ stocks, they would tell you that the price was pumped and that it would crash soon, so the obvious conclusion to the smart person was to get out before losing from all that far more likely -% change rather than risk an unlikely further +% change. Going forward MJ is still expected to be a likely and high longterm +% change, so most people should be cautiously looking to see if the current floor holds or if it continues to bleed a further -% change before buying in on the anticipation of more +% change.</p>\n\n<p>Another fallacy: &quot;Timing the market vs. Time in the market&quot;</p>\n\n<p>This is a false dichotomy, which favors the previously mentioned longterm &quot;sell high&quot; fallacy in ignorance of the actual &quot;gain +% change and avoid -% changes&quot; The correct method is always to do both as best you can. If you invest during a high stock market, wait 10 years and then check your investments, it won&#39;t matter how long you&#39;ve been in the market if you miss-timed a longterm play and are currently in a market crash which are typical due to typical large ebb/flow economic trends.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;gain +% change and avoid -% changes&quot; do this for as much as you are able, if you day trade, sell when you expect it will go down and buy when you expect it will go up. If you swing trade look at the broader trends of news and the price history and buy when you expect it to go up, sell when you expect it to go down. If you&#39;re a longterm investor look at the company&#39;s fundamentals and buy those that are undervalued and will go up.</p>\n\n<p>Some of The best plays are those that combine expected long term +% change and expected short term +% change for reduced likelihood of unexpected dips and more +% change opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately the future prices are probabilistic and may often not match your expectations and you will often miss out on trade opportunities, you just need to keep trying to make the plays that will net you the best +% changes, and if you make good decisions you should average positive % gains.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Other things: absolute price#/stock#/etc. are mostly arbitrary, except for their implications with meaningful metrics like market cap. It is mostly irrelevant to you how many shares you bought, what price it is, etc. all that matters is what proportion of your funds have you invested, what % change do you expect the stock to undergo in the future, and how quickly do you expect it to happen.</p>\n\n<p>Utilizing outside normal hours volatility gains/spikes is often a great time to sell (which is why retail investors are sidelined from trading then by most brokers, can&#39;t have a level playing field or the house wouldn&#39;t always win), afternoon lows are frequently great buying points and decently reliable.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/li0b78/understanding_the_stock_market_todays_mj_aphatlry/","title":"Understanding The Stock Market (Todays MJ APHA/TLRY etc. example)","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-12T05:33:07.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-12 05:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"li0b78","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/li0b78/understanding_the_stock_market_todays_mj_aphatlry/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/li0b78/understanding_the_stock_market_todays_mj_aphatlry/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"notouchmygnocchi","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/notouchmygnocchi","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"notouchmygnocchi","score":123,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"理解股市（Todays MJ APHA/TLRY等例子）。","the_new_excerpt":"\"低买高卖 \"这句话有一个简单的谬误被忽略了。它\n是理想的结果，但它幼稚地忽略了实际的方法/目标，即\n是 \"获得+%的变化，避免-%的变化\"。\n\n这种微妙的细微差别，对你如何做出你的\n交易...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"理解股市（Todays MJ APHA/TLRY等例子）。","the_new_excerpt":"\"低買高賣 \"這句話有一個簡單的謬誤被忽略了。它\n是理想的結果，但它幼稚地忽略了實際的方法/目標，即\n是 \"獲得+%的變化，避免-%的變化\"。\n\n這種微妙的細微差別，對你如何做出你的\n交易...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26224709","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26224709","title":"Launch HN: H3X (YC W21) – High power density electric aircraft motors","date":"February 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"发射HN：H3X(YC W21)--高功率密度飞机电机","locale":"zh"},{"title":"發射HN：H3X(YC W21)--高功率密度飛機電機","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1364043102978265090","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1364043102978265090","title":"This is rich https://t.co/B3rig1Wzv0","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 23, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"这是丰富的https://t.co/B3rig1Wzv0。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"這是豐富的https://t.co/B3rig1Wzv0。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-li0b78","previousId":"HnPost-26224709","nextId":"TweetPost-1364043102978265090","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/li0b78/understanding_the_stock_market_todays_mj_aphatlry/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
