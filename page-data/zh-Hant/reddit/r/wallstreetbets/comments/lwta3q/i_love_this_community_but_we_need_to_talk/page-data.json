The variety of people, the thoroughness of their research, and the veracity with which they defend it, make this place what it is.  </p>\n\n<p>I only began trading as a side hustle at the start of the pandemic (with modest success).  My biggest wins came from WSB.  When the real push on GME started, I was there.  I was a bag holder of GME after January, but my bag wasn&#39;t too large  and I liked the stock, so I grew some diamond hands and held.  I started really following the day-to-day threads, reading every piece of financial news I could, watched Bruce eat his bagels, and developed a much deeper understanding of the market in general.  </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t listen to all the advice I see on here... and I don&#39;t blindly trust DD.  </p>\n\n<p>Why I feel I need to post today:<br/>\nThe mood in this sub has changed drastically over the last 24 hours.  The rift I see between the GME folks and the RKT folks saddens me greatly.  I don&#39;t know exactly how I fee about RKT... something just seems too contrived about it.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen some DD that suggests it&#39;s a HF ploy to pull people out of GME.  If that&#39;s the case, I don&#39;t think it will be successful.  GME apes are strong.  You don&#39;t just lose your diamond hands on a whim.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen other DD that suggests it&#39;s a HF hedge and their using this to boost their capital in order to better defend their position in GME/AMC.  This seems a bit more plausible to me, but I&#39;m  still not 100% convinced.  A lot of people are posting massive gains (sincere congratulations). </p>\n\n<p>What conclusion I have come to is this.  If I were a HF or a MM who needed WSB to fracture, I would seed disunity and distrust among the community.  I would send every bot or shill I could in every direction.  Some strongly defending RKT, some tearing it down.  Some screaming GME is dead, while others quietly suggest taking gains from RKT and rolling them into UWMC.  I wouldn&#39;t suggest a shit stock that I knew nobody would listen about... I would use my best DD and find something that could tear attention away from GME and tear the community apart.  And unfortunately, I think it&#39;s starting to work.  Just reading the daily discussion thread for today is like watching two 3-year-olds argue about what superhero would win in a fight.  </p>\n\n<p>I love this community.  I hope that some of you may read this and that it may make a small difference.  When it comes to money, it&#39;s easy to manipulate peoples feelings.  I just hope that in the end, Apes Together Strong is the sentiment.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck today everyone, and thank you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwta3q/i_love_this_community_but_we_need_to_talk/","title":"I love this community... but we need to talk.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-03T23:33:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-03 23:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lwta3q","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwta3q/i_love_this_community_but_we_need_to_talk/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwta3q/i_love_this_community_but_we_need_to_talk/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"RainAlwaysComes","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/RainAlwaysComes","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"RainAlwaysComes","score":3709,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我爱这个社区... 但我们需要谈谈。","the_new_excerpt":"我已经在这个子里潜伏了很久了，甚至在我长出一双眼睛，并开始\n浸入市场。各种各样的人，彻底的\n他们的研究，以及他们为之辩护的真实性，使这里成为了一个\n它是。\n\n我只是作为副业开始交易，在开始...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我愛這個社區... 但我們需要談談。","the_new_excerpt":"我已經在這個子裏潛伏了很久了，甚至在我長出一雙眼睛，並開始\n浸入市場。各種各樣的人，徹底的\n他們的研究，以及他們爲之辯護的真實性，使這裏成爲了一個\n它是。\n\n我只是作爲副業開始交易，在開始...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26453083","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26453083","title":"Repealing Section 230 won’t do what anyone wants","date":"March 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"废除第230条并不能如大家所愿。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"廢除第230條並不能如大家所願。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m4w0f3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4w0f3/my_chartfor_you/","title":"My chart....for You.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 14, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我的图....》为您提供。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的圖....》爲您提供。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lwta3q","previousId":"HnPost-26453083","nextId":"RedditPost-m4w0f3","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwta3q/i_love_this_community_but_we_need_to_talk/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
