No one is going to care for you if you go broke we are not privileged like Melvin. </p>\n\n<p>2) Down a lot on a stock? The question is would you buy more of that stock at that price.

Sell a position and diversify</p>\n\n<p>3) Recognise when a stock is dead. If everyone says it’s going up. It’s reached the top. </p>\n\n<p>4) Diversify retard.
