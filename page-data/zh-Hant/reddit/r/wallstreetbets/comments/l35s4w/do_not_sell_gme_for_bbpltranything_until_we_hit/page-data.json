Shut up. Stop.</p>\n\n<p>Mods have created a false narrative that the GME play is done for by making GME gains threads posts (who could this benefit??? Think critically.) Meme stocks mooning upon GME halt, RH WSBers did not move a 56.7B cap (PLTR) that fast upon halt, along with BB/AMC/? shortly thereafter. Who would it benefit to pump these stocks and take eyes off of GME upon halt? Think. Paper-handed fucks posting realized gains, bots talking about selling. Think about it, nothing is coincidental here. This play is no where near done. You paper-handed fucks will rue the day that this hits high triple/four digits.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not shitting you. Price action today looked to be largely result of a gamma squeeze (MM&#39;s selling smooth-brains their FD&#39;s, MM&#39;s think FD no chance be ITM, MM&#39;s not buy a lot shares hedge, uh-oh FD&#39;s ITM MM&#39;s buy lot shares to stay delta-neutral). This means short-int is still high as fuck (AKA the highest % in history). This means unprecedented possibility in terms of price. Do not fucking sell. Do not fucking buy options. Hold shares! No more of this paper-handed bullshit.</p>\n\n<p>Numerous meme stocks pump upon GME halt -&gt; maybe draw a bit of a certain group elsewhere? Coincidentally, they pump when it halts, when gains threads are posted, and when threads are unpinned. Hint: us small guys don&#39;t move fast enough to pump that quickly upon halt. These guys are hurting, bad. Hold.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Fuck off with the BB/PLTR shite, diamond hands GME.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Obligatory fucking rocket emojis. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>*<strong><em>NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE</em></strong>* PLAY YOUR OWN PLAYS </p>\n\n<p>Position: 1533 x GME Shares basis @ 40.56</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Edit 3: GME Weekend Discussion Thread unpinned : Do with that what you will.
