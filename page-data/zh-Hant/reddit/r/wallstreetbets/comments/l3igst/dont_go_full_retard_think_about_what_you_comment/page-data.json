Since our community is starting to get very big right now and get a lot of media attention it is important that we think about what we comment and post. As a reddit user since many years back I have seen and been a part of communities that were shut down. Let me give you some exampels.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/r/WatchPeopleDie\">r/WatchPeopleDie</a> ♰15 March 2019 was a controversial subreddit from the very beginning since the main focus was to post media of real-life human deaths. After many years of complaints it was allowed to stay up as a quarantined subreddit. So what happend? The Christchurch shooting happened, long story made short a dude livestreamed a video of himself shooting up a mosque. Government agencies in different countries told people in general to not spread the video, guess what WPD did? Ye they posted the video... many times. But reddit didn&#39;t ban them immediately, they removed the posts they found and posted a sticky on the subreddit where reddit staff urged the users to not FUCKING POST THE VIDEO. But WPD went full retard and kept posting it. In a blink of an eye the whole subreddit was deleted, wiped from the face of this earth, gone forever. This went fast too, literally all of this happened within one day. For the same reason <a href=\"/r/Gore\">r/Gore</a> ♰15 March 2019 was banned within 10 minutes after WPD.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/r/Physical_Removal\">r/Physical_Removal</a> ♰15 August 2017 advocated/joked/memed about violence against leftists but was allowed to exist because after all you know it&#39;s just memes lol. Then during the Unite the right rally in Charlottesville a person was killed by a car driven by a rightwinger. This sub went full retard and started to mock the dead person by being offensive and posting pictures/videos of the incident. This caused huge media attention and thereby pressure on reddit which resulted in the ban.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/r/DarkNetMarkets\">r/DarkNetMarkets</a> was a sub that was mostly about discussion about markets and vendors. This was enough for US authorities to pressure reddit on information about users on there and probably the reason why they removed it. People never actually sold stuff over this subreddit, but the discussion about the darknet markets was enough.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/r/pizzagate\">r/pizzagate</a> was a sub dedicated to the pizzagate conspiracy and was banned because they doxed a person believed to be a part of the conspiracy.</p>\n\n<p>This is just a few examples of communities that I know about and some of them I myself was a part of. Many more communities have been deleted than the ones mentioned here that I don&#39;t even know about. And I am getting worried about WSB because I am starting to see resemblances with WSB and subreddits that were shutdown.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We are starting to pick fights with people in the real world out there while at the same time the memes are getting more aggressive. We don&#39;t want to pick fights with the wrong people/institutions, now it turns out Citron was just a guy in an apartment lol, but next time? We picking fights with large banks? SEC? Remember the examples above, government agencies have put pressure on reddit before to shut shit down, if they want to get rid of us believe me they can do it.</li>\n<li>Media attention is getting big. This is not good, media have put pressure on reddit before as I showed you above, if we upset them, fuck with them, pick fight with them or whatever that makes them not like us the media can fuck us back hard just like before.</li>\n<li>Pump-and-dump of a stock is illegal and we don&#39;t want to fuck with the law. Remember above, <a href=\"/r/darknetmarkets\">r/darknetmarkets</a> was only discussing illegal stuff not doing it on the subreddit but that was still enough for big government to fuck them. What you are doing when you write stuff like &quot;LET US PUMP XXX ROCKETSHIP EMOJI&quot; is giving them a reason to fuck us so stop doing it.</li>\n<li>Stop doxing. Remember <a href=\"/r/pizzagate\">r/pizzagate</a> was banned because of doxing. So when u dox this Citron guy and send pizza to his fucking place that&#39;s putting the whole subreddit at risk.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t want WSB to end up in the same graveyard as my other beloved subreddits that are lying there. So think about what you are commenting and posting, we got the media watching us right now and maybe even government agencies are taking interest in us too. And most important of all, if the admins on reddit tell us to stop doing something then u fucking stop doing that thing. Because if it goes that far the admins probably have CIA breathing down their necks.</p>\n\n<p>Also backup subs doesn&#39;t work it has already been tried before. <a href=\"/r/beatingwomen\">r/beatingwomen</a> tried <a href=\"/r/beatingwomen2\">r/beatingwomen2</a>, <a href=\"/r/incels\">r/incels</a> tried <a href=\"/r/braincells\">r/braincells</a>... didn&#39;t work. So if we wanna make a backup plan we need to get more sophisticated, maybe create our own platform.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway shoutout to PLTR gang may tendieman come visit us🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Stop buying and giving me awards, I don&#39;t even know wth they do or what I am supposed to do with them. Spend ur money on stocks instead.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3igst/dont_go_full_retard_think_about_what_you_comment/","title":"Don't go full retard.
