WHAT IS WORNG WITH YOU RETARDS? They got EXACTLY what they wanted. And you know what the worst part is?</p>\n\n<p><strong>YOU RETARDS EVEN TOLD US THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Did you think that the hedge funds would just run away in fear and loose their face AND money? Didn&#39;t you think they&#39;d fight with dirty moves and get away with it? Haven&#39;t you learned from 2008?</p>\n\n<p>Face it! We&#39;re apes. And now we&#39;re not together, because they spread lies, misinformation and doubt on reddit, news and magazines. They can trick the DUMB. Are you dumb?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not going to lie, I first joined the whole train for the fast money and bought @270€ for 2k€, because I have debts of 10k€ and a lawsuit going against me. I can&#39;t afford to pay back anymore because COVID made me loose my job. I&#39;m basically fucked and don&#39;t know what to do and stand with my back at the wall. But guess what?</p>\n\n<p><strong>I STILL HOLD.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t about money anymore. This isn&#39;t about saving before shit goes down. This isn&#39;t about believe that the squeeze will come.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is because I believe in you retards and I want wallstreet to bleed for what they did.</strong></p>\n\n<p>And so should you! Stop whining, stop getting in doubt.</p>\n\n<p>For ONE fucking time in your life - just do <strong>NOTHING</strong> and <strong>HOLD</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>WSB showed the whole world how fucked up the market is. And if they played by the rules, we&#39;d have fucked them in a very autistic and ironic way. But guess what.
