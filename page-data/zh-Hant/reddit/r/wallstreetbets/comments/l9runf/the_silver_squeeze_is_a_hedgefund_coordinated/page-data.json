There are quite a few wsb-logo Twitter accounts pushing this. This is BS &amp; the straight up the ANTITHESIS of who we are. </p>\n\n<p>By buying silver/going long on silver, you would be directly putting money into the pockets of the EXACT HEDGE FUNDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF $GME 🚀 🚀 🚀 💎 🙌  The hedge funds are LONG silver NOT short silver.</p>\n\n<p>The media, Wall Street, normies, and every other non-WSB autist are trying to push you to buy silver. This would be a tragic, irreversible decision that not only will most likely not make you any money because the squeeze is fake, it will put you on the sidelines from this righteous and glorious war we are in. </p>\n\n<p>If you are looking for alternative investments to GME, I’d recommend simply getting in on the $BANG GANG- Blackberry, AMC, Nokia, and GME. </p>\n\n<p>For the feds and the media and all the dumb people reading this, I am the last thing from a financial advisor and am a complete, 100%, full retard autist. </p>\n\n<p>BANG GANG CHEEEEEEEHOOOOOOOOO</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I am not talking down on silver as an investment, I am not saying it&#39;s not a good hedge, I&#39;m not saying anything bad about silver in any form. I&#39;m simply pointing out that right now, this &quot;squeeze&quot; that all these people are referring to is definitely not a &quot;squeeze&quot; at all and is an artificial hedge-fund driven attempt to reduce the GME momentum and we should all be cognizant of the media manipulation and happening everywhere including right here. For all you that want to buy silver, great, buying the bullion directly in my humble autistic opinion is better than shares in a fund that supposedly buys it but don&#39;t trust some autist on the internet. BANG GANG</p>\n\n<p>Edit #2: Fellow autists, we have ascended to the #2 post on all of reddit. Our $GME gains this week and beyond will carry us to the gates of Valhalla. Look to your left, now look to your right, these are your brethren and sisterthren who will diamond hands with you until we all pass down these tendies to our children&#39;s children. Onward.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/","title":"The Silver Squeeze is a hedge-fund coordinated attack so they can keep fighting the $GME fight","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-01T05:33:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-01 05:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l9runf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"RizzutosNOTAWORD","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/RizzutosNOTAWORD","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"RizzutosNOTAWORD","score":73178,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"白银挤压是对冲基金的协调攻击，这样他们就可以继续打GME的战斗了。","the_new_excerpt":"如果你没有浏览过WSB或做自己的研究，你可能会\n认为微博上的人说有银子挤兑是正确的。\n发生，我们都应该得到在它。有不少wsb-logo的Twitter\n账号推送的这。这是BS&直的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"白銀擠壓是對沖基金的協調攻擊，這樣他們就可以繼續打GME的戰鬥了。","the_new_excerpt":"如果你沒有瀏覽過WSB或做自己的研究，你可能會\n認爲微博上的人說有銀子擠兌是正確的。\n發生，我們都應該得到在它。有不少wsb-logo的Twitter\n賬號推送的這。這是BS&直的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lfvp5a","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfvp5a/diamond_hands_diamond_bags_baby/","title":"Diamond hands, Diamond bags baby.","date":"February 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"钻石的手，钻石的包，宝贝。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"鑽石的手，鑽石的包，寶貝。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26066528","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26066528","title":"The largest study to date on the genetic basis of sexuality (2019)","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 09, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"迄今规模最大的性行为遗传基础研究(2019年)","locale":"zh"},{"title":"迄今規模最大的性行爲遺傳基礎研究(2019年)","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l9runf","previousId":"RedditPost-lfvp5a","nextId":"HnPost-26066528","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
