That would have caused Citadel and Point72 to have a portion of their portion go to $0 which would have hurt their returns. They decided to pump more money into it to prevent bankruptcy. </p>\n\n<p>Sounds like these hedge funds are vultures coming in to feast on the carcass.</p>\n\n<p>Who is going to bailout Citadel and Point72 when they get squeezed too?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management are investing $2.75 billion into hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, which has been hard hit by a series of short bets to start the year.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The influx of cash is expected to help stabilize Melvin, which has lost 30% for the year through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Melvin started the year with $12.5 billion and had been one of the best performing hedge funds on Wall Street in recent years. The losses stem from Melvin’s array of short-bets against companies and have stunned clients and other traders.</p>\n\n<p>Citadel and its partners are investing $2 billion and Point72, which already had more than $1 billion invested in Melvin as of 2019, $750 million. The investments are for non-controlling revenue shares in the hedge fund. Melvin founder Gabe Plotkin was a top portfolio manager at Point72’s predecessor firm, SAC Capital Management before he left to start Melvin.</p>\n\n<p>It couldn’t be determined how much of a revenue share Citadel and Point72 would get.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos1\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos1</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4wgmn/you_autists_did_it_the_first_casualty_of_the_big/","title":"You autists did it: The First Casualty Of The Big Short Squeeze: Melvin Capital Gets $2.75BN Bailout From Citadel, Point72 After Its Shorts Explode","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T03:56:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 03:56","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l4wgmn","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4wgmn/you_autists_did_it_the_first_casualty_of_the_big/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4wgmn/you_autists_did_it_the_first_casualty_of_the_big/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/AInq5jMYwDDyj-3isHdQVxaazZhbndFTlK7EZxUpEtc.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7067c5ddc2ca1a2835baaa2f166b4d0c4d3323f3","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"dopexile","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/dopexile","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"dopexile","score":8346,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你们自闭症患者做到了。大空头挤压的第一个牺牲品： 梅尔文资本从Citadel和Point72那里获得27.5亿美金的援助，因为它的短线爆发了。","the_new_excerpt":"你们这些赌博堕落的家伙竟然让一个对冲基金破产了，这让我们不得不对你们进行调查。\n救市。\n\n美尔文资本为什么不能直接卸载Robinhood应用，重新安装到\n恢复他们的保存游戏并拿回他们的钱?????。\n\n从字里行间可以看出，我认为梅尔文得到了一个保证金的要求，这将是\n擦拭...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們自閉症患者做到了。大空頭擠壓的第一個犧牲品： 梅爾文資本從Citadel和Point72那裏獲得27.5億美金的援助，因爲它的短線爆發了。","the_new_excerpt":"你們這些賭博墮落的傢伙竟然讓一個對沖基金破產了，這讓我們不得不對你們進行調查。\n救市。\n\n美爾文資本爲什麼不能直接卸載Robinhood應用，重新安裝到\n恢復他們的保存遊戲並拿回他們的錢?????。\n\n從字裏行間可以看出，我認爲梅爾文得到了一個保證金的要求，這將是\n擦拭...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1356728199850393602","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1356728199850393602","title":"41% annualized revenue growth under Jeff Bezos since Amazon went public in 1997.
