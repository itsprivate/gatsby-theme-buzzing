She was very much a kind soul and cared for others immensely. She has done more with what she had than most I know who hit the genetic lottery. If any of you are inspired by this post to donate any of your GME gains, please send it here, post in this thread, and I&#39;ll pass it along to her family.</p>\n\n<p>Positions - 10 4/15 2021 30c, 500 shares (and I&#39;m <em>never fucking selling</em>)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxvaik/gme_giving_back/","title":"GME - Giving Back","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-15T21:41:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-15 21:41","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kxvaik","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxvaik/gme_giving_back/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxvaik/gme_giving_back/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/2tG_snnNmPKhJjEOfUc1UsNm-6fJlI8p_4TIVoYMnYY.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d59de5c10e2a4dcbbdd2c18943ddfcab308f50c9","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"TheGunStays","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheGunStays","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"TheGunStays","score":1544,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME - 回馈","the_new_excerpt":"在卖出了一些1/15 30美元的看涨期权后（价格低于我潜在的可能，但我已经卖出了。\n准备让它们过期不值钱），我想回馈一些东西。这个\n基本上是捡来的钱，因为这里是赌场，而我是弱智（很明显）。\n\n全国[$ROPE]防范热线...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME - 回饋","the_new_excerpt":"在賣出了一些1/15 30美元的看漲期權後（價格低於我潛在的可能，但我已經賣出了。\n準備讓它們過期不值錢），我想回饋一些東西。這個\n基本上是撿來的錢，因爲這裏是賭場，而我是弱智（很明顯）。\n\n全國[$ROPE]防範熱線...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25914973","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25914973","title":"Bryan Fogel on why streaming platforms were scared of releasing The Dissident","date":"January 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"布莱恩-福格尔谈流媒体平台为何害怕发布《异见者》？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"布萊恩-福格爾談流媒體平臺爲何害怕發佈《異見者》？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l5cvvr","excerpt":"Plug Power has exceeded its 2020 gross billings target and is raising 2021\nestimates to $475M, up from $450M.
