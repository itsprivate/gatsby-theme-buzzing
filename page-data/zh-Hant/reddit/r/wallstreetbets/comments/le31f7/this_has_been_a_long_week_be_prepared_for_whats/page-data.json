Like holy shit this last week has been amazing. But the accompanying stories have ruined my loss boner, so it’s time to address this. </p>\n\n<p>There have been increasing posts of people pouring their life savings into GME and other meme stocks, hopping on the hype train hoping to make a buck. This is an absolutely terrible idea. <strong>You should absolutely never invest money you cannot afford to lose.</strong> And if you made some money, take out your initial investment and play with the gains, it’s free money after all.</p>\n\n<p>Us OG’s want to see you make money. That’s what the sub is about. We want to see people take stupid fucking risks, but not lose their livelihood doing it. Please also remember to do your own DD. Or at the very least, click on some of the links people put in their DD and try and understand how they reached that conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>Next, recognize what a <em>”pump &amp; dump”</em> scheme is. We’ve seen a lot of them come through this sub in the past, so we know what to watch out for. Many new folks however, aren’t familiar with any of that. If you see someone try to hype up a security, do research into it before you buy. If there’s no new news out or they’re a tiny company, absolutely <strong>DO NOT</strong> get involved. You will get burned. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, it’s okay to take profits. You never lose when you’re up and cash out, you’re just securing those gains. It’s also okay to take the loss and reinvest in something else. There are no rules dictating you have to make that money back in that same stock.</p>\n\n<p>And remember this saying: <em>”Bulls make money. Bears make money. Pigs get slaughtered.”</em></p>\n\n<p>Don’t be a pig. Don’t get greedy. </p>\n\n<p>Welcome to the casino. Stay a while. But remember to check out some other tables/machines. Don’t go all in on craps when you don’t know how to play craps. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: read the fucking post you shits</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Positions because I’m a degenerate retard:</p>\n\n<p>Cash from GME and TSLA gains. Currently a liquid portfolio until Monday.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le31f7/this_has_been_a_long_week_be_prepared_for_whats/","title":"This has been a long week, be prepared for what’s to come.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-07T04:29:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-07 04:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"le31f7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le31f7/this_has_been_a_long_week_be_prepared_for_whats/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le31f7/this_has_been_a_long_week_be_prepared_for_whats/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"LegalHelpNeeded3","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LegalHelpNeeded3","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"LegalHelpNeeded3","score":1951,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"这一周很漫长，要做好准备，迎接未来的到来。","the_new_excerpt":"作为子的老会员，我TMD很喜欢亏损色情。就像我的妈呀这\n上周已经很神奇了。但随之而来的故事却毁了我的失落感\n骨子里，所以是时候解决这个问题了。\n\n有越来越多的帖子说，有人把一生的积蓄都投入到金交所中去了\n和其他备忘录股，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這一週很漫長，要做好準備，迎接未來的到來。","the_new_excerpt":"作爲子的老會員，我TMD很喜歡虧損色情。就像我的媽呀這\n上週已經很神奇了。但隨之而來的故事卻毀了我的失落感\n骨子裏，所以是時候解決這個問題了。\n\n有越來越多的帖子說，有人把一生的積蓄都投入到金交所中去了\n和其他備忘錄股，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-llg0ke","excerpt":"While many may argue that value investing doesn't make sense anymore, a lot of\nthese rules and investment principles from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham\nstand the test of time, especially when you apply current nuance to these their\ninvestment rules (which are now close to a century…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/llg0ke/17_investment_principles_from_warren_buffett_and/","title":"17 Investment Principles from Warren Buffett and the late Benjamin Graham","date":"February 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"巴菲特和已故本杰明-格雷厄姆的17条投资原则","the_new_excerpt":"虽然很多人可能会认为价值投资没有意义了，但很多\n巴菲特和本杰明-格雷厄姆的这些规则和投资原则。\n经得起时间的考验，特别是当你把当前的细微差别应用到这些他们的\n投资规则（现在已经接近百年...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"巴菲特和已故本傑明-格雷厄姆的17條投資原則","the_new_excerpt":"雖然很多人可能會認爲價值投資沒有意義了，但很多\n巴菲特和本傑明-格雷厄姆的這些規則和投資原則。\n經得起時間的考驗，特別是當你把當前的細微差別應用到這些他們的\n投資規則（現在已經接近百年...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-llhfdj","excerpt":"There was some \"weird\" speculation on this sub a few days ago that Warren\nperhaps bought into Tesla...it ended up being Verizon and Chevron (lol)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. cut its Apple Inc. holding…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/llhfdj/berkshire_trims_apple_bet_reveals_chevron_verizon/","title":"Berkshire trims Apple bet, reveals Chevron, Verizon holdings","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 17, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"伯克希尔下调苹果押注，透露雪佛龙、威瑞森持股。","the_new_excerpt":"几天前，在这个子上有一些 \"奇怪 \"的猜测，华伦?\n或许买下了特斯拉......最后变成了Verizon和雪佛龙（呵呵）。\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n巴菲特旗下的伯克希尔哈撒韦公司减持苹果公司...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"伯克希爾下調蘋果押注，透露雪佛龍、威瑞森持股。","the_new_excerpt":"幾天前，在這個子上有一些 \"奇怪 \"的猜測，華倫?\n或許買下了特斯拉......最後變成了Verizon和雪佛龍（呵呵）。\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n巴菲特旗下的伯克希爾哈撒韋公司減持蘋果公司...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-le31f7","previousId":"RedditPost-llg0ke","nextId":"RedditPost-llhfdj","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le31f7/this_has_been_a_long_week_be_prepared_for_whats/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
