It&#39;s important for us to remember about the human impact of this shameless attempt to profit from inorganically destroying a business. From GME&#39;s latest 10-K filing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Employees</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>We have approximately 14,000 full-time salaried and hourly employees and between 22,000 and 42,000 part-time hourly employees worldwide, depending on the time of year. Fluctuation in the number of part-time hourly employees is due to the seasonality of our business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s right. Melvin Capital tried to  force 42,000 hard working employees into unemployment for profit. And for what? So Gabe Plotkin could <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/miami/2020/12/07/melvin-capital-founder-revealed-as-buyer-of-44m-miami-beach-property-sources/\">buy every single house around his compound in Miami so he doesn&#39;t have to gaze upon us poor&#39;s</a>?  Tell me, Gabe. When does it all end, huh? How many yachts can you water-ski behind? How much is enough?</p>\n\n<p>When you buy GME shares, you&#39;re saving the livelihood of the Gamestop employee so he can continue to earn an honest living and maybe even one day feel a human female boob. Put another way-- you&#39;re making the world a better place.</p>\n\n<p>Even the neckbeard barista who subscribes to <a href=\"/r/LateStageCapitalism\">r/LateStageCapitalism</a> can buy shares in GME, knowing that they will be helping the average American, and cucking the shameless profiteers that seek to destroy American business (Melvin Capital).</p>\n\n<p>Position: 3k GME shares in my Roth IRA</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxns9a/shorts_nearly_cost_42000_gme_employees_their_jobs/","title":"Shorts nearly cost 42,000 GME employees their jobs and livelihoods.
