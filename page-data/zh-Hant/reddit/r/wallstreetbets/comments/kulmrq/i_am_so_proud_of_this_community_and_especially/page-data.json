I believe this demonstrated better leadership than many of our political overlords, and any <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">/r/wallstreetbets</a> mod running for office will have a vote from this retard.</p>\n\n<p>Also looking at the discussion happening on that thread and even in other threads (such as the Daily Discussion ones), I was amazed at how civil, absolutely hilarious, and particularly autistic the discussion was. This reflects the values of our community, and I&#39;m proud of each and every one of you.</p>\n\n<p>I just wanted to make a post to congratulate the mods for doing an amazing work at managing a bunch of retards who sniff more crayons than an Elementary school teacher, and show my appreciation for my fellow retards who managed to find humor in the crazy times we live in.</p>\n\n<p>I am proud to call myself a <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">/r/wallstreetbets</a> retard.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s all I got.</p>\n\n<p>Obligatory Positions:</p>\n\n<p>APHA 1/15 10c - loooooking good.</p>\n\n<p>GOEV 1/15 25c - got ass fucked</p>\n\n<p>ZM 1/15 410c - got ass fucked and had to ride a bicycle home</p>\n\n<p>DKNG 1/21/22 70c - loooooking good</p>\n\n<p>DKNG 1/20/23 90c - loooooking good.</p>\n\n<p>Edit :</p>\n\n<p>Forgot to add 300 shares in GME.To the moon babyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, we&#39;re gonna squeeze the fuck out of Melvin.</p>\n\n<p>Edit #2 :</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the Gold!
