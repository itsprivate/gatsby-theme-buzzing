Needless to say, much like the rest of you, I have spent hours upon hours looking at the trends, shorts, and data since the day of reckoning last month.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And with the jump last week there has been a lot of paper hand BS/ Misinformation being spread</strong> (especially with RKT)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: As someone rightfully pointed to RKT is not bad, just the bots and the public narrative is a bit suspect IMO</p>\n\n<p><strong>To simply put it,</strong> in my opinion, <strong>we are on the verge of something big</strong>...</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL:DR at the bottom for the most atuist</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here is why my fellow tards,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>We have proven the community strength</strong>, A LOT I MEAN A LOT of us have held and held until we were finally seeing some <strong>green</strong> for the first time in weeks. I mean serious green, despite the quote on quote &quot;<strong>Lackluster day</strong>&quot; we are still up <strong>162.5%</strong> the past WEEK!</li>\n<li><strong>A stock with relatively little discussion on this page (IN COMPARISON TO GME) (RKT) is suddenly piking 50,60,70% increase???</strong> Not to knock any fellow apes who invested (hopefully we will see a dump in GME soon after) but <strong>it is so suspicious that a large movement into RKT aligns with the GME rise.</strong> Don&#39;t take my word on this, but we have seen in the past other <strong>&quot;GAMMA SQUEEZE&quot; for fill in the blank as soon as GME has spiked, and what happens after? They fall and fall hard.</strong></li>\n<li>The HF are scared, bad. With news breaking about Melvin and Citadale breaking over the past week, we know <strong>that they have lost billions.</strong> Not only that , they have continued to short the stock with heavy volume. Now with naked shorting, no one knows what the present of the float is exactly, but the estimate remains high.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>SOURCE: Wall Street Journal, 5 days ago.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v59kaj2xapk61.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2530b261ce274a75e989677eb7eb32a7e5fad028\">https://preview.redd.it/v59kaj2xapk61.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2530b261ce274a75e989677eb7eb32a7e5fad028</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Now why you might ask losing roughly 50% of your entire capital important? If you are an autist, and I know you are, let me explain.</strong> I mentioned this in my last post, but essential without capital, <strong>how can HF run effective short latter attacks as we saw after the enormous initial spike? They can&#39;t- or at least we hope- with what we have seen over the past few days, GME has not seen any significant short latter attacks, heck we have gone up $20 alone this week!!! (EVEN WITH THE MARKET SHITTING ITS PANTS)</strong></p>\n\n<p>4) <strong>With contracts being exercised last week at around $55 dollars, we saw a gamma squeeze occur.</strong> Now I have seen 5+ people on here explain wildly differing theories ranging from, if we hit 130 it will trigger the next squeeze, or on 3/15 the squeeze will happen! Now we can all take this with a grain of salt, after all, we are apes. <strong>But what we can do is hold and continue to break resistance, yesterday was $113, today it was $120.</strong> In my opinion, if we continue to rise steadily we can trigger another ITM call and see another squeeze.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/w55we4o6dpk61.png?width=933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e211a49e42220b19f3998f6c764a4dbd428c5bb0\">F ROBINHOOD</a></p>\n\n<p>5) <strong>I know that to your paper hands this will kill you, but if the squeeze never happens GME is a great long-term hold. Here is why:</strong></p>\n\n<p>-They have landed a <strong>huge</strong> multi-year deal with micro soft.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7dvfklepdpk61.png?width=993&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5b6fb6667ffa99e41bb73b473f9ecb0f25e8f9d\">https://preview.redd.it/7dvfklepdpk61.png?width=993&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5b6fb6667ffa99e41bb73b473f9ecb0f25e8f9d</a></p>\n\n<p>-<strong>They fired their insanely incompetent CFO Jim Bell,</strong> seriously look him up dude was a douche.</p>\n\n<p>this shows seriously <strong>promising financial redevelopment for GME.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q5m4zzdjepk61.png?width=939&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44bddf0d683a160630575ae539c13438fff57204\">STILL F ROBINHOOD</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>-<strong>New wave of modernization in the gaming world. As a gamer myself, not to brag, I would love to see GME rise and take over as the ultimate streaming platform, and with the new push for the future and deals that just landed, I think that there is a pretty good chance this will happen.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>TL:DR- IMO I think we have this. There is clear panic on the HF sides, we are up $20 from Monday with a shit ass entire market, there have been no outstanding short latter attacks, HF is down billions with high interest, there is a flood for a &quot;NEW SQUEEZE RKT&quot; (DISTRACTION), we have been stable and we are holding. IMO if we break resistance at 130, there will be some serious momentum.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>IN SORT HOLD THE MF LINES RETARDS- I am not an advisor we just like the stock.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwgbtr/gme_please_read/","title":"GME PLEASE READ","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-03T11:26:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-03 11:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lwgbtr","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwgbtr/gme_please_read/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwgbtr/gme_please_read/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Aric_Holbrook","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Aric_Holbrook","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Aric_Holbrook","score":5891,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME请阅读","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，看猿，我从第一次之前就开始关注GME的趋势了。\n挤压。不用说，和你们其他人一样，我也花了好几个小时的时间\n小时，研究自上个盘点日以来的趋势、空头和数据。\n月。\n\n而随着上周的跳水，已经有不少纸质手...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME請閱讀","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，看猿，我從第一次之前就開始關注GME的趨勢了。\n擠壓。不用說，和你們其他人一樣，我也花了好幾個小時的時間\n小時，研究自上個盤點日以來的趨勢、空頭和數據。\n月。\n\n而隨着上週的跳水，已經有不少紙質手...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m4fytl","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4fytl/inspired_by_the_many_posts_now_on_gorilla/","title":"Inspired by the many posts now on Gorilla adoption, I have also adopted one.
