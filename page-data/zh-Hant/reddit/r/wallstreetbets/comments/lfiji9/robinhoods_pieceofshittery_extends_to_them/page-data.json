This morning I attempted withdrawing my funds from my Robinhood account only to experience two different errors, shown <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/2Ws8qcP\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>One error is about some mysterious additional verification that I need to complete, but with zero ability to initiate that, other than going to their support team. It also suggests the issue is due to the account I was attempting to withdraw to.</p>\n\n<p>So, I tried withdrawing to the other one of my two linked bank accounts, only to receive an &quot;unexpected server error.&quot; The error message suggests trying again later. Well, I&#39;ve tried about 10 different times today and get the same message every time.</p>\n\n<p>It appears to me that RH is making it as difficult as possible for me to move my own money off their shady platform. Is anyone else experiencing this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfiji9/robinhoods_pieceofshittery_extends_to_them/","title":"Robinhood's piece-of-shittery extends to them preventing me from withdrawing my money as I attempt to leave.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T03:39:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 03:39","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lfiji9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfiji9/robinhoods_pieceofshittery_extends_to_them/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfiji9/robinhoods_pieceofshittery_extends_to_them/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/G0Qp93DFXpZIrmYvoTIGzQj1hBzNBBT1AR98GzCS45s.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0b9c7cbec95ba509decaad68c81e5474b9056e87","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Pippyopi","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pippyopi","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Pippyopi","score":4755,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"罗宾汉的一片污言秽语延伸到他们阻止我取钱，因为我试图离开。","the_new_excerpt":"和许多人一样，对Robinhood限制GME购买的行为感到震惊。\n最关键的时候，我很容易就做出了一个决定，那就是放弃这个平台。\n以利于真正的经纪公司（对我来说是富达）。今天上午，我试图\n从我的Robinhood账户中提取资金，却遇到了两个... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"羅賓漢的一片污言穢語延伸到他們阻止我取錢，因爲我試圖離開。","the_new_excerpt":"和許多人一樣，對Robinhood限制GME購買的行爲感到震驚。\n最關鍵的時候，我很容易就做出了一個決定，那就是放棄這個平臺。\n以利於真正的經紀公司（對我來說是富達）。今天上午，我試圖\n從我的Robinhood賬戶中提取資金，卻遇到了兩個... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26184352","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26184352","title":"Uber shuts down app that told drivers if Uber underpaid them","date":"February 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Uber关闭应用程序，告诉司机Uber是否少付了他们的工资。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Uber關閉應用程序，告訴司機Uber是否少付了他們的工資。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26179162","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26179162","title":"Facebook knew for years ad reach estimates were based on ‘wrong data’","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 19, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Facebook多年来一直知道广告到达率的估计是基于 \"错误的数据\"。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Facebook多年來一直知道廣告到達率的估計是基於 \"錯誤的數據\"。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lfiji9","previousId":"HnPost-26184352","nextId":"HnPost-26179162","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfiji9/robinhoods_pieceofshittery_extends_to_them/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
