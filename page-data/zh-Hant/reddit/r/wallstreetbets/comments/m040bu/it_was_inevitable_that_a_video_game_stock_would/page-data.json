In fact, I don&#39;t recommend reading it. I may have eaten too many yellow crayons I thought were bananas this week (Or was I trying to eat yellow crayons but ate bananas? Idr) but I think I stumbled onto something.</p>\n\n<p>Most people on this sub are Millenials (speculation). Most Millenials grew up playing video games. We have a passion for them. But we never really picked up a lot of practical skills from playing video games. <em>Until now</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As we all know, Robinhood and similar apps <strong>game-ified</strong> investing. They made cool colors to show us how we did. It&#39;s not enough to show green and red on the app so the entire fucking screen has to be colored so we know what the fuck is going on. So we could say &quot;Ohhhh green good red bad.&quot; It&#39;s like the slot machine except, unlike slots, investing odds can be changed by doing work. Nobody used to do the work, but now that all the work is on the phone--the same device we have been using to play the game--it still feels like part of the game. </p>\n\n<p>So we do some research and now we actually have a leg up in the game. It&#39;s like when you play StarCraft and you suck but then you read an article on how to not suck at StarCraft. Well, we read posts on GME and we sucked less at predicting the movement on that stock. </p>\n\n<p>Why are video games even fun? None of it is real. But it&#39;s a <strong>shared</strong> experience that you can have with your friends and peers, or, at the very least, discuss with them. It&#39;s the consensus that something cool happened on a screen that makes games fun on a social level, even though it&#39;s all fake. Well none of the money movements we see on the screen are real. Sure, it&#39;s all documented, but it&#39;s still virtual. Nobody&#39;s going to your bank and moving cash into RH&#39;s bank. This all works because we all agree that it works.</p>\n\n<p>Now get a bunch of apes to play the game after reading the rules and even, for some of us, practicing, and you&#39;ve got the beginning of a movement to a new era of trading and investing.</p>\n\n<p>Am I making any sense or am I insane even for a WSBer?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Wow guys! Thank you! I have never received awards before!! I like rockets because I think they are food colored bananas!!! 🚀🚀🚀🍌 🍌 🍌</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m040bu/it_was_inevitable_that_a_video_game_stock_would/","title":"It was inevitable that a video game stock would be the catalyst to change the way investing works forever.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-08T06:34:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-08 06:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m040bu","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m040bu/it_was_inevitable_that_a_video_game_stock_would/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m040bu/it_was_inevitable_that_a_video_game_stock_would/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"permanentburner89","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/permanentburner89","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"permanentburner89","score":3730,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"一只电子游戏股成为永远改变投资方式的催化剂是必然的。","the_new_excerpt":"首先，我想说，下面的帖子完全是胡说八道。事实上，我\n不推荐阅读。我可能是吃了太多的黄色蜡笔，我想。\n是香蕉这个星期（或者是我想吃黄色蜡笔，但吃香蕉？\nIdr）但我认为我偶然发现了一些东西。\n\n大多数人对...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一隻電子遊戲股成爲永遠改變投資方式的催化劑是必然的。","the_new_excerpt":"首先，我想說，下面的帖子完全是胡說八道。事實上，我\n不推薦閱讀。我可能是吃了太多的黃色蠟筆，我想。\n是香蕉這個星期（或者是我想喫黃色蠟筆，但喫香蕉？\nIdr）但我認爲我偶然發現了一些東西。\n\n大多數人對...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26495059","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26495059","title":"Show HN: Video Game in a Font","date":"March 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"显示HN：电子游戏中的字体","locale":"zh"},{"title":"顯示HN：電子遊戲中的字體","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m83hla","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m83hla/tomorrow_may_go_to_500_700_maybe_1000_keep/","title":"tomorrow may go to 500, 700 maybe 1000, keep holding no matter what, the squeeze is going to last, for at least 2 weeks, we not going to miss that rocket","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 19, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"明天可能会到500，700也许1000，无论如何都要继续持有，压榨会持续，至少2周，我们不会错过那枚火箭","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"明天可能會到500，700也許1000，無論如何都要繼續持有，壓榨會持續，至少2周，我們不會錯過那枚火箭","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m040bu","previousId":"HnPost-26495059","nextId":"RedditPost-m83hla","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m040bu/it_was_inevitable_that_a_video_game_stock_would/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
