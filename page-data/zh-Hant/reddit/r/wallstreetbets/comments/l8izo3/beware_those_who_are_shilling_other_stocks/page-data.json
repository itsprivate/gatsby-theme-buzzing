As our beloved autist Michael Burry said, GME is a unique situation and a perfect storm. You won&#39;t find something like this again.

Half the comments are from new accounts with just a handful of karma. AMC is not the next GME. The &#39;days to cover&#39; on AMC is less than a day. After an initial uptick it will just fizzle out and you&#39;ll be left bagholding.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re still unsure, <a href=\"https://www.nextmemestock.com/\">here</a> you can find a highly advanced AI algorithm showing the next meme stock.
