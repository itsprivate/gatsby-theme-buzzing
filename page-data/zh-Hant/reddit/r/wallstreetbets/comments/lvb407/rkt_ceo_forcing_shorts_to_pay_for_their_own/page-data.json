Weve arrived at the BDE moment..</p>\n\n<p><strong>SHORTS HAVE TO PAY THE DIVIDEND</strong></p>\n\n<p>Shorts have to pay $1.11 for every share they are short on 3/9</p>\n\n<p>BUYBACK PROGRAM</p>\n\n<p>What else was in that juicy investor conference? Wait for it…</p>\n\n<p><strong>$1 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK PROGRAM</strong></p>\n\n<p>See, RKT makes so much fucking money they can afford not only a special divi, but a $1B share buyback. Im telling you this man is going into the trenches and clearing the shorts out by his fucking self.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>\n\n<p>$RKT has been suppressed for way too fuckin long, the company owns 95% of the shares and Jay Farner/Dan Gilbert hate shorts and they have diamond fuckin nuts, they aint sellin. Shorts have to cover their 43mm shares or they are <strong>forced to pay $1.11/share they are short on 3/9</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you can’t do math. If u buy shares and hold thru 3/9.. it’s an instant 5% return via the special dividend.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb407/rkt_ceo_forcing_shorts_to_pay_for_their_own/","title":"$RKT - CEO Forcing Shorts to Pay for Their Own Squeeze by 3/9","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-01T19:19:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-01 19:19","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lvb407","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb407/rkt_ceo_forcing_shorts_to_pay_for_their_own/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb407/rkt_ceo_forcing_shorts_to_pay_for_their_own/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/mWBb5xFtsvba0irS6SLmwL8JBRZXvYCDcHb0oQ3efck.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0c6e091c3d6f0a857b266e5f38cafe8d2022d917","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"tendeeznuts","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/tendeeznuts","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"tendeeznuts","score":8960,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$RKT - CEO迫使空头为自己的挤压付出代价3/9。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，$RKT首席执行官杰伊-法纳他妈的讨厌短裤 几乎和我们一样多，和我要去\n勾勒出这个绝对的CHAD对他们的计划。\n\n他的公司RKT抵押贷款从字面上粉碎每一个ER的国家英里和他的\n厌倦了他的股票被这些没有骨气的懦夫们压制。法纳是\n积极","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$RKT - CEO迫使空頭爲自己的擠壓付出代價3/9。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，$RKT首席執行官傑伊-法納他媽的討厭短褲 幾乎和我們一樣多，和我要去\n勾勒出這個絕對的CHAD對他們的計劃。\n\n他的公司RKT抵押貸款從字面上粉碎每一個ER的國家英里和他的\n厭倦了他的股票被這些沒有骨氣的懦夫們壓制。法納是\n積極","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m2hdvl","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2hdvl/never_give_upnever_surrender/","title":"Never Give Up....Never Surrender","date":"March 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"永不放弃....，永不投降","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"永不放棄....，永不投降","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m2z9w9","excerpt":"So I bought 20 AMD options last week(.50 cents/share), May 2021 $95 strike, when\nAMD has been at bottom.
