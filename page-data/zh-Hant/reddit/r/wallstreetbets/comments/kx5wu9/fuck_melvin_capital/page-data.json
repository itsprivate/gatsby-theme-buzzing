Let me remind you.</p>\n\n<p>Melvin Capital bet that GameStop would go bankrupt. If it had, those assholes would&#39;ve been dancing in their New York offices, popping champagne and laughing, completely aware of the damage they were rejoicing in. They tried to capitalize on a global pandemic as the final nail in the coffin for yet another retail company that wouldn&#39;t change.</p>\n\n<p>On the other side, things would&#39;ve been pretty grim. GameStop workers make, what, slightly more than minimum wage? They are probably completely unaware of companies like Melvin Capital who hope their employer goes out of business. They&#39;re just trying to make a buck.</p>\n\n<p>Not this time.</p>\n\n<p>GameStop may have an outdated business model that hasn&#39;t adapted to 2011, let alone 2021, but it&#39;s an American institution. Every single one of us has walked into a GameStop at least once and bought a game we were excited about. Our little brothers and sisters would beg us to take them there to buy the 80th edition of Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow/Gold/whatever. We&#39;ve all perused a Game Informer, hoping to see a 10 rating. You can shit on them for charging too much or not paying enough for a used game, but you don&#39;t hope their people go on unemployment.</p>\n\n<p>So Melvin Capital and short sellers (lol <a href=\"https://i.redd.it/wxohwokyrab61.jpg\">Frankfurt School Associates</a>) can go fuck themselves. Go read about these assholes if you want to put a smile on your face, knowing what they&#39;re dealing with right now. I hope Gabriel Plotkin has to sell his $40 million Miami mansion (he just bought it in December). Hell, I hope Ryan Cohen buys it from him.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Positions</strong>: Half my Roth IRA in GME shares. A few calls. Just like a lot of you, not enough to really make a difference. But together we can slay giants.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exit Strategy</strong>: I have no sell orders. I&#39;ll sell when someone posts a story about Melvin Capital going bankrupt. Fuck em.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t fucking sell.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx5wu9/fuck_melvin_capital/","title":"Fuck Melvin Capital","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-14T17:19:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-14 17:19","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kx5wu9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx5wu9/fuck_melvin_capital/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx5wu9/fuck_melvin_capital/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/hwQdRvsPzCDPvdctJ63R2q2snOHmZ4wkzXevlpCo_do.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4d2f0a3391079c941540e2a425bff3d585661afb","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"landmanpgh","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/landmanpgh","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"landmanpgh","score":2504,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"他妈的梅尔文资本","the_new_excerpt":"我知道这里的每个人都对GME股票感到兴奋，但你真的坐下来了吗？\n并想过我们的对手是谁，是什么？让我提醒你\n\nMelvin Capital打赌GameStop会破产。如果它破产了 那些混蛋\n会一直在他们的纽约办公室跳舞， 弹出香槟和... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"他媽的梅爾文資本","the_new_excerpt":"我知道這裏的每個人都對GME股票感到興奮，但你真的坐下來了嗎？\n並想過我們的對手是誰，是什麼？讓我提醒你\n\nMelvin Capital打賭GameStop會破產。如果它破產了 那些混蛋\n會一直在他們的紐約辦公室跳舞， 彈出香檳和... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kx6mkw","excerpt":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/teslas-model-y-wins-5-star-rating-from-nhtsa\n\nThe NHTSA grades vehicles based on a series of scenarios, including frontal\ncrashes, with subcategories for the driver and passenger seats, side crashes\ninvolving poles and barriers, and a rollover.
