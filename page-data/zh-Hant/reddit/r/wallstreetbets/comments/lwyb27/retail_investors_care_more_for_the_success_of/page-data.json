But back among AMC&#39;s long-standing investor base of Wall Street players, there was money to be made. Silver Lake, which held a $600 million investment in the company&#39;s bonds, immediately capitalized on the rally by converting the debt into equity and liquidating its entire position, capturing a $113 million profit.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>When I read this I was really pissed, until I read on and saw what it meant for AMC . . .  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Silver Lake&#39;s quick decision amounted to a material gain for AMC. &#39;It was immediately beneficial...cause we got rid of $600 million of debt,&#39; Mr. Aron said.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Mr. Mahmoodzagedan, AMC&#39;s investment banker, said, &#39;The retail investor (that&#39;s you beautiful smoothbrained retards)  clearly had more faith in the long-term viability of this company than a lot of the institutional investors did.&#39; That, he said &#39;gave the company a major life-line. The retail investor really helped create that bridge to a post-pandemic future.&#39;&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>Remember this for when they haul you in front of a Senate Inquiry like they did DFV. &quot;We save American companies. Wall Street short sellers destroy them. I am not a cat. I am the savior of American businesses.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwyb27/retail_investors_care_more_for_the_success_of/","title":"Retail investors care more for the success of American businesses than Wall Street","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-04T00:57:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-04 00:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lwyb27","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwyb27/retail_investors_care_more_for_the_success_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwyb27/retail_investors_care_more_for_the_success_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"OrderingTacos","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/OrderingTacos","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"OrderingTacos","score":8614,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"与华尔街相比，散户投资者更关心美国企业的成功。","the_new_excerpt":"来自周六《华尔街日报》关于AMC的文章。\n\n\"当AMC的股价在第二天飙升时，日间交易员们互相劝告，不要再买了\n来销售，在社交媒体上闪现钻石手的图片，以示。\n承诺的力度。但回到AMC的长期投资人群体之中\n华尔街的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"與華爾街相比，散戶投資者更關心美國企業的成功。","the_new_excerpt":"來自週六《華爾街日報》關於AMC的文章。\n\n\"當AMC的股價在第二天飆升時，日間交易員們互相勸告，不要再買了\n來銷售，在社交媒體上閃現鑽石手的圖片，以示。\n承諾的力度。但回到AMC的長期投資人羣體之中\n華爾街的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26456524","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26456524","title":"Refund of pre-installed Windows: Lenovo must pay 20k euros in damages","date":"March 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"退还预装Windows。联想必须赔偿2万欧元损失","locale":"zh"},{"title":"退還預裝Windows。聯想必須賠償2萬歐元損失","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m4n8k2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4n8k2/twitter_wow_we_are_overwhelmed_by_the_support_we/","title":"[Twitter] Wow!
