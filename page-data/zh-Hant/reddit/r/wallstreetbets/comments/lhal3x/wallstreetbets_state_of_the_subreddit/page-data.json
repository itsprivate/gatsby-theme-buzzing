We are all here for a single reason: To make money on high risk plays.</p>\n\n<p>Gains made overnight, or by holding through hell and high water, are to be equally celebrated. </p>\n\n<p>Losses should be mocked, derided, and if unique enough, given the high honor of being put into automod.</p>\n\n<p>At all costs, if we are to remain different than the rest of reddit, we must avoid the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Politics, we&#39;re not here to change the world (sorry) - we just like the stock.</p></li>\n<li><p>Divisiveness, calling people bots and shills because they disagree with you only reduces diversity of thought, and drives away our best members.</p></li>\n<li><p>Repetitive content, we have just barely enough IQ points to focus on multiple stocks at once, not everything has to be GME or Weedstocks.</p></li>\n<li><p>Know it alls, remember rule 7 - &quot;No Bullshitting&quot;. Stay humble and ask about what you don&#39;t know. After being insulted a few times, someone will help you out.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>What you can do to keep this place great</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Upvote new and interesting ideas. No one wants to see the front page filled with threads on the same stock or sector.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mock people for not understanding something and doing their research, and don&#39;t speak beyond your knowledge.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bring your own creative ideas to the table! Pick the dumbest company (over $1B market cap) and really read into their filings and let us know what you find!</p></li>\n<li><p>Keep content related to megathread topics in the megathread.</p></li>\n<li><p>Don&#39;t ask &quot;what the next move is&quot; - WSB is not your personal army, there is no agenda, no one speaks for WSB, and we don&#39;t &quot;pump and dump&quot; anything. Simply, we are a watering hole for risk loving individuals.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>What we&#39;re doing to keep this place great</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The whole mod team has been working overtime, clearing out low quality content and keeping things fresh. Less than 1% of threads make it out of /new.</p></li>\n<li><p>In the absence of <a href=\"/u/zjz\">u/zjz</a>&#39;s incredible bots, we&#39;re building new tools to assist with moderation efforts, but remain hopeful that zjz can return soon.</p></li>\n<li><p>We&#39;re planning some fun community events. Can&#39;t say too much, but those of you who have been around will know. Guess we&#39;ll have to wait and see.</p></li>\n<li><p>We will be reintroducing stickied DD threads. These will be automatically stickied based on flair, with high account age restrictions.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Why was my post/comment removed? CORRUPT!</h1>\n\n<p>Over the past week, there were multiple <em>really good</em> DDs and YOLOs on PRPL, FNKO, SNDL, and many other stocks. The kind of stuff that gives you hope that the old WSB is very much alive.</p>\n\n<p>But you may have missed them because the front page was dominated with GME related talk. </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t let the bandwagoners steal your fresh DD. Downvote spam and low effort posts, upvote innovative posts.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>A note on the moderation team:</h1>\n\n<p>The team we currently have (missing you <a href=\"/u/zjz\">u/zjz</a>) is the best we&#39;ve ever had. Everyone on this team is entirely committed to keeping the subreddit stable and top notch.</p>\n\n<p>This mod team is a completely different beast than the two mod teams evicted over the past year. They are the ones who have actually put work into the subreddit over the years, and aren&#39;t just inactive. They have poured their souls into this sub for years. Yes, some are using throwaways because they&#39;d rather not get doxxed (again), but if my vouch isn&#39;t enough, <a href=\"/u/zjz\">u/zjz</a> vouched for them as well.</p>\n\n<p>Making everyone a mod for a week, paper trading competitions, automod responses, the discord and plenty of other fun facets of the subreddit were done by this very team. If you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about at this point, stick around. You&#39;ll have a blast.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Dear SEC Intern: We don&#39;t endorse any tickers or movements. We&#39;re just here to trade and make dick jokes.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhal3x/wallstreetbets_state_of_the_subreddit/","title":"Wallstreetbets State of the Subreddit","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-11T05:27:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-11 05:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lhal3x","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhal3x/wallstreetbets_state_of_the_subreddit/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhal3x/wallstreetbets_state_of_the_subreddit/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR","score":18568,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Wallstreetbets状态的subreddit(华尔街日报)","the_new_excerpt":"Wallstreetbets在reddit上是独一无二的，因为它的... ... \"文化\"。我们都在这里\n只有一个原因。赚取高风险游戏的钱。\n\n一夜之间获得的收益，或通过地狱和高水位的持有，是为了让你的生活更美好。\n同样值得庆祝。\n\n失败应该被嘲笑，被贬低，如果足够独特，给... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Wallstreetbets狀態的subreddit(華爾街日報)","the_new_excerpt":"Wallstreetbets在reddit上是獨一無二的，因爲它的... ... \"文化\"。我們都在這裏\n只有一個原因。賺取高風險遊戲的錢。\n\n一夜之間獲得的收益，或通過地獄和高水位的持有，是爲了讓你的生活更美好。\n同樣值得慶祝。\n\n失敗應該被嘲笑，被貶低，如果足夠獨特，給... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lp04c5","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lp04c5/cant_wait_to_delete_my_robinhood_account_because/","title":"Can’t wait to delete my Robinhood Account because how much they suck... and not because I have lost all my money...","date":"February 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"迫不及待地想删除我的Robinhood账户，因为他们有多烂......而不是因为我失去了所有的钱......。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"迫不及待地想刪除我的Robinhood賬戶，因爲他們有多爛......而不是因爲我失去了所有的錢......。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-26214593","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26214593","title":"Formalising Mathematics: An Introduction","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 22, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"形式化数学。介紹","locale":"zh"},{"title":"形式化數學。介紹","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lhal3x","previousId":"RedditPost-lp04c5","nextId":"HnPost-26214593","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhal3x/wallstreetbets_state_of_the_subreddit/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
