Both the situation I describe and the well known pump-and-dump scheme both rely on generating the kind of &quot;mass transaction&quot; that leads to a self-fulfilling goal (the pump and dump by way of driving prices up with high volume buys, and coordinated short-selling by driving prices down with high volume shorts / stock sales).</p>\n\n<p>If either my assessment of large-scale short selling OR hedge fun involvement in said endeavor is inaccurate, please help me fill in the gaps. My perception so far of hedge fund involvement in the market in this capacity is that of foul play to the extent that it hurts U.S. business, investors, and those employed by the companies they allegedly prey on. Alternatively if my assessment is accurate, how is this not illegal / not viewed differently from pump-and-dumps?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l405i7/how_is_a_massivelycoordinated_shortsale_operation/","title":"How is a \"massively-coordinated\" short-sale operation different, fundamentally, from a pump and dump scheme?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-24T21:41:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-24 21:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l405i7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l405i7/how_is_a_massivelycoordinated_shortsale_operation/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l405i7/how_is_a_massivelycoordinated_shortsale_operation/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"InfiniteDeathsticks","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/InfiniteDeathsticks","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"InfiniteDeathsticks","score":60,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"\"大规模协调 \"的卖空操作与抽水倒卖计划有什么本质区别？","the_new_excerpt":"我希望这个问题在这里发布是正确的。\n\n随着最近对冲基金被曝出与GME的情况下\n(我只能把它描述为对冲基金的协调卖空努力。)\n资金针对目标公司），我有以下问题。如果有...\n某个门槛...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"大規模協調 \"的賣空操作與抽水倒賣計劃有什麼本質區別？","the_new_excerpt":"我希望這個問題在這裏發佈是正確的。\n\n隨着最近對沖基金被曝出與GME的情況下\n(我只能把它描述爲對沖基金的協調賣空努力。)\n資金針對目標公司），我有以下問題。如果有...\n某個門檻...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-laferl","excerpt":"Dear SEC and President Biden,\n\nI am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of\nSecurity Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that\nartificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of\nthe laws of the United States.\n\nSection…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laferl/15_usca_78i_the_illegality_of_short_ladder/","title":"15 U.S.C.A. § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight)","date":"February 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"《美国法典》第15章第78i节 -- -- 短梯攻击的非法性(法律见解)","the_new_excerpt":"亲爱的证监会和拜登总统，\n\n我今天根据《美国法典》第15卷第78i条，题为 \"操纵 \"的规定，给你打电话。\n证券价格，禁止采取操纵和欺骗性的手段，以达到提高证券价格的目的。\n人为地压低GME和AMC证券的价格，违反了。\n美国的法律。\n\n第...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"《美國法典》第15章第78i節 -- -- 短梯攻擊的非法性(法律見解)","the_new_excerpt":"親愛的證監會和拜登總統，\n\n我今天根據《美國法典》第15卷第78i條，題爲 \"操縱 \"的規定，給你打電話。\n證券價格，禁止採取操縱和欺騙性的手段，以達到提高證券價格的目的。\n人爲地壓低GME和AMC證券的價格，違反了。\n美國的法律。\n\n第...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1356268925303066626","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1356268925303066626","title":"Inflation Expectations in the US rise to their highest levels since 2013: 2.21% (5-year breakeven). https://t.co/WOI5meRF4R","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 02, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国的通胀预期升至2013年以来的最高水平：2.21%（5年盈亏平衡）。https://t.co/WOI5meRF4R。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國的通脹預期升至2013年以來的最高水平：2.21%（5年盈虧平衡）。https://t.co/WOI5meRF4R。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l405i7","previousId":"RedditPost-laferl","nextId":"TweetPost-1356268925303066626","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l405i7/how_is_a_massivelycoordinated_shortsale_operation/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
