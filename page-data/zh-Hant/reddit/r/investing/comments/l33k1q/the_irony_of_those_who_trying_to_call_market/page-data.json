Yet, he owns Quantum Scape which went public via SPAC. The company has no plan to generate any revenue until 2024-2025. I&#39;m sure he has been rewarded handsomely, but being an early investor has restricted him to sell shares to the public until lock up expiration. So all he can do right now is watching his investment goes up and down in wild swings.</p>\n\n<p>Irony 2: He is an advocated green energy investors. He has called out Tesla a bubble, which many by the time now know. He was wondering why the market hasn&#39;t taken notices to his green energy investments for 10 years. That was until Tesla showed up of course. The fact of his EVs&#39; and other green energies companies&#39; valuation are going into bubble territory is exactly because of Tesla&#39;s leading the charge. Perhaps he should sell some of those investments if he thinks those are in the bubbles as well?</p>\n\n<p>You have many other examples. Even legendary investor Warren Buffet, who advocated &quot;Be greedy when others are fearful,&quot; was very fearful just like every other human beings during the COVID crash in February &amp; March of 2020. Berkshire was not executing its strategy and sold many of its holding at rock bottom. If Buffet was brave at that moment like he did during the financial crisis of 2008, I&#39;m sure Berkshire&#39;s stock would outperform the market by a large margin by now.</p>\n\n<p>Moral of the story: Listen to what people said, <strong>but pay attention to what they actually DO.</strong> No one knows when the bubble may pop. If you&#39;re thinking long term, just stay the course. You will ride through bubble pops and still come up on tops in the end if you&#39;re investing in good companies.</p>\n\n<p>Fun fact: Fidelity has done yearly studies of their clients&#39; accounts performance, for many years. The best performing portfolio? Well, Fidelity found out those account holders were no longer living in this world, so &quot;Hold-onto dare Life&quot; until your dick dries up.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l33k1q/the_irony_of_those_who_trying_to_call_market/","title":"The Irony of Those Who Trying To Call Market Bubbles","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-24T00:29:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-24 00:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l33k1q","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l33k1q/the_irony_of_those_who_trying_to_call_market/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l33k1q/the_irony_of_those_who_trying_to_call_market/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"07Ghost","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/07Ghost","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"07Ghost","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"那些试图叫嚣市场泡沫的人的讽刺行为","the_new_excerpt":"杰里米-格兰瑟姆，一个价值投资者，警告他的客户，他终于开始。\n看到部分市场的泡沫形成，它随时会破灭。\n[https://www.gmo.com/asia/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/] 他说\n出了很多原因，为什么他看到的结局是近在咫尺，却...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"那些試圖叫囂市場泡沫的人的諷刺行爲","the_new_excerpt":"傑里米-格蘭瑟姆，一個價值投資者，警告他的客戶，他終於開始。\n看到部分市場的泡沫形成，它隨時會破滅。\n[https://www.gmo.com/asia/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/] 他說\n出了很多原因，爲什麼他看到的結局是近在咫尺，卻...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25987314","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25987314","title":"Internet disrupted in Myanmar amid military coup","date":"February 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"缅甸发生军事政变，互联网中断。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"緬甸發生軍事政變，互聯網中斷。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l9rk78","excerpt":"Obligatory emoji 🚀\n\nShort Version: The short version is that a review of the 'strategic\nfails–to–deliver' data indicates that institutional insiders may have\ncounterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to\nstop retail investors from buying more shares on…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/","title":"SEC, DOJ, 60 Minutes – Public data suggests massive securities fraud in which hedge funds and institutions have created more Gamestop shares than actually exist for delivery","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 01, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"美国证券交易委员会，司法部，60分钟--公开数据表明，大规模的证券欺诈，其中对冲基金和机构创造了比实际存在的交付更多的Gamestop股票。","the_new_excerpt":"必需的表情符号 🚀。\n\n简版。简言之，就是对 \"战略 \"的审查。\n未能兑现 \"的数据显示，机构内部人士可能已经\n假冒了大量的Gamestop股票，这就是为什么他们试图\n阻止散户买入更多的股票，在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國證券交易委員會，司法部，60分鐘--公開數據表明，大規模的證券欺詐，其中對沖基金和機構創造了比實際存在的交付更多的Gamestop股票。","the_new_excerpt":"必需的表情符號 🚀。\n\n簡版。簡言之，就是對 \"戰略 \"的審查。\n未能兌現 \"的數據顯示，機構內部人士可能已經\n假冒了大量的Gamestop股票，這就是爲什麼他們試圖\n阻止散戶買入更多的股票，在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l33k1q","previousId":"HnPost-25987314","nextId":"RedditPost-l9rk78","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l33k1q/the_irony_of_those_who_trying_to_call_market/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
