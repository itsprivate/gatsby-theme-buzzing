As part of the policy, which was duly approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lfb5jt/tesla_tsla_bought_15_billion_worth_of_bitcoin_btc/","title":"Tesla (TSLA) bought 1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC)","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-08T14:43:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-08 14:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lfb5jt","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lfb5jt/tesla_tsla_bought_15_billion_worth_of_bitcoin_btc/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lfb5jt/tesla_tsla_bought_15_billion_worth_of_bitcoin_btc/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"PomeloWarrior","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PomeloWarrior","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"PomeloWarrior","score":6102,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"特斯拉（TSLA）买入价值15亿的比特币（BTC）。","the_new_excerpt":"> 2021年1月，我们更新了投资政策，为我们提供了更多的。\n> 灵活性，以进一步分散和最大限度地提高我们的现金回报，而这些现金并不在我们手中。\n> 需要保持足够的经营流动性。作为该政策的一部分。\n> 经本公司董事会审计委员会正式批准，... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉（TSLA）買入價值15億的比特幣（BTC）。","the_new_excerpt":"> 2021年1月，我們更新了投資政策，爲我們提供了更多的。\n> 靈活性，以進一步分散和最大限度地提高我們的現金回報，而這些現金並不在我們手中。\n> 需要保持足夠的經營流動性。作爲該政策的一部分。\n> 經本公司董事會審計委員會正式批准，... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26174480","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26174480","title":"Bitfinex, the Italian network behind the boss that makes Bitcoin tremble","date":"February 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"让比特币颤抖的背后老板意大利网络Bitfinex","locale":"zh"},{"title":"讓比特幣顫抖的背後老闆意大利網絡Bitfinex","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lmewlu","excerpt":"Hopefully everyone having a good day.
