ARK is forced to sell its holdings whenever its liquid ETF gets hit with outflows as is especially the case in market downturns. This could force very painful liquidations at unfavorable prices and the ensuing crash goes into a positive feedback loop leading into a death spiral enticing even more outflows and predatory shorts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lsgahw/ark_etfs_implosion_risk/","title":"ARK ETFs implosion risk ------------------------","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-25T22:26:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-25 22:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lsgahw","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lsgahw/ark_etfs_implosion_risk/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lsgahw/ark_etfs_implosion_risk/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Whiskerfield","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Whiskerfield","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Whiskerfield","score":98,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ARK ETF内爆风险 ------------------------","the_new_excerpt":"鉴于近期股市的低迷，尤其是科技股的低迷，这很可能会影响股市的发展。\n随着收益率的不断上升，我认为应该谨慎地分享一下\n投资ARK ETF的风险，《熊穴》写得非常好。\n[https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/special-edition-will-ark-invest-blow]....","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ARK ETF內爆風險 ------------------------","the_new_excerpt":"鑑於近期股市的低迷，尤其是科技股的低迷，這很可能會影響股市的發展。\n隨着收益率的不斷上升，我認爲應該謹慎地分享一下\n投資ARK ETF的風險，《熊穴》寫得非常好。\n[https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/special-edition-will-ark-invest-blow]....","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lscure","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lscure/america_meet_gamestop_were_not_fucking_leaving/","title":"America, Meet GameStop: WE'RE NOT FUCKING LEAVING 💎🙌💎 FOR LIFE","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"美国，迎接GameStop：我们不会他妈的离开💎🙌💎终身。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國，迎接GameStop：我們不會他媽的離開💎🙌💎終身。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ls8u0y","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls8u0y/bloomberg_gme_shortsellers_estimated_to_have_lost/","title":"[Bloomberg] $GME Short-sellers estimated to have lost $818,000,000 on their bearish bets on Wednesday.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 25, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"[彭博]$GME空头估计在周三的看空押注中损失了8.18亿美元。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"[彭博]$GME空頭估計在週三的看空押注中損失了8.18億美元。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lsgahw","previousId":"RedditPost-lscure","nextId":"RedditPost-ls8u0y","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lsgahw/ark_etfs_implosion_risk/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
