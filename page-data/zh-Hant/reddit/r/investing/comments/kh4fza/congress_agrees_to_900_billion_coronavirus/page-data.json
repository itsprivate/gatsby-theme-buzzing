He did not delve into many details. Congressional leaders have not yet released text of the more than $2 trillion legislation, which they hope to pass in the coming hours.</p>\n\n<p>The agreement follows months of sniping on Capitol Hill over how best to fight a once-in-a-century crisis. A new round of aid cannot come soon enough for the millions of Americans who have tried to scrape together enough money to afford food and housing.</p>\n\n<p>The $900 billion coronavirus relief plan under negotiation on Capitol Hill was set to include direct payments of $600 to many adults. Some families were also expected to get $600 per child.</p>\n\n<p>The proposal was set to put at least $300 billion into small business assistance including Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would also add a $300 federal unemployment supplement and temporarily keep in place pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility.</p>\n\n<p>If those provisions expire the day after Christmas, 12 million people will lose unemployment benefits.</p>\n\n<p>The measure was also set to put critical funding into the distribution of the two FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Health-care workers and top government officials have started to receive shots, and widespread inoculation in the coming months will help the world to emerge from the pandemic’s shadow.</p>\n\n<p>The rescue package was also set to send relief to hospitals, many of which have struggled to keep up with a flood of Covid-19 patients. It was also expected to put new money into education and transportation.</p>\n\n<p>As lawmakers finally reach a deal, the help comes too late for the nearly 8 million people estimated to have fallen into poverty since June. Many in Congress say the proposal will not go nearly far enough to address the scope of the health and economic crisis.</p>\n\n<p>Progressives and some Republicans have pushed for larger direct payments and retroactive federal unemployment payments. A $600 weekly supplement that buoyed millions of jobless Americans in the early months of the pandemic expired over the summer, and it took Congress months to agree to reinstate it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kh4fza/congress_agrees_to_900_billion_coronavirus/","title":"Congress agrees to $900 billion coronavirus stimulus deal, McConnell says","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 21, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-21T00:30:25.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-21 00:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kh4fza","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kh4fza/congress_agrees_to_900_billion_coronavirus/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kh4fza/congress_agrees_to_900_billion_coronavirus/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"hom6872","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/hom6872","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"hom6872","score":1393,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"麦康奈尔说，国会同意9000亿美元的冠状病毒刺激协议","the_new_excerpt":"链接\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/20/mcconnell-says-congress-has-agreed-to-900-billion-coronavirus-stimulus-deal.html?utm_content=Main&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR2uRFFTS_C1F32Pn2swO-ha4pde1W0MUJWq8RZywN_54slLZ-vuG98R7no#Echobox=1608504254]\n\n国会达成协议的关键点…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"麥康奈爾說，國會同意9000億美元的冠狀病毒刺激協議","the_new_excerpt":"鏈接\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/20/mcconnell-says-congress-has-agreed-to-900-billion-coronavirus-stimulus-deal.html?utm_content=Main&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR2uRFFTS_C1F32Pn2swO-ha4pde1W0MUJWq8RZywN_54slLZ-vuG98R7no#Echobox=1608504254]\n\n國會達成協議的關鍵點…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1346811667871576065","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1346811667871576065","title":"This scenario is now a higher probability than it's been in years:\n\nhigher GDP growth (from increased govt spending)\n\nhigher inflation\n\nhigher rates\n\ntech stocks finally underperform\n\nsmall caps &amp; value stocks outperform\n\nwho says no?","date":"January 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"这种情况现在的可能性比过去几年都要高：\n\n更高的GDP增长(来自增加的政府支出)\n\n更高的通货膨胀率\n\n更高的费率\n\nTech股票最终表现不佳\n\n小盘股&A；VALUE股票跑赢大盘\n\n谁说不呢？","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"這種情況現在的可能性比過去幾年都要高：\n\n更高的GDP增長(來自增加的政府支出)\n\n更高的通貨膨脹率\n\n更高的費率\n\nTech股票最終表現不佳\n\n小盤股&A；VALUE股票跑贏大盤\n\n誰說不呢？","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-25655423","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25655423","title":"Jim Keller moves to AI chip startup","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 06, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"吉姆·凯勒转投AI芯片初创公司","locale":"zh"},{"title":"吉姆·凱勒轉投AI芯片初創公司","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kh4fza","previousId":"TweetPost-1346811667871576065","nextId":"HnPost-25655423","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kh4fza/congress_agrees_to_900_billion_coronavirus/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
