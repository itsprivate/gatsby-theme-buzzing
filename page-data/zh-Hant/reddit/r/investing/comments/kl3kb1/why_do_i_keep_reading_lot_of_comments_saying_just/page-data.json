This is actually a great way of investing praised by some of the best investors. And one I recommend some of my friends an family.</p>\n\n<p>But my point is, if one has chosen to do this, why on Earth are they still reading <a href=\"/r/investing\">r/investing</a> every single day and commenting that quote every minute.</p>\n\n<p>In my case, the reason why I avoided passive investing was the fact that I love researching and reading about companies, and I don&#39;t see myself without doing it.</p>\n\n<p>So, why do lot passive investors keep reading &amp; commenting all individual stock analysis posts?</p>\n\n<p>PS I&#39;m not a hater, I&#39;m just curious why they do it. IMO they do it because they keep questioning if they really want to stick with passive investing, but I could be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>PS2 sorry I&#39;m advance for my English, it&#39;s not my first language :/</p>\n\n<p>Have a great day!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kl3kb1/why_do_i_keep_reading_lot_of_comments_saying_just/","title":"Why do I keep reading lot of comments saying \"just stick to the SP500's ETF and DCA\"?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 27, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-27T17:49:59.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-27 17:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kl3kb1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kl3kb1/why_do_i_keep_reading_lot_of_comments_saying_just/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kl3kb1/why_do_i_keep_reading_lot_of_comments_saying_just/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Dagoru95","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dagoru95","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Dagoru95","score":300,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么我一直看到很多评论说“只要坚持标准普尔500指数的ETF和DCA就好了”？","the_new_excerpt":"各位投资者好，\n\n我已经投资了几年，阅读了很多资源，包括Reddit\nr/投资[/r/投资]。\n\n问题是，当我读到每一条线索时，我总是感到惊讶。\n“嘿，伙计，只要坚持标准普尔500指数ETF和DCA就行了。”\n\n我是说，很明显人们选择了…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼我一直看到很多評論說“只要堅持標準普爾500指數的ETF和DCA就好了”？","the_new_excerpt":"各位投資者好，\n\n我已經投資了幾年，閱讀了很多資源，包括Reddit\nr/投資[/r/投資]。\n\n問題是，當我讀到每一條線索時，我總是感到驚訝。\n“嘿，夥計，只要堅持標準普爾500指數ETF和DCA就行了。”\n\n我是說，很明顯人們選擇了…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25753166","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25753166","title":"Computer Science Curriculum in 1000 YouTube Videos","date":"January 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"计算机科学课程在1000个YouTube视频中","locale":"zh"},{"title":"計算機科學課程在1000個YouTube視頻中","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-25749492","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25749492","title":"Show HN: Amplication – Instantly Generate Node.js Apps with GraphQL and REST API","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 13, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"HN新产品：Amplication - 使用GraphQL和REST API即时生成Node.js应用。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"HN新產品：Amplication - 使用GraphQL和REST API即時生成Node.js應用。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kl3kb1","previousId":"HnPost-25753166","nextId":"HnPost-25749492","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kl3kb1/why_do_i_keep_reading_lot_of_comments_saying_just/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
