I have seen these misconceptions spread here, on Seeking Alpha and also places like Motley Fool. So I have read in detail the SEC filing here <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577552/000104746919006309/a2240097z424b5.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577552/000104746919006309/a2240097z424b5.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>by Alibaba Group Holding Limited, incorporated in Cayman Islands, for their HK listing and am ready to clarify some of the BS that is being spread.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THERE IS ZERO MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HK AND NYSE SHARES.</strong> A lot of people spread the nonsense that the American ADS&#39;s give you &quot;a mere economic ownership of a VIE&quot; whereas the HK listing gives you &quot;direct ownership of the company&quot;. They then acted &quot;shocked&quot; that there is almost no difference between the price of the two, and act like this indicated that the market fails to appreciate the VIE risk (I saw this crap being written in a Motley Fool article). This is wrong on so many levels. Here is why:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>THE SHARES ON THE TWO DIFFERENT LISTINGS ARE FULLY FUNGIBLE.</strong> You can convert each  American ADSs directly to 8 HK shares. The process for doing this is listed here in the SEC <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577552/000104746919006309/a2240097z424b5.htm#de15203_conversion_between_adss_and_ordinary_shares\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577552/000104746919006309/a2240097z424b5.htm#de15203_conversion_between_adss_and_ordinary_shares</a> Note that this is <em>completely fucking standard</em> for ADSs. For example, Tencent (also a VIE) has a listing in HK and also has a very popular ADS available OTC in the US.</li>\n<li><strong>THE ABOVE FACT MAKES THE TWO SHARES FUNCTIONALLY EQUIVALENT.</strong> The instant there is a meaningful price difference between the American and HK shares, any arbitrageur can buy the cheaper one and sell the more expensive one. How hard is that? Its just a phone call to the broker, and a trivial, approximately $500 fee. In fact, IBKR can convert many shares from ADRs to common stock on foreign exchanges <em>automatically</em>, without even a phone call. See <a href=\"https://www1.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=15260#supported-adr\">https://www1.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=15260#supported-adr</a></li>\n<li><strong>BOTH THE HK SHARES AND US SHARES PROVIDE OWNERSHIP.</strong> More precisely, they both confer ownership in the same company - <em>Alibaba Group Holding Limited</em>, incorporated in Cayman Islands. This is a holding company. It has economic interests in China, via contracts with certain VIEs. A VIE must be wholly owned by Chinese citizens.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, both the HK and US shares are the same thing. Both have the same risks. You can convert from one to the other freely. Both carry a VIE risk, in that these Chinese owned VIEs could theoretically be confiscated by the CCP, depriving the holding company of future income. Also</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>THIS IS THE SAME FOR EVERY CHINESE COMPANY.</strong> China forbids foreigners from owning stock in a Chinese company, so <em>every single fucking Chinese stock has the exact same VIE risk.</em> This goes for Tencent, NIO, Netease, Billi etc - under Chinese law, there is no way for a foreigner to do business in China other than through a VIE.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>TLDR - there is no difference whatsoever between HK listings and US listings of Chinese stocks. All Chinese stocks carry an identical VIE risk. You can not get around it by owning the HK stock, it literally makes zero difference, its a contract for the exact same thing and is fully fungible with the US one.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Guys - to clarify, I am not trying to say there is no risk investing in China, or that VIEs don&#39;t carry any risk. I am trying to debunk the common conspiracy theory along the lines of &quot;the CCP can, at any time, eliminate the VIE structure and liquidate US investors in BABA, whilst protecting investors in Hong Kong&quot;. We are all in the same boat, no matter which exchange we bought the shares in, and the shares are completely interchangeable. If the CCP wipes out investors in BABA, they wipe out holders of 9988. (I also doubt they would destroy the VIE structure entirely, and kill Tencent, NIO, NTES and all the rest. They would be killing the entire HKEX).</p>\n\n<p>Since Alibaba Holdings is a core holding for Asian mutual funds (I believe I read recently that its the number 1 holding, but I don&#39;t feel like searching for the reference today), I personally think the probability of the CCP wiping out all all investors in Alibaba is very small, but that&#39;s for you, the individual investor, to decide. (This would also involve wiping out actors like Japan&#39;s SoftBank, most of whose NAV is kept in Alibaba Holdings.)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kk4lei/vies_and_baba_et_al/","title":"VIEs and BABA et al","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 25, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-25T22:49:55.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-25 22:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kk4lei","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kk4lei/vies_and_baba_et_al/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kk4lei/vies_and_baba_et_al/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"wilfredian","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/wilfredian","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"wilfredian","score":274,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Vies和Baba等人","the_new_excerpt":"有一些关于VIE的常见误解，以及VIE和VIE之间的区别\n在美国交易所上市的美国存托凭证和在香港交易所上市的股票。我看到了\n这些误解在这里蔓延，在寻找阿尔法和像莫特利这样的地方传播\n傻瓜。所以我已经详细阅读了美国证券交易委员会的备案文件…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Vies和Baba等人","the_new_excerpt":"有一些關於VIE的常見誤解，以及VIE和VIE之間的區別\n在美國交易所上市的美國存託憑證和在香港交易所上市的股票。我看到了\n這些誤解在這裏蔓延，在尋找阿爾法和像莫特利這樣的地方傳播\n傻瓜。所以我已經詳細閱讀了美國證券交易委員會的備案文件…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-25534587","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25534587","title":"Elephant decline revealed by shipwreck cargo","date":"December 25, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"沉船货物揭示大象数量下降","locale":"zh"},{"title":"沉船貨物揭示大象數量下降","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1341874555527294977","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1341874555527294977","title":"US Inflation Expectations rise to their highest level since April 2019: 1.97% (10-yr breakeven). https://t.co/09zv6KCgH7","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"December 25, 2020","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国通胀预期升至2019年4月以来最高：1.97%(10年期盈亏平衡)。https://t.co/09zv6KCgH7","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國通脹預期升至2019年4月以來最高：1.97%(10年期盈虧平衡)。https://t.co/09zv6KCgH7","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kk4lei","previousId":"HnPost-25534587","nextId":"TweetPost-1341874555527294977","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kk4lei/vies_and_baba_et_al/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","1684688348","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","386998304"]}
