The way it is calculated is by taking the weighted average of all the OTM calls and OTM puts that are being purchased. The demand for OTM puts is what causes the VIX to rise.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve also heard and seen that once the stock market reaches complacency, and <em>everyone</em> believes that the market is going to only head higher, that is when a bubble can pop.</p>\n\n<p>If fewer people buy OTM puts, that means that the VIX is lower, which also holds the assumption that everyone is buying into the market, and there is less money on the sideline.</p>\n\n<p>Well, even though we have recovered from the COVID lows, VIX has never closed below 20. Typically, during a calm period in a bull market, VIX tends to stay comfortably below 20,</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s look at what VIX was before the dotcom crash, banking crash, and the covid crash:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dotcom crash = 16.28</li>\n<li>Banking crash = 18.53</li>\n<li>Covid crash = 18.84</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/HBT879v\">https://imgur.com/HBT879v</a></p>\n\n<p>Those are all the readings the month before the crash.</p>\n\n<p>With the close of February 2021, the VIX is at 27.95. In January, the VIX closed at 33.09. In other words, the VIX is extremely elevated at the moment, and going back in history, we really haven&#39;t seen a full-blown crash while the VIX is already this elevated going into it.</p>\n\n<p>Circling back, this just tells us that throughout the last 6 months, investors have continued to purchase &quot;insurance&quot; in the market, and we haven&#39;t hit the full-on euphoria that some might believe we have hit.</p>\n\n<p>To wrap this up, I don&#39;t believe that the current drop is the start of a major correction. We would need to see more complacency on a further bull run before we truly see the bubble popping that many of us expect.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lusrwm/can_a_bubble_pop_when_vix_is_20/","title":"Can a bubble pop when VIX is > 20","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-01T10:33:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-01 10:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lusrwm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lusrwm/can_a_bubble_pop_when_vix_is_20/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lusrwm/can_a_bubble_pop_when_vix_is_20/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"nycliving1","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/nycliving1","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"nycliving1","score":68,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"当VIX指数大于20时，泡沫会不会破灭？","the_new_excerpt":"我想说的是，在VIX指数的时候，\"泡沫 \"是否能戳破？\n仍在高于平均水平的地方交易。\n\n我们先来看看什么是VIX指数，有人将其称为 \"恐惧指数\"，而\n那是因为它追踪的是未来16-44天的假设波动率。它的方式\n计算方法是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"當VIX指數大於20時，泡沫會不會破滅？","the_new_excerpt":"我想說的是，在VIX指數的時候，\"泡沫 \"是否能戳破？\n仍在高於平均水平的地方交易。\n\n我們先來看看什麼是VIX指數，有人將其稱爲 \"恐懼指數\"，而\n那是因爲它追蹤的是未來16-44天的假設波動率。它的方式\n計算方法是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26418492","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26418492","title":"Oracle Cloud is unreachable","date":"March 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"Oracle云无法访问","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Oracle雲無法訪問","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m20yad","excerpt":"GE has been somewhat struggling in recent years, though recently reached a high\nof around $14 before a 7% drop following the announcement of the intention to\nreverse split.
