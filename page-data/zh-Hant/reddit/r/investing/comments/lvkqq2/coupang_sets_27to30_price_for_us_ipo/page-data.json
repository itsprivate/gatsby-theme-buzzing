The company hadn’t revealed the initial public offering’s expected price range or number of shares in its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406838-coupang-files-for-1-billion-ipo?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\">original filing</a> last month.</li>\n<li>At $27 to $30 a share, Coupang would see a $46B to $51B market cap. That’s way up from a $9B valuation seen when the company last staged a private fundraising round in 2018.</li>\n<li>Coupang was founded in 2010 by Harvard Business School dropout Bom Kim, and is generally ranked as South Korea’s No. 1 e-commerce platform.</li>\n<li>The company aims to beat Amazon and other competitors with several unique features, such one-day and same-day delivery, and even what Coupang calls “Dawn Delivery.” That’s a program where orders placed by midnight arrive the next morning by 7 a.m.</li>\n<li>Coupang also boasts ecofriendly packaging, with 75% of deliveries coming without boxes. Instead, the company uses “eco-bags” that it picks up later and reuses.</li>\n<li>Lastly, Coupang promises “friction-free returns,” allowing customers to simply sign up for returns online and leave goods at their doors without boxing up and labeling items or paying for postage.</li>\n<li>“Our mission is to create a world where customers wonder: ‘How did I ever live without Coupang?’” the company wrote in its IPO prospectus.</li>\n<li>Coupang added in its S-1 that revenues have grown 400% in less than three years, from $900M in 2018’s first quarter to $3.8B in 2020’s fourth period.</li>\n<li>However, Coupang lost $474.9M in 2020, although that’s way down from the $1.1B of red ink it had in 2018.</li>\n<li>SoftBank’s Vision Fund was an early backer of the firm and will own about 37% of Coupang’s Class A stock following the IPO. Other pre-IPO investors include BlackRock and Greenoaks Capital Management.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lvkqq2/coupang_sets_27to30_price_for_us_ipo/","title":"Coupang sets $27-to-$30 price for U.S. IPO","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-02T17:39:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-02 17:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lvkqq2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvkqq2/coupang_sets_27to30_price_for_us_ipo/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvkqq2/coupang_sets_27to30_price_for_us_ipo/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Gangy1","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gangy1","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Gangy1","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Coupang将美国IPO的价格定为27美元至30美元。","the_new_excerpt":" *韩国电子商务巨头Coupang(CPNG)\n   [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CPNG?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link])\n   预计其即将在美国上市的热销产品定价为每股27美元至30美元，有可能\n   筹集36亿美金和...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Coupang將美國IPO的價格定爲27美元至30美元。","the_new_excerpt":" *韓國電子商務巨頭Coupang(CPNG)\n   [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CPNG?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link])\n   預計其即將在美國上市的熱銷產品定價爲每股27美元至30美元，有可能\n   籌集36億美金和...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m3r3v2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3r3v2/found_out_how_to_buy_call_options_yesterday/","title":"Found out how to buy call options yesterday","date":"March 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"昨天发现如何购买看涨期权","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"昨天發現如何購買看漲期權","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m35gnd","excerpt":"This post is in reference to $GME but it applies to the stock market in general.\nDon’t let anyone tell you when you should or should not buy.
