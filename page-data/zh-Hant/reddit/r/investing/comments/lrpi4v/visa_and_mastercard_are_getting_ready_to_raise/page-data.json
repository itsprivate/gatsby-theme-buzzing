The higher fees will apply only to &quot;some&quot; undefined purchases, including &quot;small supermarkets&quot; and &quot;restaurants,&quot; but the categories of spending affected are also expected to include &quot;many online transactions.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s important, because as the WSJ points out, &quot;swipe fees ... are often higher on online purchases&quot; already. (The credit card companies point out that they plan to lower fees on other purchases -- but mainly just &quot;certain low-price transactions.&quot;)  </p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s important to remember, though, once those changes are announced, is that because interchange fees are currently only about 2% per transaction -- yet yield tens of billions of dollars a year in revenue to the card companies -- even a tiny, tenth-of-a-percent increase in the rate charged could potentially add billions of dollars to each company&#39;s top and bottom lines.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lrpi4v/visa_and_mastercard_are_getting_ready_to_raise/","title":"Visa and MasterCard Are Getting Ready To Raise Their Rates.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-24T23:49:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-24 23:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lrpi4v","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrpi4v/visa_and_mastercard_are_getting_ready_to_raise/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrpi4v/visa_and_mastercard_are_getting_ready_to_raise/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"HolderofFour","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HolderofFour","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"HolderofFour","score":315,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"维萨和万事达卡准备提高利率。","the_new_excerpt":"信用卡公司万事达卡（NYSE:MA）和维萨（NYSE:V）的股票----。\n往往是最激烈的竞争者 -- 携手并肩，跑上楼梯\n万事达卡今天一起上涨4.1%，Visa上涨3.2%，截至美国东部时间下午2点55分。\n美东时间下午2点55分，万事达卡上涨4.1%，Visa上涨3.2%。\n\n原因是：两家收费公司都在准备...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"維薩和萬事達卡準備提高利率。","the_new_excerpt":"信用卡公司萬事達卡（NYSE:MA）和維薩（NYSE:V）的股票----。\n往往是最激烈的競爭者 -- 攜手並肩，跑上樓梯\n萬事達卡今天一起上漲4.1%，Visa上漲3.2%，截至美國東部時間下午2點55分。\n美東時間下午2點55分，萬事達卡上漲4.1%，Visa上漲3.2%。\n\n原因是：兩家收費公司都在準備...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lyzdyq","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyzdyq/my_portofolio_this_week/","title":"My portofolio this week","date":"March 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我本周的作品集","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我本週的作品集","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lz3crn","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz3crn/ape_hold/","title":"Ape hold","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 06, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"猿人抱","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"猿人抱","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lrpi4v","previousId":"RedditPost-lyzdyq","nextId":"RedditPost-lz3crn","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lrpi4v/visa_and_mastercard_are_getting_ready_to_raise/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
