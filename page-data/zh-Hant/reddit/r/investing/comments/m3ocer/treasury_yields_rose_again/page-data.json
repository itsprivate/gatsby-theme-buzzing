Basically I heard about the importance of the bond yield rate recently and it sounded quite important. Then I heard about the auction happening on Wednesday and that sounded like it could have consequences, good or bad. From what I understand, the auction was able to sell bonds and thus the yield rate didn’t raise much at all. Then I was like “ok cool that’s over with.” </p>\n\n<p>But today I am on my yahoo finance app and just happen to see TNX as one of the suggested/trending/whatever items. TNX is the 10 year treasury indicator (idk if it’s a stock or a index or what). And I see that it’s at 1.626 which is higher than it closed at from the auction on Wednesday (1.52 or something). So why did it jump up again? I thought it was supposed to be steady after the auction on Wednesday kind of set things in place. Does it matter really?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m3ocer/treasury_yields_rose_again/","title":"Treasury yields rose again","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-13T11:30:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-13 11:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m3ocer","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m3ocer/treasury_yields_rose_again/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m3ocer/treasury_yields_rose_again/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"1-Of-Everything","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/1-Of-Everything","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"1-Of-Everything","score":64,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"国债收益率再次上升","the_new_excerpt":"所以我上次在这里发的帖子也是关于这个的，但我保证我不只是\n不断迷恋这方面的市场。基本上我听说过\n最近债券收益率的重要性，听起来相当重要。然后\n我听说周三有拍卖会，听起来... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"國債收益率再次上升","the_new_excerpt":"所以我上次在這裏發的帖子也是關於這個的，但我保證我不只是\n不斷迷戀這方面的市場。基本上我聽說過\n最近債券收益率的重要性，聽起來相當重要。然後\n我聽說週三有拍賣會，聽起來... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"HnPost-26443406","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/26443406","title":"RethinkDB: why we failed (2017)","date":"March 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"RethinkDB：我们为什么会失败（2017年）？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"RethinkDB：我們爲什麼會失敗（2017年）？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m40mz1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m40mz1/they_tried_and_failed/","title":"THEY TRIED AND FAILED! 🚀🦍🙌💎🙌🦍🚀","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 13, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"他们尝试了，但失败了！🚀🦍🙌💎🙌🦍🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"他們嘗試了，但失敗了！🚀🦍🙌💎🙌🦍🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m3ocer","previousId":"HnPost-26443406","nextId":"RedditPost-m40mz1","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m3ocer/treasury_yields_rose_again/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
