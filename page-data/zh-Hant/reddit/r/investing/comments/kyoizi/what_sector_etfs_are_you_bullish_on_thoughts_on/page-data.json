I saw earlier today a post stating that specialized ETFs typically underperform the market as they were typically launched post rallies and publicity events. However, now you can find sector specific indices for almost every market, and thus should be able to get in independent of triggering publicity/rally events. Hence, done right i think it can be a great addition to the portfolio </p>\n\n<p>To add, I hold 4 of these (UK based): (all bought in 2020 and everyone except for espo has since beaten the global index)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cloud Computing (FSKY)</li>\n<li>Green energy (INRG, top 35 companies)</li>\n<li>Em eCommerce (emqp) </li>\n<li>Video gaming (espo)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I see this as a way to get exposure to 4 sectors I am very convinced on over the next 5 years.
