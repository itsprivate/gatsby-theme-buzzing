I began hoarding cash anticipating a drop and a recession that could last years and depress stock prices.</p>\n\n<p>Until I sat in one of my classes and my professor, a CMT, brought up an interesting point: we might only be at the start of the bull market. He brought up the classic SPX chart showing the enormous returns ever since the &#39;08 recession. Then he brought out other indices such as the Russell 2000 (IWM) and various Emerging Market ETFs (VEA, IEFA, AIA, etc.) and pointed out an oddity: Between 2018 and March 2020, these markets have been stagnant/flat, essentially trading within a range. He explained that while growth in the S&amp;P might have been great the last few years, practically the rest of the world lagged behind.</p>\n\n<p>Basically his point was this: now that all of these other indices/stocks are joining the rally after being stagnant for years, the real bull market is just beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, he and I could easily be wrong. But I was interested in finding out your thoughts on this, what do you guys think?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lmqam9/interesting_take_the_bull_market_is_only_beginning/","title":"Interesting Take: The Bull Market is Only Beginning","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-18T20:13:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-18 20:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lmqam9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lmqam9/interesting_take_the_bull_market_is_only_beginning/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lmqam9/interesting_take_the_bull_market_is_only_beginning/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Misofire","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Misofire","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Misofire","score":473,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"有趣的观点：牛市才刚刚开始","the_new_excerpt":"和你们很多人一样，我也认为，不久的某一天，我们长达10年的牛市一定会出现。\n结束。我开始囤积现金，期待下跌和可能持续的经济衰退。\n年，并打压股价。\n\n直到我坐在我的一节课上，我的教授，一个CMT，提出了一个。\n有趣的是：我们可能只是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有趣的觀點：牛市纔剛剛開始","the_new_excerpt":"和你們很多人一樣，我也認爲，不久的某一天，我們長達10年的牛市一定會出現。\n結束。我開始囤積現金，期待下跌和可能持續的經濟衰退。\n年，並打壓股價。\n\n直到我坐在我的一節課上，我的教授，一個CMT，提出了一個。\n有趣的是：我們可能只是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lv2c57","excerpt":"I’ve been seeing a lot of people build different tools in stocks and wsb that\ntrack social mentions and sentiment analysis for different stocks.\n\nSome of the good ones I’ve used include marketstream, quiverquant, unbiastock,\ngambiste etc\n\nNone of them are perfect though.
