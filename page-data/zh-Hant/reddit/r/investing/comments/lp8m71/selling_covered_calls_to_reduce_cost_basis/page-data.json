Would it behoove the individual to sell covered calls, or is there another strategy besides averaging down to reduce cost basis?</p>\n\n<p>Theoretically how low can you reduce your cost basis by selling covered calls?   If you sold weeklys and reduced your cost basis by .20 a week, is it possible to reduce your cost basis far beyond the current selling price; provided it trades side ways for an extended period of time?</p>\n\n<p>Would a better strategy be to average down as much as one could first and then sell covered calls?  </p>\n\n<p>I’m intrigued by these strategies that basically look like outright arbitrage. Ive been watching a lot of videos on the subject and have been curious as to how other individuals use this and other options strategies to accrue passive income, reduce cost basis, or any other advantages of options.</p>\n\n<p>I really hope this is a long enough post to not get deleted.  I haven’t found the answer I’m looking for on any videos or websites.  That or I’m overlooking the answer and just need clarification. Thanks to all who reply.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lp8m71/selling_covered_calls_to_reduce_cost_basis/","title":"Selling covered calls to reduce cost basis","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-22T04:42:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-22 04:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lp8m71","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lp8m71/selling_covered_calls_to_reduce_cost_basis/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lp8m71/selling_covered_calls_to_reduce_cost_basis/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"casinos_not_7-11s","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/casinos_not_7-11s","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"casinos_not_7-11s","score":117,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"出售备兑通知书以降低成本基础","the_new_excerpt":"假设一个人做多400股，但目前的卖出价格低于他们的 \"买入价\"。\n目前的成本基础。个人是否应该卖出备兑看涨期权，或者是\n除了平均下来降低成本基础，还有其他策略吗？\n\n理论上通过卖出保本的方式，可以将成本基础降低到多低...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"出售備兌通知書以降低成本基礎","the_new_excerpt":"假設一個人做多400股，但目前的賣出價格低於他們的 \"買入價\"。\n目前的成本基礎。個人是否應該賣出備兌看漲期權，或者是\n除了平均下來降低成本基礎，還有其他策略嗎？\n\n理論上通過賣出保本的方式，可以將成本基礎降低到多低...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lp485g","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lp485g/ive_been_bag_holding_this_meme_along_with_my_gme/","title":"I’ve been bag holding this meme along with my GME","date":"February 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我一直拿着这个备忘录和我的GME在一起","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我一直拿着這個備忘錄和我的GME在一起","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1363493433147592706","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1363493433147592706","title":"Covid-19 has nearly wiped out the seasonal flu...\n\nhttps://t.co/vvHarzay5g https://t.co/CVLlVLSn6H","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 22, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"科维德-19几乎消灭了季节性流感... ...\n\nhttps://t.co/vvHarzay5g https://t.co/CVLlVLSn6H","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"科維德-19幾乎消滅了季節性流感... ...\n\nhttps://t.co/vvHarzay5g https://t.co/CVLlVLSn6H","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lp8m71","previousId":"RedditPost-lp485g","nextId":"TweetPost-1363493433147592706","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lp8m71/selling_covered_calls_to_reduce_cost_basis/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
