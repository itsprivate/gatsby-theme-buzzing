Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 838,000 applications in the latest week.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Gross domestic product increased at a 4.1% annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth. That was a slight upward revision from the 4.0% pace reported last month. The economy grew at a record 33.4% rate in third quarter.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;The economy’s struggles in the final three months of 2020 are mostly in the rear view mirror. The sharp rebound retail sales and President Joe Biden’s massive $1.9 trillion recovery package, which is gaining traction in the U.S. Congress, have prompted economists to boost their first-quarter growth estimates to as high as a 6% rate from as low as a 2.3% pace.&#39;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ls9a7e/us_weekly_jobless_claims_fall_more_than_expected/","title":"US Weekly Jobless Claims Fall More Than Expected to 730,000","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-25T23:54:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-25 23:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ls9a7e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ls9a7e/us_weekly_jobless_claims_fall_more_than_expected/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ls9a7e/us_weekly_jobless_claims_fall_more_than_expected/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"WeenisWrinkle","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/WeenisWrinkle","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"WeenisWrinkle","score":80,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"美国周度初请失业金人数降幅大于预期至73万人","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-more-than-expected-idUSKBN2AP1T2\n\n文章中的一些说明。\n\n\"初次申请国家失业救济金的人数经季节性调整后达到了\n截至2月20日当周为73万，前一周为84.1万，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國周度初請失業金人數降幅大於預期至73萬人","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-more-than-expected-idUSKBN2AP1T2\n\n文章中的一些說明。\n\n\"初次申請國家失業救濟金的人數經季節性調整後達到了\n截至2月20日當週爲73萬，前一週爲84.1萬，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1365068929970954244","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1365068929970954244","title":"Another blowout quarter for Nikola: $0 in revenue and $147 million net loss.
