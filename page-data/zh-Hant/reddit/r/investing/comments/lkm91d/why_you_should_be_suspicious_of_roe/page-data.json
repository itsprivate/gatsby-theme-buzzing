Thought this would be useful for all your DD efforts.</p>\n\n<p>ROE (Return on Equity) aka Net Income / Average Shareholders&#39; Equity</p>\n\n<p>People love throwing out ROE numbers to get you to love whatever they are pitching, but you should be automatically suspicious of ROE as a headliner number.</p>\n\n<p>ROE can be written another way: ROE = ROA x Financial Leverage.</p>\n\n<p>ROA is an <strong>operating</strong> metric.</p>\n\n<p>Financial Leverage is a <strong>capital structure</strong> metric.</p>\n\n<p>So ROE is a blended metric of both: operations and capital structure.</p>\n\n<p>This is significant because when you are comparing two competitors and think that one with a higher ROE is a better value play that may be a mistake. </p>\n\n<p>Those two hypothetical companies may have the same exact ROA but company A may just have borrowed heavily, which will jack up ROE. No change in business model, operations, efficiency, etc, just a simple increase in debt will make your ROE go up, even if you just sit on the cash and don&#39;t use it.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, debt is risky for equity holders, no guarantee that a company will use it for productive projects. This risk is further compounded in a near zero rate environment.</p>\n\n<p>ROA is a more relevant metric if you are commenting on the core business model.</p>\n\n<p>At best, ROE without context is a distraction. At worst, it can be downright misleading.</p>\n\n<p>Happy Investing!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>btw this wouldn&#39;t apply to bank stocks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lkm91d/why_you_should_be_suspicious_of_roe/","title":"Why You Should be Suspicious of ROE","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-15T22:24:53.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-15 22:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lkm91d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lkm91d/why_you_should_be_suspicious_of_roe/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lkm91d/why_you_should_be_suspicious_of_roe/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"russel_leffingwell","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/russel_leffingwell","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"russel_leffingwell","score":1147,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么你应该对ROE产生怀疑？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，我只是想给大家额外介绍一下一个常用的小指标\n我一直看到的太松散的各种投资周围抛出。\n子reddits。觉得这对你所有的DD工作都是有用的。\n\nROE(Return on Equity)又名净收入/平均股东权益。\n\n人们喜欢...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼你應該對ROE產生懷疑？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，我只是想給大家額外介紹一下一個常用的小指標\n我一直看到的太鬆散的各種投資周圍拋出。\n子reddits。覺得這對你所有的DD工作都是有用的。\n\nROE(Return on Equity)又名淨收入/平均股東權益。\n\n人們喜歡...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1365071339736956936","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1365071339736956936","title":"DoorDash looking at ARKK\n\n https://t.co/qY4fIEGU9K","date":"February 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"DoorDash看ARKK\n\n https://t.co/qY4fIEGU9K","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"DoorDash看ARKK\n\n https://t.co/qY4fIEGU9K","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lsjrwl","excerpt":"Rocket Companies (ticker RKT) is Rocket Mortgage, the online mortgage broker\nlaunched by Quicken Loans in 2015.\n\nRKT had their Q4 earnings released today, and as of market close were trading at\n$19.90, and $20.90 as of this post during AH.\n\nFirst, let me briefly mention that RKT has been shorted…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lsjrwl/rocket_companies_rkt_who_owns_rocket_mortgage_is/","title":"Rocket Companies ($RKT), who owns Rocket Mortgage, is a slam dunk","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 26, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"拥有Rocket Mortgage的Rocket Companies($RKT)是个大热门。","the_new_excerpt":"火箭公司（股票代码RKT）是火箭抵押贷款，在线抵押贷款经纪公司。\n由Quicken Loans在2015年推出。\n\nRKT今天发布了第四季度财报，截至收盘时交易价格为\n19.90美元，AH期间截止到本帖，20.90美元。\n\n首先，我简单说一下，RKT已经被做空... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"擁有Rocket Mortgage的Rocket Companies($RKT)是個大熱門。","the_new_excerpt":"火箭公司（股票代碼RKT）是火箭抵押貸款，在線抵押貸款經紀公司。\n由Quicken Loans在2015年推出。\n\nRKT今天發佈了第四季度財報，截至收盤時交易價格爲\n19.90美元，AH期間截止到本帖，20.90美元。\n\n首先，我簡單說一下，RKT已經被做空... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lkm91d","previousId":"TweetPost-1365071339736956936","nextId":"RedditPost-lsjrwl","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lkm91d/why_you_should_be_suspicious_of_roe/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
