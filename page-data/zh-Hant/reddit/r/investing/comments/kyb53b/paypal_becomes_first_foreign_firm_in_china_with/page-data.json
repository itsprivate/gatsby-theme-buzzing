The stake purchase came a year after PayPal bought a 70% stake in GoPay for an undisclosed amount，then becoming the first foreign company licensed to provide online payment services in China.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>PayPal declined to comment.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>In taking full control of one of the smaller players in the world’s largest payment market, PayPal will compete with domestic payments giants Alipay, owned by Alibaba-affiliated Ant Group, and WeChat Pay, owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd, as China fully opens up its financial sector.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>The stake purchase also comes amid Beijing’s antimonopoly campaign against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and other Internet companies.  </p>\n\n<p>Last August, PayPal appointed Hannah Qiu as head of China business, responsible for formulating long-term strategy in the world’s second-biggest economy. Qiu was a former executive at insurer Ping An Group’s fintech unit OneConnect, according to PayPal’s website.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/china-paypal-stake/paypal-becomes-first-foreign-firm-in-china-with-full-ownership-of-payments-business-idUSL4N2JP14M\">Reuters</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kyb53b/paypal_becomes_first_foreign_firm_in_china_with/","title":"PayPal becomes first foreign firm in China with full ownership of payments business","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-16T10:08:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-16 10:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kyb53b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kyb53b/paypal_becomes_first_foreign_firm_in_china_with/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kyb53b/paypal_becomes_first_foreign_firm_in_china_with/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ChocolateTsar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChocolateTsar","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ChocolateTsar","score":803,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"PayPal成为中国首家拥有支付业务全部所有权的外资企业","the_new_excerpt":"我很惊讶这个没有发布，因为它似乎很有新闻价值，所以几个\n我想，晚几天总比不晚好。\n\n> 上海（路透社）--PayPal Holding Inc已成为第一家外国运营商。\n>拥有中国支付平台100%的控制权，据中国的。\n>政府数据，作为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"PayPal成爲中國首家擁有支付業務全部所有權的外資企業","the_new_excerpt":"我很驚訝這個沒有發佈，因爲它似乎很有新聞價值，所以幾個\n我想，晚幾天總比不晚好。\n\n> 上海（路透社）--PayPal Holding Inc已成爲第一家外國運營商。\n>擁有中國支付平臺100%的控制權，據中國的。\n>政府數據，作爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l5nrq1","excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/microsoft-msft-earnings-q2-2021.html\n\nEarnings: $2.03 per share, adjusted, vs. $1.64 per share as expected by\nanalysts, according to Refinitiv.\n\nRevenue: $43.08 billion, vs. $40.18 billion as expected by analysts, according\nto Refinitiv.\n\nRevenue from Microsoft’s…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l5nrq1/microsoft_reports_17_revenue_growth_as_cloud/","title":"Microsoft reports 17% revenue growth as cloud business accelerates","date":"January 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"微软报告收入增长17%，云业务加速发展","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/microsoft-msft-earnings-q2-2021.html\n\n盈利：调整后每股2.03美元，预期为每股1.64美元。\n根据Refinitiv的数据，分析师。\n\n营收：430.8亿美元，而分析师预期为401.8亿美元，据。\n到Refinitiv。\n\n收入来自微软的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"微軟報告收入增長17%，雲業務加速發展","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/microsoft-msft-earnings-q2-2021.html\n\n盈利：調整後每股2.03美元，預期爲每股1.64美元。\n根據Refinitiv的數據，分析師。\n\n營收：430.8億美元，而分析師預期爲401.8億美元，據。\n到Refinitiv。\n\n收入來自微軟的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l5o97l","excerpt":"+5% after hours.\n\n * Revenue: $43.1 billion versus $40.2 billion expected\n * Earnings per share: $2.03 versus $1.64 expected\n * Intelligent Cloud: $14.68 versus $13.76 billion expected\n * More Personal Computing: $15.12 versus $13.55 billion expected","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l5o97l/msft_blows_away_q2_expectations/","title":"MSFT blows away Q2 expectations","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 26, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"微软第二季度业绩预期大放异彩","the_new_excerpt":"+5％，下班后。\n\n * 收入：431亿美元，预期为402亿美元。\n * 每股收益。2.03美元，而预期为1.64美元\n * 智能云：146.8元，而预期137.6亿元。\n * 更多的个人计算：151.2美元，而预期为135.5亿美元。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"微軟第二季度業績預期大放異彩","the_new_excerpt":"+5％，下班後。\n\n * 收入：431億美元，預期爲402億美元。\n * 每股收益。2.03美元，而預期爲1.64美元\n * 智能雲：146.8元，而預期137.6億元。\n * 更多的個人計算：151.2美元，而預期爲135.5億美元。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kyb53b","previousId":"RedditPost-l5nrq1","nextId":"RedditPost-l5o97l","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kyb53b/paypal_becomes_first_foreign_firm_in_china_with/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
