The contract was for a base year and three option years, and Palantir was awarded $110 million at the time for the base year.</p>\n\n<p>In the last year, Army Vantage has helped leaders make data-driven decisions in the fight against Covid-19.</p>\n\n<p>The second contract is a two-year deal worth up to $31.5 million with the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS) to provide a software platform for secure, reliable and timely processing of data to enable NHS decision-makers to best plan the use of resources and improve patient care.</p>\n\n<p>NHS personnel will use Palantir&#39;s software to understand how Covid-19 is spreading, identify risks to particularly vulnerable populations, proactively increase health and care resources in emerging hot spots, ensure critical equipment is supplied to the facilities with the greatest need and divert patients and service users to the facilities that are best able to care for them.</p>\n\n<p>The NHS will also use Palantir as part of its planning and operational roll-out of the U.K.’s vaccine program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kk4sd0/denvers_palantir_closes_out_2020_with_nearly_150m/","title":"Denver's Palantir closes out 2020 with nearly $150M in new government contracts","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 25, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-25T20:30:44.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-25 20:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kk4sd0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kk4sd0/denvers_palantir_closes_out_2020_with_nearly_150m/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kk4sd0/denvers_palantir_closes_out_2020_with_nearly_150m/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"NineteenSixtySix","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/NineteenSixtySix","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"NineteenSixtySix","score":345,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"丹佛Palantir以近1.5亿美元的新政府合同结束2020年","the_new_excerpt":"丹佛商业杂志\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2020/12/24/palantir-closes-december-2020-contracts.html]\n\n>随着这一年的结束，丹佛最新的科技巨头正在积累新的\n>政府合同。\n>\n>Palantir Technologies，一家价值200亿美元的数据分析软件公司，…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"丹佛Palantir以近1.5億美元的新政府合同結束2020年","the_new_excerpt":"丹佛商業雜誌\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2020/12/24/palantir-closes-december-2020-contracts.html]\n\n>隨着這一年的結束，丹佛最新的科技巨頭正在積累新的\n>政府合同。\n>\n>Palantir Technologies，一家價值200億美元的數據分析軟件公司，…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kumsjp","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kumsjp/teslas_25000_electric_car_coming_sooner_than/","title":"Tesla's $25,000 Electric Car Coming Sooner Than Expected, 2022 Launch Hinted 🚀 🚀","date":"January 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"特斯拉25,000美元电动汽车比预期来得更早，2022年发布暗示🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉25,000美元電動汽車比預期來得更早，2022年發佈暗示🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"HnPost-25722656","excerpt":"","slug":"/hn/25722656","title":"YouTube bans Steve Bannon's podcast channel","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 11, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"HnJson","localize":[{"title":"YouTube禁止史蒂夫·班农的播客频道","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YouTube禁止史蒂夫·班農的播客頻道","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kk4sd0","previousId":"RedditPost-kumsjp","nextId":"HnPost-25722656","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kk4sd0/denvers_palantir_closes_out_2020_with_nearly_150m/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
