I finished it recently and it is one of the most challenging novels I’ve ever read.</p>\n\n<p>When I only read for a bit or tried to rush myself, nothing would register because of the manic writing style and jumps in the story. But when I took my time, I really got into it and it became a very funny book. I think this short passage illustrates it well: </p>\n\n<p>‘Nature instantly ebb’d again, — the film returned to its place, — the pulse fluttered — stopp’d — went on — throb’d — stopp’d again — moved — stopp’d — shall I go on? — No.’</p>\n\n<p>It also feels astonishingly modern. It was first fully published in 1767, but it’s full of these jokes and characters that felt like something out of Beckett or a Coen Brothers movie. The main character sets out to tell his life story but doesn’t get to his date of birth until past the half-way point and his uncle is so obsessed with fortifications that he’s almost unable to talk about anything else.</p>\n\n<p>The introduction by Christopher Ricks gives an interesting background: “Certainly the rise of the novel was a great achievement, but Sterne seems to have been one of the first to realize that a novelist, just because he was indeed creating, might be tempted to think himself endued with godlike powers of scrutiny. So instead of the omniscient, omnipotent narrator humorously deployed by Fielding, Sterne substitutes the vague half-knowledge and frustrated impotence of  Tristram.”</p>\n\n<p>To finish with a quote from the novel: ‘L—d! said my mother, what is all this story about? - A COCK and a BULL, said Yorick — And one of the best of its kind, I ever heard’</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/nwxodk/tristram_shandy/","title":"Tristram Shandy","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"June 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-11T03:01:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-11 03:01","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e3e95a47-07cc-55a5-ab35-be29d665e17a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nwxodk/tristram_shandy/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nwxodk/tristram_shandy/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"AlessandroLeone","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/AlessandroLeone","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"AlessandroLeone","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"トリストラム・シャンディ","the_new_excerpt":"ローレンス・スターンの『The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman』を読んだことがある人はいるだろうか。\nローレンス・スターンの『紳士シャンディの生涯と意見』を読んだことがある人はいるだろうか。最近読み終えたのですが、今まで読んだ小説の中で\nこれまでに読んだ小説の中で最もチャレンジングな作品です。\n\nちょっとだけ読んだり、急いで読んだりしても、何も頭に入ってきませんでした。\n躁状態のせいで...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Tristram Shandy","the_new_excerpt":"我很想知道这里有谁读过劳伦斯-斯特恩（Laurence Sterne）的《特里斯特姆-香迪的生活和观点》（The Life and Opinions of Tristram\n绅士香迪》，作者是劳伦斯-斯特恩。我最近读完了这本书，这是我读过的最有挑战性的小说之一。\n这是我读过的最具挑战性的小说之一。\n\n当我只读了一会儿或试图催促自己时，什么也记不起来了\n因为它的狂躁...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Tristram Shandy","the_new_excerpt":"我很想知道這裏有誰讀過勞倫斯-斯特恩（Laurence Sterne）的《特里斯特姆-香迪的生活和觀點》（The Life and Opinions of Tristram\n紳士香迪》，作者是勞倫斯-斯特恩。我最近讀完了這本書，這是我讀過的最有挑戰性的小說之一。\n這是我讀過的最具挑戰性的小說之一。\n\n當我只讀了一會兒或試圖催促自己時，什麼也記不起來了\n因爲它的狂躁...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-670a8398-2d7a-5461-bb2d-c6018bcb18fe","excerpt":"I was thinking about rereading Animal Farm last night, and while it is a good\nbook in its own right, I remember a lot of the pleasure of reading it was the\nslow realization of just where the story was headed (I won't explain further\nhere as I want people who read it for the first time to enjoy the…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/nwqm0l/whats_a_book_you_wish_you_could_read_again_for/","title":"What's a book you wish you could read again for the first time?","date":"June 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"もう一度、最初から読み直したい本は？","the_new_excerpt":"昨夜、『動物農場』を再読しようと考えていたのですが、この本はそれなりに良い本ではあるものの\nそれなりに良い本ではありますが、この本を読む楽しみの多くは\n物語がどこに向かっているのかをゆっくりと理解することが、この本を読む楽しみの多くだったことを覚えています。\n初めて読んだ人にも楽しんでもらいたいので、ここでは説明しませんが。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你希望第一次能再读哪本书？","the_new_excerpt":"我昨晚想重读《动物农场》，虽然这本书本身是一本好书，但我记得有很多东西都是我自己写的。\n虽然它本身是一本好书，但我记得阅读它的很多乐趣在于\n我记得阅读它的很多乐趣是慢慢意识到故事的走向（我不会进一步解释\n我不会在此进一步解释，因为我希望第一次读这本书的人能够享受这本书。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你希望第一次能再讀哪本書？","the_new_excerpt":"我昨晚想重讀《動物農場》，雖然這本書本身是一本好書，但我記得有很多東西都是我自己寫的。\n雖然它本身是一本好書，但我記得閱讀它的很多樂趣在於\n我記得閱讀它的很多樂趣是慢慢意識到故事的走向（我不會進一步解釋\n我不會在此進一步解釋，因爲我希望第一次讀這本書的人能夠享受這本書。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-f039d501-3235-5624-9f13-54100043f804","excerpt":"Is 'Gone Girl' worth reading if I have already watched the movie?","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/nwtjc3/gone_girl/","title":"Gone Girl","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"June 11, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ゴーン・ガール","the_new_excerpt":"ゴーン・ガール」は、映画をすでに見ていても読む価値がありますか？","locale":"ja"},{"title":"乱世佳人","the_new_excerpt":"如果我已经看了电影，《乱世佳人》值得一读吗？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"亂世佳人","the_new_excerpt":"如果我已經看了電影，《亂世佳人》值得一讀嗎？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-e3e95a47-07cc-55a5-ab35-be29d665e17a","previousId":"RedditPost-670a8398-2d7a-5461-bb2d-c6018bcb18fe","nextId":"RedditPost-f039d501-3235-5624-9f13-54100043f804","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/books/comments/nwxodk/tristram_shandy/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
