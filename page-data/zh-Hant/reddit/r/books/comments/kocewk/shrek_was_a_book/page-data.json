A super prolific children&#39;s author (<a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/CoverofDoctordesoto.gif\">Dr. De Soto</a>, Sylvester and the Magic Pebble), or 2. The most-ever published author and illustrator in the <a href=\"https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/new-yorker-february-15th-1964-william-steig.jpg\">New Yorker</a> (in 73 years he worked for them, he produced 2600 drawings and 117 covers).</p>\n\n<p>In short, the guy who wrote Shrek! in 1990 had some serious literary chops.</p>\n\n<p>Curious, I picked up a copy. It’s great, and not what I was expecting. Here are the best parts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Shrek has super powers.</strong> He gets bit by a snake. The snake dies. He breathes fire, and can spit a flame 99 yards and vent smoke from his ears. He cooks a pheasant with his eyes. He eats lightening.</li>\n<li><strong>The art is UGLY in an endearing and iconic way.</strong> I’ve never been a fan of “ugly art” a la Ren and Stimpy, but there is <a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/41/36/39/41363963004818debd4c2269b3464ebd.jpg\">something endearing about the way Shrek and his malevolence</a> are depicted. The art fits the theme.</li>\n<li><strong>The Verbs are great.</strong> Toddled, spit, cowed, convulsed, hissed things over, kicked, hatched, cackled, crowed, cried, scythed, mumbled...that’s in the first few pages.</li>\n<li><strong>It isn’t Disney-fied.</strong> Shrek does not look for redemption. He is a monster. He is hideous. He hates kind things. He still finds a princess (just as hideous), and gets hitched.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And I think that’s the best part. Steig doesn’t use the ogre to make some point about inner beauty, or redemption, or grace.</p>\n\n<p>In the book’s climax, Shrek has to confront his own horrifying visage in a hall of mirrors. This is the perfect spot for Steig to shoehorn in a lesson--for Shrek to look at what he is, reflect on his journey, and learn the error of his ways. Instead, Steig writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>“He faced himself, full of rabid self-esteem...happier than ever to be exactly what he was.”</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then he marries the princess.</p>\n\n<p>So Shrek has literary origins! Who knew?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/kocewk/shrek_was_a_book/","title":"Shrek was a book?!","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T03:12:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 03:12","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"54b0ce71-de1a-5230-baba-3b213dc4a9bc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kocewk/shrek_was_a_book/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kocewk/shrek_was_a_book/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/QIshtfAJ8UasOoXWFSNTpQcr0bTykSyO7J_W7jUAqA0.jpg?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e33f1405fb9a0aa747d4cde5193df1d15f13b6ca","video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"ContentFarmer","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ContentFarmer","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ContentFarmer","score":11063,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"史莱克是一本书？","the_new_excerpt":"我读了一些关于史莱克历史的书\n[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/Shrekcover.jpg]（说来话长）。\n并得知这是一本比电影早十年写的儿童读物\n出来了。\n\n不仅如此，这本书的作者是威廉-斯蒂格，你可能会认出他是谁。\n1.…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"史萊克是一本書？","the_new_excerpt":"我讀了一些關於史萊克歷史的書\n[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/Shrekcover.jpg]（說來話長）。\n並得知這是一本比電影早十年寫的兒童讀物\n出來了。\n\n不僅如此，這本書的作者是威廉-斯蒂格，你可能會認出他是誰。\n1.…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-9394c22d-2ba9-5813-b87f-2d4ec1c9d8cc","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ksp9g5/simon_schuster_cancels_plans_for_senator_hawleys/","title":"Simon & Schuster Cancels Plans for Senator Hawley’s Book","date":"January 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Simon & Schuster取消参议员Hawley的图书计划。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Simon & Schuster取消參議員Hawley的圖書計劃。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-78346fe8-485c-58b9-abd3-cbfa8ca1fead","excerpt":"Just finished ‘and then there were none’.
