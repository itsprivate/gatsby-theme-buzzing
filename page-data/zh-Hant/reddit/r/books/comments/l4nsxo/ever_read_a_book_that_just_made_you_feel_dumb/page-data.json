I think that compared to the general population, I have an above-average vocabulary. But Gnomon by Nick Harkaway is making me feel illiterate. The guy&#39;s word choices are so foreign to me, and used with such frequency that if I were to look up the words in the dictionary, I might as well just read the dictionary. In addition to the frequent unknown-to-me words, he&#39;ll sometimes string together a quarter page sentence that just leaves me bewildered. &quot;What the hell did I just read?&quot; I will add, though, that I am thoroughly enjoying this book. The concept, the story telling, and the characters are all fantastic and my mind gets blown with every turn of the page. I&#39;m just going to have to re-read the entire thing again to catch everything.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l4nsxo/ever_read_a_book_that_just_made_you_feel_dumb/","title":"Ever read a book that just made you feel dumb?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T05:05:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 05:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ed6cedd6-f62d-524b-9452-b7b9d2599452","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l4nsxo/ever_read_a_book_that_just_made_you_feel_dumb/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l4nsxo/ever_read_a_book_that_just_made_you_feel_dumb/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Thedrumdoctor","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Thedrumdoctor","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Thedrumdoctor","score":206,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"有没有看过一本让你觉得很蠢的书？","the_new_excerpt":"我先说一句，我觉得我的书读得很好。我认为\n与一般人相比，我的词汇量高于平均水平。但是\n尼克-哈卡威的《侏儒》让我觉得自己是个文盲。这家伙的文字选择是\n对我来说太陌生了，而且使用频率很高，如果我... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有沒有看過一本讓你覺得很蠢的書？","the_new_excerpt":"我先說一句，我覺得我的書讀得很好。我認爲\n與一般人相比，我的詞彙量高於平均水平。但是\n尼克-哈卡威的《侏儒》讓我覺得自己是個文盲。這傢伙的文字選擇是\n對我來說太陌生了，而且使用頻率很高，如果我... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-4535b1b7-ed65-5b73-aa99-5892640ea5fb","excerpt":"I ask because I read And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie when I was in\nhigh school, but I skipped the epilogue because I guess I thought it was boring?\nAnyway, for years I always assumed that the last character alive had been the\nmurderer - until two weeks ago when someone mentioned here…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l4p0kx/has_anyone_ever_completely_misunderstood_or/","title":"Has anyone ever completely misunderstood or misread a book and not realized it until years later?","date":"January 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"有没有人曾经完全误解或误读一本书，直到多年后才意识到？","the_new_excerpt":"我之所以这么问，是因为我读过阿加莎-克里斯蒂的《那时没有人》，当我还在上学的时候。\n高中，但我跳过了尾声，因为我想我认为它是无聊的？\n总之，多年来，我一直以为最后一个活着的角色是...\n杀人犯 - 直到两周前有人在这里提到... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有沒有人曾經完全誤解或誤讀一本書，直到多年後才意識到？","the_new_excerpt":"我之所以這麼問，是因爲我讀過阿加莎-克里斯蒂的《那時沒有人》，當我還在上學的時候。\n高中，但我跳過了尾聲，因爲我想我認爲它是無聊的？\n總之，多年來，我一直以爲最後一個活着的角色是...\n殺人犯 - 直到兩週前有人在這裏提到... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-e82d2f75-7456-5338-8ba8-9ae704026180","excerpt":"Given the current state of events with QAnon, Flat Earthers, Sovereign Citizens,\n9-11 Truthers, Holocaust Deniers, Moon Landing Deniers, and people who believe\nBill Gates is trying to Microchip them...I'm looking for books about the\npsychology of conspiracy theorists.\n\nI've only found one book just…","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/l4ro5s/books_about_why_people_fall_for_conspiracy/","title":"Books about why people fall for conspiracy theories","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 26, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"关于人们为什么会爱上阴谋论的书籍。","the_new_excerpt":"鉴于目前QAnon、平耳人、主权公民的事件状况。\n9-11真相的人，大屠杀否认者，登月否认者，以及那些相信\n比尔-盖茨正试图给他们植入芯片......我正在寻找有关的书籍。\n阴谋论者的心理学。\n\n我只发现一本书，只是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於人們爲什麼會愛上陰謀論的書籍。","the_new_excerpt":"鑑於目前QAnon、平耳人、主權公民的事件狀況。\n9-11真相的人，大屠殺否認者，登月否認者，以及那些相信\n比爾-蓋茨正試圖給他們植入芯片......我正在尋找有關的書籍。\n陰謀論者的心理學。\n\n我只發現一本書，只是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-ed6cedd6-f62d-524b-9452-b7b9d2599452","previousId":"RedditPost-4535b1b7-ed65-5b73-aa99-5892640ea5fb","nextId":"RedditPost-e82d2f75-7456-5338-8ba8-9ae704026180","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l4nsxo/ever_read_a_book_that_just_made_you_feel_dumb/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
