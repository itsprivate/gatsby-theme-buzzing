For decades now I have been a regular reader of blurbs...newspaper articles...Reddit...things like that. But couldn&#39;t make it through an entire book for some reason. It&#39;s like I couldn&#39;t focus enough to really lose myself in the story like I used to. I was constantly distracted (computer generation? Although I&#39;m 51).</p>\n\n<p>A friend recommended Educated, and I finished it in a couple of days. It&#39;s light reading I know, but that is exactly what I needed. Next I picked up The Tattooist of Auschwitz (history is my other great love). I&#39;m about halfway through and struggling a little bit, mostly because it&#39;s sad and I have to keep forcing myself to go back to it. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for hearing me out, I feel a bit ridiculous exclaiming it, but I am just so happy that I read a book!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l9l118/i_read_a_book_a_whole_book/","title":"I read a book.
