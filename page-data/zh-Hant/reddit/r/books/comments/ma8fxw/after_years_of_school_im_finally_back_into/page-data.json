My partner and I throughout our training picked up so many books on the whim, only to leave them on our bookshelf. They became deadweight as we moved from city to city. A few months into my first real job, I finally found free time. I decided to get back to into reading. I wanted to get back into sci-fi. This was spurred on by the amazing movies of recent (Interstellar, Gravity, The Martian, and yes even the recent Star Wars movies) as well as the excitement over last year&#39;s NASA astronaut apps and all the Artemis/Mars missions.</p>\n\n<p>I picked up <strong>Artemis</strong> by Andy Weir about a civilization on the Moon, and it was so much fun. It has been years since I read a book fully (the last was actually The Martian) and it took so much time and energy to experience this book. But it was so worth it.</p>\n\n<p>I continued to reading <strong>Ready Player One</strong>, then the first Expanse book (<strong>Leviathan Wakes</strong>), and now I&#39;m on the <strong>Three-Body Problem</strong>. My reading speed has picked up a bit, my endurnace too, and everything in my life seems to have changed. My phone time is down, my sleep is better, and I have more energy. Our toddler is also picking up books more I think cuz she sees us reading. But the best is that special feeling you get when you&#39;re completed immersed in a book. <strong>That indescribable high.</strong> Honestly, I haven&#39;t felt that way since high school, since I never read more than a book a year since then. That connection and compassion for the characters that even the best movies or TV shows can&#39;t do (well, The Expanse show comes close). It is such a special experience that I really hope my generation and Zoomers come back to books. You really can&#39;t replicate it through other mediums.</p>\n\n<p>My advice to those whose reading careers have been stymied by their work careers is to find that time and keep reading! Even if for just 5 minutes. Forget having to make it difficult literature, just find something that is fun for you. It will be so difficult at first anyway. But keep at it. After a few months, it has transformed into a <strong>brain massage</strong>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ma8fxw/after_years_of_school_im_finally_back_into/","title":"After years of school, I'm finally back into reading.
