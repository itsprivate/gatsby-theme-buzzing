I consult the internet and find a list of the top ten or whatever of the last year. Most of them don&#39;t apply to my interests, but maybe a few of them do. I go to a bookstore. I find one off the list and, out of curiosity, I check out the reviews. Only a 3.8? Why? One person says the book is God&#39;s gift to mankind, another says that it is literal trash. Hm, maybe it&#39;s not for me. Oh, this one looks good. A 3.0! Why? Oh, the protagonist is trash and the plot is even worse. Let me keep looking.</p>\n\n<p>This happens every single time I go looking for something new. Even when I promise myself that I will put my phone <em>down</em> and <em>not look at the reviews</em>, I always wind up there. Maybe it&#39;s the curiosity, maybe it&#39;s the fear that I&#39;ll buy yet another book to do nothing more than collect dust on a shelf. It&#39;s like trying to choose something off the menu at a restaurant, but there are thousands of options and every item has ten reviews listed. If a text has less than a 4.0 or even so much as a single scathing &quot;waste of my time&quot; review, my brain decides, &quot;Hmm, objective garbage. Keep looking.&quot; I used to be spontaneous! Book shopping used to be fun! Now I leave crestfallen and empty-handed nearly every time. </p>\n\n<p>And yes, the culprit is Goodreads.</p>\n\n<p>Is anyone else struggling with this fixation on reviews? Have you gotten over it? If so, how?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m7yf1v/the_internet_has_ruined_book_shopping_for_me/","title":"The internet has ruined book shopping for me","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-19T03:56:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-19 03:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ce0859ad-81aa-5204-855d-5ce9d8896bba","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m7yf1v/the_internet_has_ruined_book_shopping_for_me/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m7yf1v/the_internet_has_ruined_book_shopping_for_me/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"ladystarkitten","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ladystarkitten","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ladystarkitten","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"网络毁了我的购书生涯","the_new_excerpt":"请允许我介绍一下情况。我准备好了一本新书。我在网上查阅了一些资料\n找个去年的前十名什么的榜单。他们中的大多数人都没有\n适用于我的兴趣， 但也许其中的几个做。我去了一家书店。我发现\n之一，出于好奇，我查看了评论....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"網絡毀了我的購書生涯","the_new_excerpt":"請允許我介紹一下情況。我準備好了一本新書。我在網上查閱了一些資料\n找個去年的前十名什麼的榜單。他們中的大多數人都沒有\n適用於我的興趣， 但也許其中的幾個做。我去了一家書店。我發現\n之一，出於好奇，我查看了評論....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6bce1d98-4154-5b7d-b698-fa06b8d91cf0","excerpt":"Something in the vein of The Midnight Library or Dark Matter.","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/m7usqv/book_about_alternate_lives_or_parallel_universes/","title":"Book about alternate lives or parallel universes","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"另一种生活或平行宇宙的书本","the_new_excerpt":"像《午夜图书馆》或《黑暗物质》那样的东西。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"另一種生活或平行宇宙的書本","the_new_excerpt":"像《午夜圖書館》或《黑暗物質》那樣的東西。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-08f9a953-e20b-5910-925d-e61652ff747a","excerpt":"My wife and I just watched our friends lose a 5-week long battle with their\ndaughter in the NICU, and it’s shaken us both up a fair bit.\n\nMy wife wants to read a book that is light hearted.
