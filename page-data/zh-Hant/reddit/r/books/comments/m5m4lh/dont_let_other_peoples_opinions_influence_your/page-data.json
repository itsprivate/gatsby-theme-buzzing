But recently, I&#39;ve noticed more and more how people let other&#39;s opinions influence and even dictate what they choose to do and not to do. I&#39;ve noticed in some friends of mine that they will turn away from their interests because the herd of people that have spoken out about the topic were negative.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, while the logic is sound in the sense that they will save themselves time, but I&#39;d question to ask where this saved time is being spent if not on your interests.</p>\n\n<p>Last night I decided to read &quot;The Alchemist&quot; by Paulo Coelho. I&#39;ve seen several posts here and there about it being amazing, terrible, underwhelming, or whatnot. After reading it, I don&#39;t feel an overwhelming sense of self realization by any means, but I wouldn&#39;t go as far as talking ill of the book. It can serve to help people experience the &quot;hero&#39;s journey&quot; which is the core of many stories out there. It&#39;s not terribly dense or difficult to unpack, but I wouldn&#39;t devalue the book by any means. I&#39;ve spent years wanting to read this book because of the hype, but last night I finally did because I saw posts talking less of it.</p>\n\n<p>I enjoyed it. It&#39;s akin to The Little Prince. A very straightforward story that can be appreciated by all to some degree. At the least, it will open a door to allow a person to look more introspectively on their lives and to connect with themselves and their virtues. To put such a lesson in an easily digestible book is nothing short of valuable.</p>\n\n<p>So all in all, think for yourselves whether to pick up a book or not. Take the opinions of others always with a grain of salt(even mine for that matter), because your experience will not be theirs. Follow your bliss, and trust in the path you want to take.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m5m4lh/dont_let_other_peoples_opinions_influence_your/","title":"Don't let other people's opinions influence your curiosities","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-15T17:12:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-15 17:12","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"42316688-8b41-57fc-a7cd-c11bdc52955b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m5m4lh/dont_let_other_peoples_opinions_influence_your/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m5m4lh/dont_let_other_peoples_opinions_influence_your/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"DKSigh51","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DKSigh51","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DKSigh51","score":70,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"不要让别人的观点影响你的好奇心。","the_new_excerpt":"我的措辞很含糊，因为我认为它在很多方面都很适用。\n我们生活中的方方面面。但最近，我注意到越来越多的人是如何让...\n别人的意见影响甚至决定了他们的选择和不选择。\n做。我注意到我的一些朋友会拒绝... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不要讓別人的觀點影響你的好奇心。","the_new_excerpt":"我的措辭很含糊，因爲我認爲它在很多方面都很適用。\n我們生活中的方方面面。但最近，我注意到越來越多的人是如何讓...\n別人的意見影響甚至決定了他們的選擇和不選擇。\n做。我注意到我的一些朋友會拒絕... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-75c4d75f-c266-53ba-a174-ad338d9a3f9b","excerpt":"Last night I woke up by my dog and was super confused by the dream I had.
