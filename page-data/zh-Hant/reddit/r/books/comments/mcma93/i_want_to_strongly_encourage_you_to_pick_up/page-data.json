Very rarely do I have experiences that make me contemplate my own mortality, but my only thought when I finally stopped reading these books was &quot;Wow...I will never get those hundreds of hours back&quot;.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been a lifetime fan of Sci-fi and Fantasy, but these books almost turned me off the genre altogether.  For months afterward, I would think about some gruesome, inhumane, poorly written scene and just feel altogether slimy.  </p>\n\n<p>Since then, I&#39;ve discovered Naomi Novik, Brandon Sanderson, and others who have shown me what <em>good</em> fantasy looks like and rekindled my love for magical worlds.  But the appreciation I have for them by comparison to Goodkind is not worth the effort of having read Goodkind in the first place.  </p>\n\n<p>Please, pick up something else.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mcma93/i_want_to_strongly_encourage_you_to_pick_up/","title":"I want to strongly encourage you to pick up anything other than \"Wizard's First Rule\" by Terry Goodkind","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-25T04:17:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-25 04:17","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"7123869b-a565-5062-97c5-0dda99ac30dd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mcma93/i_want_to_strongly_encourage_you_to_pick_up/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mcma93/i_want_to_strongly_encourage_you_to_pick_up/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"DoctorWhy75","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DoctorWhy75","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"DoctorWhy75","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我想强烈鼓励你拿起任何其他的东西 除了泰瑞-古德金德的《魔法师的第一规则》之外","the_new_excerpt":"我深深地后悔读过《真理之剑》系列的前11本。\n(之后我就把这个系列永远放下了)，但每当有人问我关于\n该系列，我冻结和我的大脑开始跌宕起伏在多个反应，以\n表达我为什么这么不喜欢它。\n\n到目前为止，我可以把它缩小到... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我想強烈鼓勵你拿起任何其他的東西 除了泰瑞-古德金德的《魔法師的第一規則》之外","the_new_excerpt":"我深深地後悔讀過《真理之劍》系列的前11本。\n(之後我就把這個系列永遠放下了)，但每當有人問我關於\n該系列，我凍結和我的大腦開始跌宕起伏在多個反應，以\n表達我爲什麼這麼不喜歡它。\n\n到目前爲止，我可以把它縮小到... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-97d5394f-0ef5-53fa-b67f-d6ec701db347","excerpt":"I get how this may sound absurd.. but I'm looking for a book written from the\nperspective of other characters, the antagonist for instance or perhaps various\ndifferent side characters, and how they view or perceive the \"protagonist\" and\ntheir crusade or quest.\n\nFor example, if the chapter is…","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/mckwwp/a_book_where_the_main_character_isnt_in_it/","title":"A book where the \"main\" character isn't in it","date":"March 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"一本 \"主角 \"不在其中的书","the_new_excerpt":"我知道这听起来很荒唐... 但我在找一本从 \"我 \"开始写的书。\n其他角色的角度，比如说反面人物，或者是各个\n不同的侧面人物，以及他们如何看待或认识 \"主角 \"和。\n他们的讨伐或追求。\n\n例如，如果该章是．","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一本 \"主角 \"不在其中的書","the_new_excerpt":"我知道這聽起來很荒唐... 但我在找一本從 \"我 \"開始寫的書。\n其他角色的角度，比如說反面人物，或者是各個\n不同的側面人物，以及他們如何看待或認識 \"主角 \"和。\n他們的討伐或追求。\n\n例如，如果該章是．","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-b3fadc5c-5b2c-551c-a551-fc4352577241","excerpt":"I think we all resonate with most books to a certain extent and compare them to\nour lives but which book felt undoubtedly meant to be in your life and perhaps\nchanged the course of your life?\n\nMine was Forty Rules of Love by Elif Shafak.
