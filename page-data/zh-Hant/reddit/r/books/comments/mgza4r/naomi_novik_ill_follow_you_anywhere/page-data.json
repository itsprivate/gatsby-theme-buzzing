In a way, it reminded me of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, and Howl&#39;s Moving Castle, but there was plenty of originality and great writing to make it seem more than just the sum of these parts. </p>\n\n<p>Two days ago, I started <em>Spinning Silver</em>, and though I was planning to make it last for the whole week...I just <em>couldn&#39;t!</em> I stayed up until 1 AM (a big deal for me, since I get up at 6) to finish it, and then had to look up fanfiction afterwards. Ugh, it was just. so. good. The characters were amazing, the story was tense and creative, the writing phenomenal, and the resolution was...*chef&#39;s kiss*. It&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve been so invested in a story that I just have to know, right away, how it ends.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone else a fan? Has anyone read the Temeraire series?
