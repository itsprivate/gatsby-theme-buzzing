They mention that they &quot;read&quot; the book, and there are a <em>lot</em> of upvoted comments telling OP that OP didn&#39;t &quot;read&quot; the book, they listened to it. Some of these commenters are more respectful than others, but all of them have this idiotic, elitist attitude about what it means to &quot;read&quot; a book. Why do you care? Someone is sharing the joy they experience while reading a book. Isn&#39;t that what this sub is all about? Get over yourselves.</p>\n\n<p>There are also quite a few upvoted comments telling op that if WWZ is one of the best books they&#39;ve read, then they need to read more books. There&#39;s no nuance here, these commenters are just being straight up rude.</p>\n\n<p>Stop gatekeeping &quot;reading&quot; or whatever. Someone referring to listening to an audiobook as &quot;reading&quot; does not harm you in anyway.  </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I am getting a lot of comments about about the definition of reading. The semantic point doesn&#39;t matter. As one commenter pointed out, an audio reader and a visual reader can hold a conversation about the same book and not realize they read in different formats. That&#39;s really all that matters. Also, when I see these comments, they usually include of imply some kind of value-judgment, so they aren&#39;t just comments on semantics.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lxqx7o/whats_with_the_gatekeeping_surrounding_audiobooks/","title":"What's with the gatekeeping surrounding audiobooks?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-04T19:22:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-04 19:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"96ea76fa-9d36-5beb-88ac-3914d2f16b14","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lxqx7o/whats_with_the_gatekeeping_surrounding_audiobooks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lxqx7o/whats_with_the_gatekeeping_surrounding_audiobooks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"fspluver","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/fspluver","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"fspluver","score":143,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"有声书的把关是怎么回事？","the_new_excerpt":"在我写这篇文章的时候，子上的头条是有人分享他们的。\n听《Z战》有声书的经历。他们提到，他们 \"读\"\n的书，而且有很多上票的评论告诉OP，OP没有\n\"读 \"这本书，他们听了。其中一些评论者是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有聲書的把關是怎麼回事？","the_new_excerpt":"在我寫這篇文章的時候，子上的頭條是有人分享他們的。\n聽《Z戰》有聲書的經歷。他們提到，他們 \"讀\"\n的書，而且有很多上票的評論告訴OP，OP沒有\n\"讀 \"這本書，他們聽了。其中一些評論者是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-57dcb5ba-61d1-53f9-8bed-f3dfb3b328ae","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lxjfzl/happy_world_book_day_did_you_know_that_exeter_in/","title":"Happy World Book Day.
