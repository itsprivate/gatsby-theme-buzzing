I genuinely struggled to put it down, I refused to do anything until I finished my chapter and then when I did, I’d move onto the next and blitz through that one too, and then...well, you get the picture.</p>\n\n<p>This is one of the most moving, emotional and genuinely funny books that I have ever read. I don’t think I’m ever gonna forget certain sections of this book for as long as I live. The intense ‘Rumble’, the bleaching (and, in a sense, butchering) of the hair, Johnny’s final letter to Ponyboy. To be honest, the death of Johnny is gonna stay with me forever...I mean it, I’m never going to forget that moment. The way that Dally loses it, hammering on the wall and letting everything out, throwing his hard exterior in that moment, it’s truly a powerful moment. “Stay gold, Ponyboy. Stay Gold.” Johnny, man...goddamn it.</p>\n\n<p>I have heard for many, many years that this book is incredible but I just haven’t managed to get around to it until now. Let me just say, the wait was 100% worth it. What a read. It is truly something quite magnificent. A beautiful story.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lal0sl/i_just_finished_s_e_hiltons_the_outsiders/","title":"I just finished S. E.
