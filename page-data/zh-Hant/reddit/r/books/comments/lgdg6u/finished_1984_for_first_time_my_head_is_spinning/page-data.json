The rise of the PC movement is nowhere close to the “Thought Police” as much as people want to claim it is.  But damn, there were so many scenes and lines that just so epitomized the nature of the current political scene.  </p>\n\n<p>“Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth.  It is impossible to see reality except by looking through the lens of the Party.”  When I read this, I had to stop.  It was just striking to read such a synopsis of the blind allegiance people have to “their party” and the inability to conceive there is a reality outside what they are being fed through media.  </p>\n\n<p>To me the whole notion of trying to control the messaging of the past in order to control the present and the future, the whole concept of “doublethink” was perhaps the greatest insight, and warning, I took from the book.  </p>\n\n<p>We aren’t living in 1984, but we are allowing ourselves to venture down a path where more and more people are becoming Parsons, blindly following the narrative set forth for him, and not Winston, questioning the truth behind lies. </p>\n\n<p>Great book. Glad I finally read it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lgdg6u/finished_1984_for_first_time_my_head_is_spinning/","title":"Finished 1984 for first time.
