Recently, my professor said something about expanding your own library - read a genre you usually wouldn&#39;t, read books that doesn&#39;t initially interest you. It got me thinking about my own reading habits. I mainly read books from the same handful of authors, and when I discover someone new, it&#39;s usually someone very similiar to my old favorites (Kafka, Hemingway, Dostoevsky, Bukowski, Murakami, Despentes). I know there are a lot of differences between these authors, but they do have a lot in common, I think. </p>\n\n<p>If I&#39;m going to be a librarian, or something similar, I need to be able to recommend books to all different types of people, so I started picking up books that I ususally wouldn&#39;t, and it&#39;s been great! I&#39;ve discovered so many great books and authors lately, and thought I&#39;d motivate some of you guys to do the same. Try something new, even if you end up hating it, you never know what you might find.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m8gz7g/expand_your_horizon/","title":"Expand your horizon","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-19T18:03:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-19 18:03","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"c975ea0e-12bd-598c-800b-cd4bd3e68c1a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m8gz7g/expand_your_horizon/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m8gz7g/expand_your_horizon/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"HitchofferChristens","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HitchofferChristens","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"HitchofferChristens","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"扩大你的视野","the_new_excerpt":"我学的是图书馆员。最近，我的教授说了一些关于\n扩充自己的图书馆--读你平时不会读的类型，读的书。\n最初并不感兴趣。这让我想到了自己的阅读习惯。\n我主要看同一批作者的书，当我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"擴大你的視野","the_new_excerpt":"我學的是圖書館員。最近，我的教授說了一些關於\n擴充自己的圖書館--讀你平時不會讀的類型，讀的書。\n最初並不感興趣。這讓我想到了自己的閱讀習慣。\n我主要看同一批作者的書，當我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3ce351ea-b1e3-5749-b333-fdae2f5a7169","excerpt":"I started Jurassic Park yesterday afternoon.
