There&#39;s not even a library here except in schools, and when there&#39;s a library it&#39;s treated like a place to babble with your friends. If you see someone say, &quot;I like reading books&quot; it&#39;s mostly girls who are obsessed with Wattpad. It&#39;s alright, a book is a book regarding the story, but I just want people to read. Most of us are addicted to a game called Mobile Legends, so they have no time to read.
