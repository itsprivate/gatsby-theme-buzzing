And sure, there are certain plots I enjoy more than others. Usually that&#39;s the case because writers of certain genres tend to write in certain ways. I love reading about different stories and people. </p>\n\n<p>I love reading about a nobody who becomes a hero and saves the world along the way. \nI love reading about a selfish king who realizes in the end that he was the reason his kingdom burned to ashes. \nI love reading about a historical person and the little details about their life that tell me that the author really researched them. \nI love reading about monsters, horrific torture scenes, a teenage girl crushing on some perfect boy and daydreaming about their possible marriage, an escort, a tech-nerd who still gets the girl... </p>\n\n<p>But I only enjoy it if I love the style. No matter how good the plot, the writing style has to match. I love the general idea of Harry Potter or The Mortal Instruments. I still couldn&#39;t finish them because I find the style unbelievable and/ or boring. (Yes, feel free to send me hate now).</p>\n\n<p>Every plot can be interesting if written by someone who can create complex characters who you feel with and describe their experiences in a way that make your skin crawl.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ly80ev/unpopular_opinion_the_genre_doesnt_matter_the/","title":"Unpopular opinion: The genre doesn't matter, the style does","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-05T14:24:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-05 14:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"3e2d96a7-f0fb-5b01-b856-be9681e3a4df","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ly80ev/unpopular_opinion_the_genre_doesnt_matter_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ly80ev/unpopular_opinion_the_genre_doesnt_matter_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Kusuo-Saiki","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kusuo-Saiki","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Kusuo-Saiki","score":70,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"不受欢迎的意见。类型不重要，风格才重要","the_new_excerpt":"我已经记不清有多少次被问到我喜欢的类型是什么了。\n当然，有些情节我比其他的更喜欢。通常那是\n的情况下，因为某些类型的作家往往以某种方式写作。我喜欢\n阅读不同的故事和人。\n\n我喜欢阅读...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不受歡迎的意見。類型不重要，風格才重要","the_new_excerpt":"我已經記不清有多少次被問到我喜歡的類型是什麼了。\n當然，有些情節我比其他的更喜歡。通常那是\n的情況下，因爲某些類型的作家往往以某種方式寫作。我喜歡\n閱讀不同的故事和人。\n\n我喜歡閱讀...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-23419cad-cac1-5c3b-b86f-fe47dd10e9f7","excerpt":"A few days ago, my father gave me his copy of Ender's Game that he read in 85 at\nmy age (15) and told me to read it.\n\nAt the beginning, I was reluctant.
