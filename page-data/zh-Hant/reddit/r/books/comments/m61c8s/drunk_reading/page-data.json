I drank so much that I would pass out reading and think I had finished the book I was reading. I would wake up the next day and reread the ending to make sure I had finished the whole thing.  A lot of the time I would discover that I had dreamed a completly different ending. The endings in my dreams were so real and tired together so well with the original story that I would be surprised. Use to love being able to finish a book and then comparing my story with the authors. My own private book club of sorts. At last I don&#39;t drink like that any more (my family and my liver rejoice) but thought I would share to see if anyone else has ever experienced a similar situation?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/m61c8s/drunk_reading/","title":"Drunk reading","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-16T17:49:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-16 17:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"eac30c75-20e4-516e-9a05-91ca48cf3822","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m61c8s/drunk_reading/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m61c8s/drunk_reading/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"atwkthc","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/atwkthc","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"atwkthc","score":117,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"醉酒阅读","the_new_excerpt":"我不这样做了，但当我年轻的时候，哑巴和在军队，我会\n读书的时候，享受几杯酒，或者两杯酒，或者......嗯，很多酒。我喝了那么多\n我读着读着就会昏昏欲睡，以为自己看完了书。I\n第二天醒来，重读结局，以确保我... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"醉酒閱讀","the_new_excerpt":"我不這樣做了，但當我年輕的時候，啞巴和在軍隊，我會\n讀書的時候，享受幾杯酒，或者兩杯酒，或者......嗯，很多酒。我喝了那麼多\n我讀着讀着就會昏昏欲睡，以爲自己看完了書。I\n第二天醒來，重讀結局，以確保我... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-b2b1bb1d-b515-570f-81e6-c0e4daf96dbb","excerpt":"So my partner has a copy of House of Salt and Sorrows that has 30 pages of The\nLeaving swapped into it.
