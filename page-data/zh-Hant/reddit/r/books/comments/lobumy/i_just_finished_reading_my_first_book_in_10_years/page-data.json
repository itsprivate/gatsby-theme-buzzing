When it comes to entertainment, I much prefer video games, tv shows, or movies.  I struggle to ever just sit down and read a book for longer than 10 minutes before stopping.  I think the last book I read from start to finish was in High School and for a class... so this year I decided enough is enough.  I absolutely love the Witcher Video Game series and TV Show so I decided to give The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski a try.  I initially bought this book off Amazon July 13, 2015... Almost 6 years ago.  It was absolutely amazing from start to finish!  Not only was it an amazing book, but it&#39;s made me appreciate the Witcher series as a whole even more.  I&#39;m going to be reading Blood of Elves next which I already picked up from Barnes and Noble recently.</p>\n\n<p>Despite this being my first book in 10 years, and I know it took me almost two months to read it, I hope to read at least 5 books this year as a minimum.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I highly recommend The Last Wish if you&#39;re a fan of the Witcher games and show, it&#39;s absolutely incredible.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Quick edit, but I also REALLY love the Expanse show on Amazon so I grabbed Leviathan Wakes by James S.A. Corey as well :))  So I guess i&#39;ve got a proper goal set out and some books lined up to read!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lobumy/i_just_finished_reading_my_first_book_in_10_years/","title":"I just finished reading my first book in 10 years!","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-20T18:57:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-20 18:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"8ea71ec6-2ba3-59d5-8550-0e788b3c72d1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lobumy/i_just_finished_reading_my_first_book_in_10_years/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lobumy/i_just_finished_reading_my_first_book_in_10_years/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"korosenaiii","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/korosenaiii","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"korosenaiii","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我刚刚读完了10年来的第一本书!","the_new_excerpt":"我一生都在为读书而苦恼。当涉及到\n娱乐，我更喜欢视频游戏，电视节目，或电影。我努力\n曾经只是坐下来读一本书超过10分钟才停下来。I\n我想我最后一本从头到尾读完的书是在高中和... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我剛剛讀完了10年來的第一本書!","the_new_excerpt":"我一生都在爲讀書而苦惱。當涉及到\n娛樂，我更喜歡視頻遊戲，電視節目，或電影。我努力\n曾經只是坐下來讀一本書超過10分鐘才停下來。I\n我想我最後一本從頭到尾讀完的書是在高中和... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-184a983c-2241-5da6-bfad-9faa3bf2241d","excerpt":"I know Agatha Christie books are probably a given, but I’m looking more for a\nquirky mystery thriller with a genius storyline and a light hearted atmosphere\nabove a dark situation..","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/lnzqmn/books_with_a_knives_out_feel/","title":"Books with a “Knives Out” feel","date":"February 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"有 \"刀枪不入 \"感觉的书","the_new_excerpt":"我知道阿加莎-克里斯蒂的书可能是必然的，但我更多的是在寻找一个。\n古灵精怪的悬疑惊悚片，天才的故事情节，轻松的氛围。\n在黑暗的环境之上...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有 \"刀槍不入 \"感覺的書","the_new_excerpt":"我知道阿加莎-克里斯蒂的書可能是必然的，但我更多的是在尋找一個。\n古靈精怪的懸疑驚悚片，天才的故事情節，輕鬆的氛圍。\n在黑暗的環境之上...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-e346899d-60ba-5935-acc9-b43efbee5ed5","excerpt":"I just wanted to give a quick story about how I got hooked on audiobooks which\nbrought back my love of 'reading' for anyone who this might help.\n\nI had heard about these audiobook things for a while but wasn't sure if I'd like\nthem or not.
