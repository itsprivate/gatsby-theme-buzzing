I had been buying BTC slowly starting in the fall of 2016, and I eventually accumulated almost 13 of them. If I had just tucked those away and never touched them, I feel fairly confident in saying I would be a millionaire within the next 5 years, possibly a multi-millionaire.</p>\n\n<p>But then, greed struck. I wanted to find the next &quot;diamond in the rough&quot; project that no one else knew about, and get in on the ground floor and watch it shoot up 500% over the next year. I was sucked in by a project called QASH, and kudos to you if you&#39;ve ever even heard of it. I went all in, 100%, on QASH, and in January 2018, QASH hit its ATH and I had about $500,000 to my name. I thought I had done it, that I had picked the right horse, and I&#39;d be a millionaire before the end of 2018. But then, QASH absolutely cratered, but I kept holding out hope it was going to bounce back. Finally, in August, I sold back in to BTC, and I was down to just 5 BTC in my name.</p>\n\n<p>Then, in the fall, we had a family emergency and not enough money to cover it. I was forced to sell my BTC for about $3k each. I eventually ended up selling everything. I had 0 BTC, when just 12 months before, I had half a million dollars.</p>\n\n<p>I finally bought back in once our financial situation stabilized, but could only really afford .65 BTC (1 BTC was worth $10k when I bought back in). But then, just like before, I started looking around at projects that could pay some big dividends. I did a lot of research into Tezos (XTZ), and decided that I liked what they were doing, and that they would be a good investment. I bought all in when it was worth about $3 sometime last spring.</p>\n\n<p>Since that time, Tezos has fallen and is now treading water at about $2. Meanwhile, if I&#39;d left my investment in BTC alone, I&#39;d have about $19k today. My Tezos investment is worth $4,300 by comparison, good for .148 BTC as of this writing.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line is, greed will hurt you. Every time. I still think it&#39;s possible Tezos is going to do some big things, but I could have kept my money in BTC and bought into Tezos now and gotten a lot more than what I currently have.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t learn my lesson last time and made the exact same stupid mistake. But at least I still have something, and maybe a glimmer of hope. I just pray that Tezos does not become another QASH.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to tell me what a moron, idiot, fool, etc I am.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/koghwh/how_i_went_from_hodling_almost_13_btc_to_15_btc/","title":"How I went from HODLing almost 13 BTC to .15 BTC","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"January 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-01T23:45:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-01 23:45","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"koghwh","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/koghwh/how_i_went_from_hodling_almost_13_btc_to_15_btc/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/koghwh/how_i_went_from_hodling_almost_13_btc_to_15_btc/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"louiseaveryb","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/louiseaveryb","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"louiseaveryb","score":210,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我是如何从接近13 BTC到0.15 BTC的","the_new_excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/f1ava51onr861.jpg?width=551&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10764d943c51d7d9a53aa76d363877e79bc4289d\n\n上图显示了我在2017年3月吃了多少BTC。我一直在买BTC\n从2016年秋天慢慢开始，我最终积累了近13个\n他们。如果我有…就好了","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我是如何從接近13 BTC到0.15 BTC的","the_new_excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/f1ava51onr861.jpg?width=551&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10764d943c51d7d9a53aa76d363877e79bc4289d\n\n上圖顯示了我在2017年3月吃了多少BTC。我一直在買BTC\n從2016年秋天慢慢開始，我最終積累了近13個\n他們。如果我有…就好了","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-koe3oj","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/koe3oj/recordlow_electricity_prices_in_sweden_make_it_a/","title":"Record-Low Electricity Prices in Sweden Make It a ‘Lucrative Place' to Mine Bitcoin","date":"January 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"瑞典创纪录的低电价使其成为开采比特币的“有利可图的地方”","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"瑞典創紀錄的低電價使其成爲開採比特幣的“有利可圖的地方”","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kob3q6","excerpt":"Edit : Thank you for all the upvotes and to the anonymous redditor for my first\ngold reward 😍😊 Happy New Year to all the hard core Crypto fans 🙌","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kob3q6/received_my_stimulus_direct_deposit_today_2400/","title":"Received my stimulus direct deposit today - 2400$, will add more BTC","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 02, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"今天收到了我的刺激性直接存款-2400美元，将增加更多的BTC","the_new_excerpt":"编辑：感谢你所有的支持，也感谢我的第一个匿名编辑\n金牌奖励😍😊祝所有密码铁杆粉丝新年快乐🙌","locale":"zh"},{"title":"今天收到了我的刺激性直接存款-2400美元，將增加更多的BTC","the_new_excerpt":"編輯：感謝你所有的支持，也感謝我的第一個匿名編輯\n金牌獎勵😍😊祝所有密碼鐵桿粉絲新年快樂🙌","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-koghwh","previousId":"RedditPost-koe3oj","nextId":"RedditPost-kob3q6","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/koghwh/how_i_went_from_hodling_almost_13_btc_to_15_btc/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","386998304","4203388852"]}
