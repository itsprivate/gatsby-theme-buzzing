Might be relevant for some, entertaining for others. Link to the original post at the bottom.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The story goes... During the 2017 bull market, a college student making $12/hour at Barnes &amp; Noble puts $5,000 into GDAX. By December that year, his portfolio is at $880k. So my dude quits selling books and picks out a lambo in his favorite color? Nope. He was chasing a million and never took profits. By January, the market tanks and he&#39;s down 85%. But that means he still has $125k, which is a damn good return on $5k (2400%). Story over? Not a chance.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>When he made his money and when he lost it is very important because this is the Land of the Free. Uncle Sam comes knocking and says you owe $400k in taxes. Since the realized capital gains were made in 2017 and the realized capital losses happened in 2018, he can&#39;t use any of those losses to offset gains. He&#39;s on the hook for the full amount. The post asks for advice, and the general consensus was to work with the IRS on an Offer in Compromise. Basically, the IRS takes the last $125K and calls it even.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s an unfortunate part of trading, but with the run in Bitcoin and many alts this year, the new (tax) year will be here in 7 days. Who knows what will happen in 2021. Make sure you guys are staying safe and covering yourself for any potential liabilities.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: taxes suck</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Link to original post with 1099-K: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/9tcnu8/did_i_ruin_my_life_by_trading_crypto/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">https://np.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/9tcnu8/did_i_ruin_my_life_by_trading_crypto/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kjahru/did_i_ruin_my_life_by_trading_crypto/","title":"\"Did I ruin my life by trading crypto?\"","tags":["CryptoCurrency","reddit"],"date":"December 24, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-24T15:40:34.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-24 15:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kjahru","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kjahru/did_i_ruin_my_life_by_trading_crypto/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kjahru/did_i_ruin_my_life_by_trading_crypto/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"CryptoCurrency","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency","author":"braun224","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/braun224","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"braun224","score":84,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"“我是不是因为交易密码而毁了自己的生活？”","the_new_excerpt":"我当时正和我弟弟密谈，记得我读过这篇疯狂的帖子。\n几年前，所以我回去找到了它。可能与某些人相关，\n给别人带来娱乐。链接到底部的原始帖子。\n\n\n\n故事是这样说的..。在2017年牛市期间，一名大学生制作了…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"“我是不是因爲交易密碼而毀了自己的生活？”","the_new_excerpt":"我當時正和我弟弟密談，記得我讀過這篇瘋狂的帖子。\n幾年前，所以我回去找到了它。可能與某些人相關，\n給別人帶來娛樂。鏈接到底部的原始帖子。\n\n\n\n故事是這樣說的..。在2017年牛市期間，一名大學生製作了…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kjbm51","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kjbm51/binance_now_supports_segwit_deposits/","title":"Binance Now Supports SegWit Deposits","date":"December 24, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Binance现在支持SegWit存款","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Binance現在支持SegWit存款","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kjglkb","excerpt":"Price of Bitcoin on Christmas Eve:\n\n2020 - $23,400\n\n2019 - $7,318\n\n2018 - $4,124\n\n2017 - $13,673\n\n2016 - $899\n\n2015 - $453\n\n2014 - $330\n\n2013 - $651\n\n2012 - $13\n\n2011 - $4\n\n2010 - $0.25","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kjglkb/merry_christmas_and_enjoy_gains_and_may_next_year/","title":"Merry Christmas and enjoy gains and may next year be even better!","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"December 24, 2020","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"祝圣诞快乐，享受收获，愿明年更美好！","the_new_excerpt":"平安夜比特币价格：\n\n2020年--23,400美元\n\n2019年--7318美元\n\n2018年-4,124美元\n\n2017年-13,673美元\n\n2016-899美元\n\n2015-453美元\n\n2014-330美元\n\n2013-651美元\n\n2012-13美元\n\n2011-4美元\n\n2010-0.25美元","locale":"zh"},{"title":"祝聖誕快樂，享受收穫，願明年更美好！","the_new_excerpt":"平安夜比特幣價格：\n\n2020年--23,400美元\n\n2019年--7318美元\n\n2018年-4,124美元\n\n2017年-13,673美元\n\n2016-899美元\n\n2015-453美元\n\n2014-330美元\n\n2013-651美元\n\n2012-13美元\n\n2011-4美元\n\n2010-0.25美元","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kjahru","previousId":"RedditPost-kjbm51","nextId":"RedditPost-kjglkb","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kjahru/did_i_ruin_my_life_by_trading_crypto/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","386998304","4203388852"]}
