Don’t get me wrong, YA/teen books are great it’s just that I’d like to relate to a character more of my age and that’s going through more of what I’m going through as an adult now. I really like fantasy/sci-fi fiction and I’m big fan of the Percy Jackson series and comic books in general. Every time I ask in a bookstore, I’m always told that there’s nothing wrong with reading YA and that adult books like what I’m looking for don’t really exist. :/</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you all for commenting and validating me in my search for these books! I’m super excited to get my reading train going again 😁</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/lrnpjn/adult_series_similar_to_percy_jacksonsuper_heroes/","title":"Adult series similar to Percy Jackson/Super Heroes?","tags":["booksuggestions","reddit"],"date":"February 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-25T03:09:53.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-25 03:09","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3188ebf3-352a-5733-b6e0-29dc8715b0b9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/lrnpjn/adult_series_similar_to_percy_jacksonsuper_heroes/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/lrnpjn/adult_series_similar_to_percy_jacksonsuper_heroes/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"booksuggestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions","author":"lemonhead32106","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lemonhead32106","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"lemonhead32106","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"类似珀西-杰克逊/超级英雄的成人系列？","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我以前一直都在看YY的书，现在突然间就觉得不可思议了\n我很难把注意力集中在他们身上，也很难和他们的角色联系在一起。别误会我的意思\nYA/青少年的书很好，只是我想更多地和一个角色联系起来。\n我的年龄，这是怎么回事 通过更多的我要去... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"類似珀西-傑克遜/超級英雄的成人系列？","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我以前一直都在看YY的書，現在突然間就覺得不可思議了\n我很難把注意力集中在他們身上，也很難和他們的角色聯繫在一起。別誤會我的意思\nYA/青少年的書很好，只是我想更多地和一個角色聯繫起來。\n我的年齡，這是怎麼回事 通過更多的我要去... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-db2325c1-11b9-528c-99b2-adafb4845330","excerpt":"What an absolute journey that book is, I found myself questioning why the book\nwas rated so highly half way through.
