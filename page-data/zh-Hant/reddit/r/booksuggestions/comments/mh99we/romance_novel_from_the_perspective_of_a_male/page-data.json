I also want the characters to be more realistic and grounded if possible, and not feel like a fantasy, so preferably no super hot billionare businessman male leads Christian Gray style or sexy supermodel female lead, and the story centers around more normal people.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/mh99we/romance_novel_from_the_perspective_of_a_male/","title":"Romance novel from the perspective of a male character?","tags":["booksuggestions","reddit"],"date":"March 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-31T21:45:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-31 21:45","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"5e532d53-b355-5804-9679-09a578ba3f26","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/mh99we/romance_novel_from_the_perspective_of_a_male/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/mh99we/romance_novel_from_the_perspective_of_a_male/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"booksuggestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions","author":"rizzaring","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rizzaring","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"rizzaring","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"以男性角色为视角的言情小说？","the_new_excerpt":"我是一个女孩，但我不知道为什么我更喜欢阅读 从一个男人的角度比。\n我是做女生的，尤其是在言情方面，我比较感兴趣。\n那么有谁知道有什么好的言情小说，我们可以看到故事中的\n通过一个男主角的眼睛？\n\n我只是希望它是一个... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"以男性角色爲視角的言情小說？","the_new_excerpt":"我是一個女孩，但我不知道爲什麼我更喜歡閱讀 從一個男人的角度比。\n我是做女生的，尤其是在言情方面，我比較感興趣。\n那麼有誰知道有什麼好的言情小說，我們可以看到故事中的\n通過一個男主角的眼睛？\n\n我只是希望它是一個... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":null,"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-5e532d53-b355-5804-9679-09a578ba3f26","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/mh99we/romance_novel_from_the_perspective_of_a_male/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
