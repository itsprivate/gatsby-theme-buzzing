After 9/11, criticizing America became taboo. Really up until a few years ago, sex and sexuality wasn&#39;t something that was freely discussed.  Do you think a gay person could host an event in 80s Wyoming talking about how homosexuality is natural? Before the internet, suburban mothers took a lot more active role in trying to &quot;cancel&quot; content they perceived as immoral.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever the zeitgeist is, those who don&#39;t conform have always been ostracized. The dominant culture/values always looks to preserve itself. It&#39;s more noticeable now with social media - but this isn&#39;t a new problem, and nor is in a uniquely liberal problem.
