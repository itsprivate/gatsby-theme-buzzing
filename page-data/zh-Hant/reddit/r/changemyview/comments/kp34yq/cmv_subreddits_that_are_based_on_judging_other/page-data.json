Subscribing to these subreddits is filling your feed with harmful negativity that just isn&#39;t necessary, and likely leaves your mood worse off (even if just very slightly) with each post. </p>\n\n<p>Think for a moment why you&#39;re subscribed to these and ask yourself if it&#39;s really giving you any personal gain and benefit. If you think it does, change my mind. </p>\n\n<p>Also, I get that there sometimes can be a blurry line between laughing at idiots because what they did was genuinely funny, and laughing at them because their idiocy angers you. Like <a href=\"/r/IdiotsInCars\">r/IdiotsInCars</a> for example. I think the latter is what harms you. That is, if your interest is based on hate, anger, resentment or judgement.</p>\n\n<p>A few examples that I&#39;ve come across: <a href=\"/r/facepalm\">r/facepalm</a> , <a href=\"/r/entitledparents\">r/entitledparents</a> , <a href=\"/r/TumblrInAction\">r/TumblrInAction</a> , <a href=\"/r/LeopardsAteMyFace\">r/LeopardsAteMyFace</a>, <a href=\"/r/SelfAwarewolves\">r/SelfAwarewolves</a> , <a href=\"/r/MaliciousCompliance\">r/MaliciousCompliance</a>, <a href=\"/r/pettyrevenge\">r/pettyrevenge</a>, <a href=\"/r/im14andthisisdeep\">r/im14andthisisdeep</a> , some of <a href=\"/r/Cringetopia\">r/Cringetopia</a> </p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t think of any more examples right now, but I hope you understand to what kinds of subreddits I&#39;m talking about.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kp34yq/cmv_subreddits_that_are_based_on_judging_other/","title":"CMV: Subreddits that are based on judging other people, revenge and \"schadenfreude\" do you more harm than good and it would do us best if we all unsubscribed from them","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-03T04:53:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-03 04:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"39de4fce-bf89-5f3d-8059-3c42b7c83d97","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kp34yq/cmv_subreddits_that_are_based_on_judging_other/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kp34yq/cmv_subreddits_that_are_based_on_judging_other/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Unclear1nstructions","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Unclear1nstructions","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Unclear1nstructions","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：那些建立在评判他人、报复和“幸灾乐祸”基础上的低级红利对你弊大于利，如果我们都取消订阅，对我们来说是最好的。","the_new_excerpt":"它通常是关于白痴，粗鲁和卑鄙的人，凯伦的，\n约翰的，愚蠢的保守派，愚蠢的自由派，等等。任何类型的人\n激起你内心的仇恨和强烈的“我比他们强”或仅仅是八卦的感觉\n利息。\n\n不断关注人性的消极面可能会…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：那些建立在評判他人、報復和“幸災樂禍”基礎上的低級紅利對你弊大於利，如果我們都取消訂閱，對我們來說是最好的。","the_new_excerpt":"它通常是關於白癡，粗魯和卑鄙的人，凱倫的，\n約翰的，愚蠢的保守派，愚蠢的自由派，等等。任何類型的人\n激起你內心的仇恨和強烈的“我比他們強”或僅僅是八卦的感覺\n利息。\n\n不斷關注人性的消極面可能會…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-d560477f-422f-547a-8820-0fec0b745a81","excerpt":"Marijuana isn't some magical plant with no downsides I understand the risk of\npsychosis and obviously driving while inebriated under any circumstance is a bad\nidea.
