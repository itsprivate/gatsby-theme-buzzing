Or you&#39;re transphobic for not wanting to date a trans persson. People who throw out accusations or brandings like than are just shutting down the conversation and thus hurting their cause. If you approach someone with a threat, or accusation, or if you confront them then you&#39;re instantly putting them on the defensive and almost guaranteeing a worthless conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I should add some more examples.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Couples fighting or arguing, this often devolves into nothing more than a blame game or trying to &quot;win&quot; or &quot;one up&quot; their partner.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A simple case is couples using  &quot;I feel&quot; statements incorrectly. They say things like &quot;I feel you don&#39;t care about me and you always put yourself first&quot;. This is simply an attack that will likely put the other person on the defensive and it shuts down any conversation about how to resolve things.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kk3v5v/cmv_most_people_dont_know_how_to_properly/","title":"CMV: Most people don't know how to properly communicate, and don't care if they alienate others with how they talk.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"December 26, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-26T05:32:13.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-26 05:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"4f729b96-3430-5ead-8866-eb72b4923e64","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kk3v5v/cmv_most_people_dont_know_how_to_properly/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kk3v5v/cmv_most_people_dont_know_how_to_properly/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Environmental_Sand45","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Environmental_Sand45","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Environmental_Sand45","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：大多数人不知道如何恰当地沟通，也不在乎自己的说话方式是否会疏远他人。","the_new_excerpt":"这是我在现实生活中和网上每天都能看到的东西。\n\n我看到情侣吵架，朋友或家人吵架，\n尤其是人们在网上讨论事情的方式。\n\n这也是整个社会的一个主要问题，因为人们通常会变成\n极其封闭的…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：大多數人不知道如何恰當地溝通，也不在乎自己的說話方式是否會疏遠他人。","the_new_excerpt":"這是我在現實生活中和網上每天都能看到的東西。\n\n我看到情侶吵架，朋友或家人吵架，\n尤其是人們在網上討論事情的方式。\n\n這也是整個社會的一個主要問題，因爲人們通常會變成\n極其封閉的…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-8ed228a0-51cf-551d-90e9-54a48e1b310d","excerpt":"I’m in Denmark, this might be more or less applicable to different countries.\n\nI have a materialistic hobby: I like fashion.
