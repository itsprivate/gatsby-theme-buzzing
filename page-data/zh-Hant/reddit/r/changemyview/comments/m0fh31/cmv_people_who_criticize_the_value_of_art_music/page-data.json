I sometimes find comments in the social media that tell how useless art, fiction, and music are, and I often become devastated everytime I read them. I even once cried about it.

All videogames would be just simulations, all photos and videos would be only about documenting something, all books would be non-fiction and everyone would wear the same things and having the same objects. Art, music and storytelling is what made us humans different from other animals and without them all our lifes would be only about survive, working and calculating everything.
