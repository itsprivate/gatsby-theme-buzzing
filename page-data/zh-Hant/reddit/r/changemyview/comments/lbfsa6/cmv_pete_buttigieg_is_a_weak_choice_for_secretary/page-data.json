I can draw a straight line between him dropping out of the race before Super Tuesday and this nomination. </p>\n\n<p>Not to say someone can&#39;t have ambitions and that those ambitions can&#39;t relate to job security, but what on earth makes him a good transportation secretary?</p>\n\n<p>This seems more akin to Ben Carson as HUD Secretary - superficially nominated but unqualified.</p>\n\n<p>Seriously open to having my mind changed, somebody help me!</p>\n\n<p>p.s. I copied/pasted a good portion of this from the original post I referenced, but it&#39;s so far down a comment thread on an hours old post it won&#39;t get much traction. This has been eating at me a little though, to me it feels like a combo of identity and backroom politics has overridden actual qualifications - a feel-good nomination with little substance.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lbfsa6/cmv_pete_buttigieg_is_a_weak_choice_for_secretary/","title":"CMV: Pete Buttigieg is a weak choice for Secretary of Transportation","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T19:42:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 19:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"6c2f68e9-acde-5aca-9b81-b5fe3d79eb8b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lbfsa6/cmv_pete_buttigieg_is_a_weak_choice_for_secretary/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lbfsa6/cmv_pete_buttigieg_is_a_weak_choice_for_secretary/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"dan2872","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/dan2872","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"dan2872","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：皮特-布提吉格是交通部长的不二人选。","the_new_excerpt":"在另一个子上发了一个切入点的帖子，里面有一堆人跳上了Ted\n克鲁兹因为投票反对皮特-布提吉格让我思考，为什么人们认为皮特\n布提吉格是交通部长的好人选？\n\n先说一下，我投了拜登，我当然是民主党的左派，而且我是\n有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：皮特-布提吉格是交通部長的不二人選。","the_new_excerpt":"在另一個子上發了一個切入點的帖子，裏面有一堆人跳上了Ted\n克魯茲因爲投票反對皮特-布提吉格讓我思考，爲什麼人們認爲皮特\n布提吉格是交通部長的好人選？\n\n先說一下，我投了拜登，我當然是民主黨的左派，而且我是\n有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-5123b549-5364-5099-8cc7-0b7c5d4b3192","excerpt":"For this argument to work, omniscient minimally entails that this creator knows\nwhat will ever happen.\n\nHence the (*).\n\nCapable means that this creator can create as it wishes.\n\n1) Such a creator knows everything that will happen with every change it makes\nto its creation.
