If people shouldn’t “focus on getting a significant other, it won’t fix your life” then how come there are so many so-called ‘losers’ whose lives miraculously seem to get so much better once they have a significant other? I’ve seen people go from practically looking like bums all the time to suddenly dressing well, moving into new apartments, getting better jobs, and just overall becoming happier, more well-rounded, more interesting and positive people AFTER getting into a relationship. I think a lot of people would, in fact, benefit immensely from someone falling in love with them, caring for them and sharing some of life’s burdens with them. When you feel seen and someone is cheering you on and supporting you, your life DOES get better and I don’t know why there are so many people pretending like it won’t.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kqup7p/cmv_they_say_a_relationship_wont_solve_any_of/","title":"CMV: They say a relationship won’t solve any of your problems but literally every single person I know had a ‘glow up’ after finding a girlfriend and their lives all seem to be much better now.
