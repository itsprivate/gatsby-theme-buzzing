If short, of a short one; if long, of a long one. If it is his pleasure you should act a poor man, a cripple, a governor, or a private person, see that you act it naturally. For this is your business, to act well the character assigned you; to choose it is another’s.” \nExcerpt From - The Enchiridion - Epictetus </p>\n\n<p>This author talked about doesn’t need to be god or any deity it could be math, a percentage of people won’t find love and that’s a fact, you may be a part of that statistic. \nJust to make myself clear I’m not saying the opposite sex is to blame here, guys shouldn’t blame girls for their celibacy or vice versa, we’re all just playing our parts in the drama that is life.</p>\n\n<p>Effort may not even matter in some cases, you’ve just been dealt a bad hand, if everyone had a great hand poker would be boring. Just cuz you won’t have a partner, doesn’t mean you’re not destined to great things.</p>\n\n<p>Now for the “it’s not a bad thing part”, evolution depends on the undesirable traits not being passed, if everyone reproduces there is no progress, people won’t become prettier or smarter. You may think “how is that fair for the celibate person” and I answer you with “Does the rock that sits on the base of the mountain think it’s less important than the rock on the top” , without the rocks on the bottom there is no top, without losers there aren’t winners, so is life.</p>\n\n<p>And no I’m not an incel lol 😂, too young to be one anyway, have my whole life ahead and whatever destiny has stored for me, maybe that’s celibacy who knows.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Since it might not be clear what I’m trying to get challenged is “It’s not a bad thing because evolution depends on it”</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m50xbi/cmv_some_people_are_destined_to_not_find_love_or/","title":"CMV: Some people are destined to not find love or sex, and that’s not a bad thing.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-14T22:41:04.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-14 22:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"46567642-092d-574d-9869-7be956e2b8dc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m50xbi/cmv_some_people_are_destined_to_not_find_love_or/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m50xbi/cmv_some_people_are_destined_to_not_find_love_or/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Murky-Fennel2895","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Murky-Fennel2895","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Murky-Fennel2895","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：有些人注定找不到爱情和性，这不是一件坏事。","the_new_excerpt":"我很喜欢这句话来总结 \"记住，你是一个演员，在一个。\n戏剧，只要作者愿意，就可以做成这样。如果是短篇，则为短篇\n一；如果长，则长的。如果是他的乐趣，你应该表现出一个可怜的人，一个。\n瘸子，长官，或者私人，看你的行为... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：有些人註定找不到愛情和性，這不是一件壞事。","the_new_excerpt":"我很喜歡這句話來總結 \"記住，你是一個演員，在一個。\n戲劇，只要作者願意，就可以做成這樣。如果是短篇，則爲短篇\n一；如果長，則長的。如果是他的樂趣，你應該表現出一個可憐的人，一個。\n瘸子，長官，或者私人，看你的行爲... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-f0977499-2715-5e44-8f98-fe397fa66645","excerpt":"The mainstream view right now appears to be that due to the existence of people\nwho are born intersex or experience gender dysphoria, I should be teaching my\ntoddler that some people have penises and some people are boys but there's not\nnecessarily any relationship between those categories.\n\nIn my…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m4o8g4/cmv_i_should_teach_my_toddler_that_boys_have/","title":"CMV: I should teach my toddler that boys have penises and girls have vulvas/vaginas","date":"March 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：我应该教我的幼儿，男孩有阴茎，女孩有外阴/阴道。","the_new_excerpt":"现在的主流观点似乎是，由于人的存在。\n生来就是双性人或有性别分裂症的人，我应该教我的。\n蹒跚学步的孩子，有些人有阴茎，有些人是男孩，但有不\n必然是这些类别之间的任何关系。\n\n在我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：我應該教我的幼兒，男孩有陰莖，女孩有外陰/陰道。","the_new_excerpt":"現在的主流觀點似乎是，由於人的存在。\n生來就是雙性人或有性別分裂症的人，我應該教我的。\n蹣跚學步的孩子，有些人有陰莖，有些人是男孩，但有不\n必然是這些類別之間的任何關係。\n\n在我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-c8249ac2-6664-57ad-96c0-29dfd4ffc853","excerpt":"I got into a heated argument with a friend who just graduated from medical\nschool.
