But let me start off by saying I don&#39;t support Trump, and I don&#39;t support hate speech at all. I&#39;m not entirely clear of the full situation, but as I understand it most users on Parler were promoting hate speech and illegal activities while the moderation did not attempt to stop it.</p>\n\n<p>Trump has been banned from Twitter, Instagram, Twitch, etc. He has basically no online presence whatsoever anymore. A number of huge tech giants teamed up to ban him from all of their platforms. To a lot of people, it&#39;s a good thing because of his numerous provoking tweets. I&#39;m not aware of if he did the same on other platforms before being banned, so if he did please correct me. The problem is, a select few corporations together can basically prevent anyone from having any public social media presence if they reveal themselves. If, say, a civilian advocated strongly for things directly against those corporations and started to gain a bit of a following, enough to be deemed a threat, it is strikingly easy for those corporations to completely silence said person without even having to resort to more extreme measures.</p>\n\n<p>I acknowledge that this is similar to the past, in which if cable companies didn&#39;t like you, it was hard to have a widespread voice. But that doesn&#39;t make it any less of an issue, it was scary then and it&#39;s scary now. Except now, the internet is even more intertwined in our society and things have changed enough to almost require an internet presence. I&#39;m aware that corporations could also just (if you want to get into a conspiracy) hire an assassin or something, which I really don&#39;t think actually happens.</p>\n\n<p>For now, these tech giants silencing Trump and Parler is seen as a good thing, because a massive amount of people hate them, and because Trump incited some provocative thing. But just looking at the precedent this sets for the future, I think that&#39;s scary. I could bring this to a larger scope, that corporations have too much power in our society in general, but that&#39;s not fully the topic of this post.</p>\n\n<p>Please change my view if you want.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/l42vee/cmv_the_power_that_corporations_have_to_silence/","title":"CMV: The power that corporations have to silence people is scary.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-25T10:09:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-25 10:09","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e15ab648-fcb4-559d-9b27-bb8bad01e298","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l42vee/cmv_the_power_that_corporations_have_to_silence/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l42vee/cmv_the_power_that_corporations_have_to_silence/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"IAmATuxedoKitty","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/IAmATuxedoKitty","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"IAmATuxedoKitty","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：企业让人闭嘴的力量是可怕的。","the_new_excerpt":"诚然，这近乎于特朗普和帕勒几乎完全被清除了。\n从互联网上以有意义的方式。但让我先说一下，我并不\n支持特朗普，我也完全不支持仇恨言论。我不太清楚\n完整的情况，但据我了解，Parler上的大多数用户... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：企業讓人閉嘴的力量是可怕的。","the_new_excerpt":"誠然，這近乎於特朗普和帕勒幾乎完全被清除了。\n從互聯網上以有意義的方式。但讓我先說一下，我並不\n支持特朗普，我也完全不支持仇恨言論。我不太清楚\n完整的情況，但據我瞭解，Parler上的大多數用戶... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-a3ac77f7-e07b-50de-a9e2-07814b7614eb","excerpt":"Citizens United is one clear example of this.
