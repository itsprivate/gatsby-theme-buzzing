Latinos did not suffer from enslavement at the hands of Americans, they were just denied entry in the U.S. and ran into conflict with them through skirmishes, some colonization leading to citizenship (PR, etc.) and war (Mexico, etc.). So we can infer that the needs of Blacks need to be addressed, especially now that blacks can vote and have human rights granted to them by the government. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not Black nor American but it does bother me to see people make excuses to ignore black people problems like &quot;Okay, but what about all the other races?&quot;. What black people are saying is that their needs are not being met at all, not that they want to impose themselves above other races. But I feel like this message is being ignored and shut down on purpose to deny any responsibility for the damage done to blacks, who have suffered the most at the hands of Americans.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kx9uer/cmv_saying_all_lives_matter_in_response_to_black/","title":"CMV: Saying \"All lives matter\" in response to \"Black lives matter\" is just an excuse to deny the problems blacks in particular experience in the U.S.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-14T18:36:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-14 18:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"543c1fc4-f8d5-5813-b51e-ed4fa31f3c18","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kx9uer/cmv_saying_all_lives_matter_in_response_to_black/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kx9uer/cmv_saying_all_lives_matter_in_response_to_black/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"leechlamp","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/leechlamp","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"leechlamp","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：针对 \"黑人的生命很重要 \"说 \"所有人的生命都很重要\"，只是否认黑人在美国特别是经历的问题的借口。","the_new_excerpt":"你看，我知道人们需要平等对待，等等，但黑人已经遭受了\n比美国任何一个人都要受到种族主义的侵害。\n\n拉美人可能会受到美国种族主义者的歧视，但黑人是美国种族主义者。\n那些谁从他们的土地和奴役。拉美人没有遭受...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：針對 \"黑人的生命很重要 \"說 \"所有人的生命都很重要\"，只是否認黑人在美國特別是經歷的問題的藉口。","the_new_excerpt":"你看，我知道人們需要平等對待，等等，但黑人已經遭受了\n比美國任何一個人都要受到種族主義的侵害。\n\n拉美人可能會受到美國種族主義者的歧視，但黑人是美國種族主義者。\n那些誰從他們的土地和奴役。拉美人沒有遭受...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-87b3b26f-ad30-5e3a-af68-8fd0f759a4a8","excerpt":"When making an adaption of a book a limited series or recurring series for\nmultiple books.\n\nMost people agree that movie adaptations of books are usually sub par.
