Secondly, the child who is being abused now grows a sense of distrust toward authority, and can either end up more violent due to nothing to lose or developing depression because they don&#39;t feel safe.\n I&#39;m not calling for all kids to beat the living crap out of eachother but a middle ground needs to be found,  taking things at face value at the very least.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m5lpqt/cmvwe_need_to_stop_the_practice_of_teaching_our/","title":"CMV:We need to stop the practice of teaching our children confrontation is not okay.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-16T08:30:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-16 08:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"e8e5da17-6520-5f39-9e87-4ad58e3cec94","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m5lpqt/cmvwe_need_to_stop_the_practice_of_teaching_our/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m5lpqt/cmvwe_need_to_stop_the_practice_of_teaching_our/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"StolenDabloons","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/StolenDabloons","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"StolenDabloons","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV:我们需要停止教育孩子对抗是不行的做法。","the_new_excerpt":"我在Reddit/Facebook上看到的关于孩子如何被的帖子的次数\n欺凌，而学校实际上做的比什么都少，例如不处理。\n与所述欺凌，但实际上暂停两个学生，由于零。\n容忍政策的。这有两点，首先它说... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV:我們需要停止教育孩子對抗是不行的做法。","the_new_excerpt":"我在Reddit/Facebook上看到的關於孩子如何被的帖子的次數\n欺凌，而學校實際上做的比什麼都少，例如不處理。\n與所述欺凌，但實際上暫停兩個學生，由於零。\n容忍政策的。這有兩點，首先它說... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-79b82fe7-9b01-5180-aa7e-34c62bea9a36","excerpt":"With the tragic murder of Sarah Everard, the “defund the police” crowd have come\nto the forefront of grassroots politics again (first rearing their heads in the\n2020 BLM marches, several of which I attended).\n\nI’m fairly left wing, even sympathising with communism at times.
