All the ideals that make America as great as it is today are thanks to the Enlightenment, which was largely a secular movement. Many of the founding fathers (Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Madison, Monroe) were deistic, meaning they were not &quot;Christian&quot;. Jefferson literally wrote his own version of the Bible excluding all the supernatural bullshit and miracles.</p>\n\n<p>And if anything Christian fundamentalism has held our country back, and continues to do so to this day. People that think the earth is flat, that evolution isn&#39;t real, that bomb abortion clinics, that create gay conversion camps: they cause a demonstrable harm to our society.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing that throws a wrench into conservative notions of Christian ideals and American exceptionalism is that Eastern societies were far more advanced than the West prior to the Enlightenment. Our numerical system was developed by Hindus, and popularized by Arabs. Advancements like ink, paper, gunpowder, were all made in China. Baghdad, a Muslim city, was a hub for scientific and philosophical advancement. My point is that the Christianization of a civilization isn&#39;t correlated with the greatness of said society, and if anything it is negatively correlated. Another fact that exemplifies this is that South America is arguably more Christian/religious than the US and other European nations, but far less successful. </p>\n\n<p>I guess I just don&#39;t understand where conservatives get this idea that Christianity and its values are what make America, and the West great.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/layw70/cmv_secular_values_and_ideals_not_christian_ones/","title":"CMV: Secular values and ideals, not Christian ones, are to credit for American exceptionalism and the success of \"the West\" more broadly.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T18:03:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 18:03","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"55a9ccc2-cc66-5f85-9dad-9843f845462f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/layw70/cmv_secular_values_and_ideals_not_christian_ones/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/layw70/cmv_secular_values_and_ideals_not_christian_ones/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"rollingboulder89","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rollingboulder89","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rollingboulder89","score":130,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：世俗的价值观和理想，而不是基督教的价值观和理想，是美国特殊主义和 \"西方 \"更广泛成功的功劳。","the_new_excerpt":"像斯蒂芬-克劳德、本-夏皮罗和丹尼斯-普拉格这样的保守派专家声称\n是什么让美国和 \"西方 \"更广泛地，伟大的是犹太-基督教的。\n价值观。\n\n然而，个人主义、公民自由、民主、科学与理性... ... 全\n使美国像今天这样伟大的理想... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：世俗的價值觀和理想，而不是基督教的價值觀和理想，是美國特殊主義和 \"西方 \"更廣泛成功的功勞。","the_new_excerpt":"像斯蒂芬-克勞德、本-夏皮羅和丹尼斯-普拉格這樣的保守派專家聲稱\n是什麼讓美國和 \"西方 \"更廣泛地，偉大的是猶太-基督教的。\n價值觀。\n\n然而，個人主義、公民自由、民主、科學與理性... ... 全\n使美國像今天這樣偉大的理想... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ae993112-0015-522e-8229-2b8187f0a827","excerpt":"The following applies to creative works of any genre: music, literature, film,\netc. Most of my examples will be about literature.\n\nTo me, a creative work is good to the extent that it is enjoyable and/or to\nexperience or think about.\n\nI often hear arguments of the form: \"You may like it, but it is…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/laq777/cmv_i_have_no_reason_to_care_whether_a_creative/","title":"CMV: I have no reason to care whether a creative work is \"objectively\" good or bad beyond my own taste","date":"February 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：除了我自己的品味之外，我没有理由去关心一个创作作品 \"客观 \"的好与坏","the_new_excerpt":"以下适用于任何体裁的创作作品：音乐、文学、电影。\n等。我的大部分例子将是关于文学的。\n\n对我来说，一个创造性的作品，只要它是令人愉快的，和/或对\n经验或思考。\n\n我经常听到这样的争论 \"你可能会喜欢它，但它是... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：除了我自己的品味之外，我沒有理由去關心一個創作作品 \"客觀 \"的好與壞","the_new_excerpt":"以下適用於任何體裁的創作作品：音樂、文學、電影。\n等。我的大部分例子將是關於文學的。\n\n對我來說，一個創造性的作品，只要它是令人愉快的，和/或對\n經驗或思考。\n\n我經常聽到這樣的爭論 \"你可能會喜歡它，但它是... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-99d57521-ed3b-58c8-9756-9052fa84fc44","excerpt":"This all starts with the karma system.
