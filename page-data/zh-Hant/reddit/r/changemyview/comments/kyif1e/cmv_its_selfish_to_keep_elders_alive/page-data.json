It’s depressing this season with everything going on. I mainly deal with nursing homes. <em>I despise nursing homes.</em></p>\n\n<p>See, to me, nursing homes are elder jails. I haven’t been in a nursing home that ever treated their patients/residents right...</p>\n\n<p>But besides that, I feel that the elderly shouldn’t have to hold on to their last breath. I know that sounds terrible, but <em>is it?</em></p>\n\n<p>We keep these people here because WE (the family that are much youthful) don’t want to part from them in death. I feel that’s selfish. These elderly people are struggling every day, in aches and pain 24/7, ... basically walking lifeless people.</p>\n\n<p>I love my patients, don’t get me wrong. I just feel this whole nursing home and the families throwing them away (at least here. NO ONE visits their loved ones in the nursing homes. Maybe no less than twice a year...) are selfish and all for money to the people who run these homes.</p>\n\n<p>Why keep your loved one who lived a FULL life stay in a terrible “jail” for the rest of their last years? Change my mind about this because I’ve felt this strongly about this for years...</p>\n\n<p>Honestly glad my grandma passed away because I know that if we put her in a nursing home, <em>they’d kill her</em>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kyif1e/cmv_its_selfish_to_keep_elders_alive/","title":"CMV: It’s Selfish to Keep Elders Alive","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-16T14:56:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-16 14:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"0c0aeda6-4a4a-51bf-8e90-50ff42b5400f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kyif1e/cmv_its_selfish_to_keep_elders_alive/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kyif1e/cmv_its_selfish_to_keep_elders_alive/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"nappihead","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/nappihead","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"nappihead","score":86,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：让老人活着是自私的做法","the_new_excerpt":"我在医疗保健行业工作。这个季节发生的一切都让人沮丧。I\n主要是和养老院打交道。我鄙视养老院。\n\n你看，对我来说，养老院就是老年监狱。我还没进过养老院呢。\n曾经对待他们的病人/居民的权利... ...\n\n但除此之外，我觉得... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：讓老人活着是自私的做法","the_new_excerpt":"我在醫療保健行業工作。這個季節發生的一切都讓人沮喪。I\n主要是和養老院打交道。我鄙視養老院。\n\n你看，對我來說，養老院就是老年監獄。我還沒進過養老院呢。\n曾經對待他們的病人/居民的權利... ...\n\n但除此之外，我覺得... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-9630a6de-da82-5a2f-98f7-a33c78bef7cd","excerpt":"Pretty simple view.
