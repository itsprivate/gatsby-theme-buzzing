Why do countries like Canada have to foot their lavish bills whenever one of them shows up to shake hands and take pictures? </p>\n\n<p>I get that the UK may have some cultural reasons for wanting to uphold their royal family, but I don’t understand why their tax money needs to be poached in order to keep William’s wife in designer fashion. I would even suggest a donation fund where uk people and maybe even people who care about the royals abroad can contribute to so they can help upkeep the royal family if they so wish. </p>\n\n<p>My main sticking point is, we all know they’re racist. Princess Michael has been seen wearing “moor” inspired jewelry and heard making racist remarks. The recent interview is yet another glimpse into how they operate. And besides, as a person living in a former British colony, we don’t view them in a positive light. Some may ogle at the fashions, but we are all taught the slave trade and brutality of British colonization, and the general attitude seems to be very dismissive of the royals in large part because of this history. </p>\n\n<p>I just don’t believe the royals should be funded publicly when all the “working” royals do is charity work and visits, and that’s not a gap that can’t be filled if they were to stop. In fact, there’s zero reason they can’t continue their charity work (if indeed that’s what they’re passionate about) without taxpayer money. </p>\n\n<p>Someone change my view, because I feel like the UK is too sophisticated to uphold this.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: because people keep saying that when countries like Canada pay for them, it’s only security. Security alone didn’t cost Canada $43 million in 2015, and every time one of them gets married, the price of hosting, gifting, maintaining stately properties and entertaining that is done by the former-colonys’ governments shoot up. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/canadas-cost-to-support-the-royal-family-in-2015-2016-9\">https://www.businessinsider.com/canadas-cost-to-support-the-royal-family-in-2015-2016-9</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: people keep saying it’s just the standard to host dignitaries this way. It isn’t. The most Ottawa spent on a visiting dignitary was $491,000, and even that’s considered overboard. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.ca/amp/s/nationalpost.com/news/politics/ottawas-two-year-tab-to-host-visiting-kings-queens-presidents-and-prime-ministers-just-under-3-million/wcm/a7b2a7af-3031-454c-b165-a5a3edc0c2b9/amp/\">https://www.google.ca/amp/s/nationalpost.com/news/politics/ottawas-two-year-tab-to-host-visiting-kings-queens-presidents-and-prime-ministers-just-under-3-million/wcm/a7b2a7af-3031-454c-b165-a5a3edc0c2b9/amp/</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: this is a lot of great discussion!
