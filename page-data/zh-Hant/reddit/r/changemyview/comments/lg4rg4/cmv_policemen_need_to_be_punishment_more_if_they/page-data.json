I want to know if this is a valid view and not just some crazy thought. If a mod is reading this. I think its to short but i dont know how to explain it better. And i want feedback on it.</p>\n\n<p>So a Policemen is there to protect us and make sure the people follow the law. So for me i think it is much worse is a Policemen breaks the law than a normal citizen. When I see a post on the Internet of a Policemen breaking the law im dumbfounded. Even if it a mistake. That no excuse. But stil u see them speeding, on there phone when driving, tailgating, make bad traffic violations and many more thing. On or of duty. They should know better.</p>\n\n<p>My thing is if the people who are there to make sure everybody follows it law doesn&#39;t follow it himself. We can al just break them with no consequences. </p>\n\n<p>Its a dumb view to have but i dont know. Change my view.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: going to find so videos/post to show as examples of what i mean.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: my knowledge of reddit not so good. I would not know how to like a posts i could use as examples.</p>\n\n<p>Bad example but <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IdiotsInCars/comments/dti58l/this_is_definitely_next_level_sht/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\">https://www.reddit.com/r/IdiotsInCars/comments/dti58l/this_is_definitely_next_level_sht/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share</a></p>\n\n<p>Another bad example <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/iit3l2/whats_fucked_up_is_that_they_discovered_after/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/iit3l2/whats_fucked_up_is_that_they_discovered_after/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share</a></p>\n\n<p>There 100 ways you could&#39;ve done that better.</p>\n\n<p>I have no good luck finding good videos.
