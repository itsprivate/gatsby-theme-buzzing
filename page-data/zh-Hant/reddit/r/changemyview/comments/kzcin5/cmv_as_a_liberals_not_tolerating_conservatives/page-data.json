Case in point, me. I’m left leaning so I would identify as a liberal yet, I share beliefs with both conservatives and liberals. Someone that leans slightly more to the right would identify as a conservative and would be shunned by those people while differing from me by very little.</p></li>\n<li><p>Liberals are all about being tolerant to those with different views. Not tolerating someone with a different view goes against that.</p></li>\n<li><p>Regardless of the rationale, not tolerating each other contributes to the divide in the country.</p></li>\n<li><p>It doesn’t yield good results. I grew up Christian and was anti-LGBT. In my first year of uni my roommate was gay. I had lengthy debates with him. Throughout the year, neither he nor our common friends shunned me. I’ve come around since but, had they done that, I feel like it would have been much harder to change.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Edit: Added #4.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/kzcin5/cmv_as_a_liberals_not_tolerating_conservatives/","title":"CMV: As a liberals, not tolerating conservatives makes us not tolerant and contributes to the divide in the US.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"January 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-18T17:54:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-18 17:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"10cd9a21-ceca-58a0-8115-951a39ed1543","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kzcin5/cmv_as_a_liberals_not_tolerating_conservatives/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kzcin5/cmv_as_a_liberals_not_tolerating_conservatives/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"the_misc_dude","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/the_misc_dude","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"the_misc_dude","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[改变我的想法]：作为一个自由主义者，不能容忍保守派，使我们不能容忍，造成了美国的分裂。","the_new_excerpt":"我看这是一个非美国的左倾中间派。\n\n在最近不止一个关于Bumble允许人们按以下方式过滤的帖子中\n政治信仰，非美国人感到震惊的是，人们用政治信仰来过滤。\n信仰，却被人贬低，还让人辩解为什么连自己都不想要\n做朋友...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[改變我的想法]：作爲一個自由主義者，不能容忍保守派，使我們不能容忍，造成了美國的分裂。","the_new_excerpt":"我看這是一個非美國的左傾中間派。\n\n在最近不止一個關於Bumble允許人們按以下方式過濾的帖子中\n政治信仰，非美國人感到震驚的是，人們用政治信仰來過濾。\n信仰，卻被人貶低，還讓人辯解爲什麼連自己都不想要\n做朋友...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-18eb3f27-7df3-51a5-b882-59a1141185d0","excerpt":"If a relationship is unhealthy, it's unhealthy.
