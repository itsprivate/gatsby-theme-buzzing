Republicans will  fear-mongering to drive their policies and agendas, with very little basis in data. Democrats also focus heavily on pushing a &quot;fairness and equality&quot; narrative that drives their policies and agendas, oftentimes ignoring science and data that suggests better alternatives.  </p>\n\n<p>Why the flying fork are we not just using data and science to drive a lot of economic/policy decisions? Like, let&#39;s freaking invest $10 billion a year in just researching policy initiatives and then using the results to drive better decision making. It makes absolutely no sense to me. And yes, both sides of the aisle are guilty of this, though maybe one more than the other. Am I missing something here? </p>\n\n<p>Obviously, there are many good political reasons not to do this. So, those responses aren&#39;t going to CMV. I&#39;m more curious as to if there are other, non-political reasons why using more science and data isn&#39;t necessarily the best way to go.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lxpod5/cmv_politicians_need_to_have_a_stronger_emphasis/","title":"CMV: Politicians need to have a stronger emphasis on data and science and a smaller emphasis on feelings/emotions to drive policy and lawmaking.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-05T04:32:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-05 04:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"99807efa-5050-572c-a785-618d0c6cb2d2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lxpod5/cmv_politicians_need_to_have_a_stronger_emphasis/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lxpod5/cmv_politicians_need_to_have_a_stronger_emphasis/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"DwightUte89","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DwightUte89","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"DwightUte89","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：政治家需要更加强调数据和科学，而较少强调感情/情绪来推动政策和立法。","the_new_excerpt":"我认为这是两边的系统性问题。共和党将\n恐惧主义来推动他们的政策和议程，但几乎没有任何依据。\n的数据。民主党人还十分注重推行 \"公平和平等\"\n驱动其政策和议程的叙事，往往忽略了... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：政治家需要更加強調數據和科學，而較少強調感情/情緒來推動政策和立法。","the_new_excerpt":"我認爲這是兩邊的系統性問題。共和黨將\n恐懼主義來推動他們的政策和議程，但幾乎沒有任何依據。\n的數據。民主黨人還十分注重推行 \"公平和平等\"\n驅動其政策和議程的敘事，往往忽略了... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-49123291-5d3c-58b1-be1c-9cb96b635420","excerpt":"Proof: The Dark Knight: 84 Metascore Black Panther: 88 Metascore\n\nThe Dark Knight: 9.0 IMDb score, #4 highest rated film on entire site Black\nPanther: 7.3 IMDb score\n\nThe Dark Knight: 94% on BOTH critic and audience scores Black Panther: 96%\ncritic score, 79% audience score\n\nThe Dark Knight: won 2/8…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lxvovm/cmv_black_panther_was_only_nominated_for_best/","title":"CMV: “Black Panther” was only nominated for Best Picture due to specific social relevance and not based on quality.","date":"March 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：《黑豹》获得最佳影片提名只是因为具体的社会关联性，而不是基于质量。","the_new_excerpt":"证明。《黑暗骑士》： 84 Metascore Black Panther: 88分\n\n黑暗骑士》：IMDb评分9.0分，全场最高分第4名，黑\n黑豹 7.3 IMDb评分\n\n黑暗骑士》：影评人和观众评分均为94%《黑豹》。96%\n批评家评分，79%观众评分\n\n黑暗骑士：赢了2/8... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：《黑豹》獲得最佳影片提名只是因爲具體的社會關聯性，而不是基於質量。","the_new_excerpt":"證明。《黑暗騎士》： 84 Metascore Black Panther: 88分\n\n黑暗騎士》：IMDb評分9.0分，全場最高分第4名，黑\n黑豹 7.3 IMDb評分\n\n黑暗騎士》：影評人和觀衆評分均爲94%《黑豹》。96%\n批評家評分，79%觀衆評分\n\n黑暗騎士：贏了2/8... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-c869627c-f31e-59b4-8c17-5407ef6e4efb","excerpt":"Large corporations are largely responsible for the middle class disappearing.
