I called them sexist and part of the problem, and they said they don&#39;t believe you can be sexist to the group with power. Looking back, I over-reacted and got too angry, and they don&#39;t actually hate or want to kill men.</p>\n\n<p>I still disagree with #killallmen , because I believe it hurts the feminist movement. Men can be feminists too and saying this alienates some from joining. I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s a joke and men shouldn&#39;t get angry at it, but I feel like if we want to stop toxic masculinity and tell men that their emotions are valid, if they are offended by generalisations about them, we should respect that. </p>\n\n<p>Some feminists told me that the men who were going to judge the whole movement by the actions of a few, they never wanted to join in the first place. That these men are the problem, rather than people saying #killallmen. I agree that these men are a problem, but I also don&#39;t see how that means I have to be okay with feminists saying #killallmen either. I can dislike two things at the same time. If you don&#39;t like men judging the whole feminism movement based on the actions of a few, you shouldn&#39;t judge all men based on the actions of some men. So I think they&#39;re both part of the problem.</p>\n\n<p>I was told that it is punching up rather than punching down and therefore it&#39;s okay. But even though women aren&#39;t killing men en masse, men are still getting killed by other men and dying from work-related incidents at a much higher rate than women are, they also die at a younger age than women. This explanation ignores the fact that there are a few things men are disproportionately affected by.</p>\n\n<p>I also feel like statistics and facts, such as &quot;1 out of 6 American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape&quot;, are much better at raising awareness. Why make <em>untrue</em> hyperbolic statements, like all men are bad, when the <em>actual</em> statistics are shocking enough without hyperbole or exaggeration?</p>\n\n<p>I have also heard that #killallmen and misandrist statments are said out of frustration and as a form of venting, and I can understand it&#39;s frustrating, but I see that as an explanation rather than an excuse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>This</em> is the post I made before that sparked me to make this cmv. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/lkalii/how_do_you_deal_with_killallmen_people/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\">https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/lkalii/how_do_you_deal_with_killallmen_people/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/llr6kz/cmv_it_is_counterproductive_for_feminists_to_say/","title":"CMV: It is counter-productive for feminists to say #killallmen and punching up is still punching","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-17T17:37:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-17 17:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ac41583d-f7f2-59ec-b238-4e2d2e72d33d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/llr6kz/cmv_it_is_counterproductive_for_feminists_to_say/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/llr6kz/cmv_it_is_counterproductive_for_feminists_to_say/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"New_Secretary_861","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/New_Secretary_861","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"New_Secretary_861","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：女权主义者说#killallmen，打起拳来还是打起拳来，这是适得其反的。","the_new_excerpt":"作为一个女人，当我的朋友们说他们同意的时候，我真的很生气\n#killallmen，他们说，因为男人已经压迫妇女多年，\n复仇是合理的。我说他们是性别歧视者，是问题的一部分，而他们... ...\n说，他们不相信你可以对有权力的群体进行性别歧视....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：女權主義者說#killallmen，打起拳來還是打起拳來，這是適得其反的。","the_new_excerpt":"作爲一個女人，當我的朋友們說他們同意的時候，我真的很生氣\n#killallmen，他們說，因爲男人已經壓迫婦女多年，\n復仇是合理的。我說他們是性別歧視者，是問題的一部分，而他們... ...\n說，他們不相信你可以對有權力的羣體進行性別歧視....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-fee60b26-76d3-5a74-8973-ac33d6c0516b","excerpt":"The average news article sometimes seems to list a bunch of stats based on the\nwriter's research and knowledge, which is great, but I feel like seeing more\nvisual data would allow people to\n\n 1. become more data fluent (which I feel average people are lacking),\n 2. understand the issue at hand as…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/llcvwc/cmv_pretty_much_all_news_articles_should_have/","title":"CMV: Pretty much all news articles should have more charts, infographics, and visualized data.","date":"February 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：几乎所有的新闻文章都应该有更多的图表、信息图和可视化的数据。","the_new_excerpt":"一般的新闻文章有时似乎会列出一大堆统计数字，依据是\n作家的研究和知识，这是伟大的，但我觉得看到更多的。\n可视化数据将使人们能够\n\n 1.变得更懂数据（我觉得一般人都缺乏）。\n 2.把眼前的问题理解为......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：幾乎所有的新聞文章都應該有更多的圖表、信息圖和可視化的數據。","the_new_excerpt":"一般的新聞文章有時似乎會列出一大堆統計數字，依據是\n作家的研究和知識，這是偉大的，但我覺得看到更多的。\n可視化數據將使人們能夠\n\n 1.變得更懂數據（我覺得一般人都缺乏）。\n 2.把眼前的問題理解爲......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-a27b813f-d09a-5224-a9f6-d731fe2f7d82","excerpt":"Organized religion, specifically the main three monotheistic religions\n(Christianity, Islam, and Judaism) cause more harm than good to human society\nand individual people.\n\nReligion causes conflict between people.
