I have about 4-5 years in food delivery experience but haven’t worked in the field much since the proliferation of food delivery apps. </p>\n\n<p>In short, I think that food delivery apps are bad for the main constituent groups of the app experience: the customer, the driver, and the restaurant. The only group I see coming out on top are the food delivery apps. Who, especially in the age of COVID, I have to imagine are making gobs of money. </p>\n\n<p>Having been in several local and chain restaurants recently picking up my food (I almost always just drive and do the delivery myself when eating at home), I have noticed an uptick in clogged lines of delivery drivers impatiently waiting on orders, stressed staff, and can only imagine the frustrated customers waiting on the other end.</p>\n\n<p>So, the way I see it, everyone is having a bad experience. Specifically,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>The customer</strong>:  Delivery fees for these apps are pretty high in addition to the expectation of tipping. I certainly can understand paying for the convenience of delivery, but with the additional margin that a massive company has to inject into the ordering process, I just wonder if the value of the convenience of an app and the huge selection really equals the premium paid. This, and the extra delivery time, especially during peak meal times. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The restaurant</strong>: I don’t have numbers for this, but I do know (and, correct me if I’m wrong) that the restaurant makes less money on orders running through these apps, in addition to the up charge for the delivery itself. So the restaurant is making less money on orders, and their facilities are clogged with impatient delivery drivers waiting on orders. Furthermore, having worked on the delivery end of things, I know that restaurants typically have to streamline operations for delivery and make sense of things like delivery radius and the number of drivers in order to ensure the highest chance that the food comes on time and is still hot / cold. With a third party app (or several) I can only imagine that gluts of orders coming in might throw things askew. Furthermore, without drivers / bikers in-store to help out with things like bagging orders, cleaning, doing simple food prep, additional work falls on the kitchen staff, further backing things up and causing stress in the kitchen.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The driver</strong>: I personally think that the anonymity of going around from restaurant to restaurant can fray the patience and forbearance that can develop between drivers and kitchen staff when the restaurant has in-house delivery. I have observed drives that were very terse with restaurant staff, and from the driver’s perspective, I get wanting to deliver food on-time and get a good tip / review, but when you have no knowledge of the restaurant / how busy it is, you suddenly realize you’re wasting your time, and losing money. There’s also all the dubious legal standing of “independent contractors” and all that, which, drivers for restaurants weren’t making minimum wage but they at least easily made it up with tips (and it’s been many years since I’ve been an in-house delivery driver so this may have changed). There’s also the issue of wear and tear on a car. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I guess that’s kind of disorganized, but I’ve tried to cover some of the high level thoughts I’ve had on this. Overcharged customers, underpaid restaurants, stressed drivers. </p>\n\n<p>I’m willing to change my view only because I can see the benefit of offering people choices, and don’t disparage people making choices to purchase legal products and services. I’m sure that driving can be a flexible way of making money, and if people (either consumers, restaurants, or delivery drivers) have had a consistently good experience working with / for / buying from one of these companies, I’d be interested to hear in what ways they’re a net positive.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
