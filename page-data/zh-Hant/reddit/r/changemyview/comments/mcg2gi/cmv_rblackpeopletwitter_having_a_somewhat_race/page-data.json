Even if the majority of Reddit is white doesn’t mean that comments will turn into white supremacy rants. If someone is being racist than I would imagine they would get reported or downvoted into oblivion.</p>\n\n<p>I also don’t understand why they separate Twitter of all things based on race. It just seems like a strange thing to focus on. <a href=\"/r/whitepeopletwitter\">r/whitepeopletwitter</a> doesn’t verify you or anything, you can say what you want there. Both are about the same content like promoting left wing policies with some racial topics which is fine, it’s what Twitter does so it makes sense that that is the content. </p>\n\n<p>The weirdest thing to me though is if you ever go to verify, you have to pick if you are </p>\n\n<p>A. Black\nB. A non white person of color\nC. A White ally</p>\n\n<p>If all end up with the same result of being given access to post and comment, why is there a need for distinction in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>It all just seems unnecessarily discriminatory and I don’t think it’s the right mindset for things as common as Twitter posts that could be about anything. I have no problem with subreddits that are meant to talk about issues a race or gender have to deal with unique challenges and issues having some sort of system like they have, I’m just not sure that Twitter account subreddits are the place for it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/mcg2gi/cmv_rblackpeopletwitter_having_a_somewhat_race/","title":"CMV: r/blackpeopletwitter having a somewhat race based verification process and having subreddits for specific races does more harm than good","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-25T06:33:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-25 06:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"54ac5427-5449-5523-9ad5-c7e40776c253","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mcg2gi/cmv_rblackpeopletwitter_having_a_somewhat_race/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mcg2gi/cmv_rblackpeopletwitter_having_a_somewhat_race/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"CanaryWorking1144","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/CanaryWorking1144","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"CanaryWorking1144","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：r/blackpeopletwitter有一个有点基于种族的验证过程，并有特定种族的子reddits，弊大于利。","the_new_excerpt":"就像标题说的那样，我算是明白他们的来意了\n但它弊大于利。即使Reddit的大部分是白人，也不。\n意味着评论会变成白人至上主义的狂言。如果有人被\n种族主义者比我想象的要多，他们会被举报或下架... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：r/blackpeopletwitter有一個有點基於種族的驗證過程，並有特定種族的子reddits，弊大於利。","the_new_excerpt":"就像標題說的那樣，我算是明白他們的來意了\n但它弊大於利。即使Reddit的大部分是白人，也不。\n意味着評論會變成白人至上主義的狂言。如果有人被\n種族主義者比我想象的要多，他們會被舉報或下架... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-72fbd663-d774-5a28-b44f-260af6f4749a","excerpt":"You can read about the drama here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/mbzggv/why_has_r_gone_private\n\nThe tl;dr is that reddit's newest admin, a woman named Aimee Challenor, lived in\nthe same house as her father while he raped and tortured a child over 10 days\nfor which he was convicted,…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/mccjeg/cmv_the_ongoing_aimee_challenor_drama_is_a_good/","title":"CMV: The ongoing Aimee Challenor drama is a good enough reason to leave reddit forever.","date":"March 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：正在进行的Aimee Challenor戏剧是一个足够好的理由，永远离开reddit。","the_new_excerpt":"你可以在这里阅读有关戏剧的内容。\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/mbzggv/why_has_r_gone_private\n\ntl;dr是reddit最新的管理员，一个叫Aimee Challenor的女人，住在...\n在她父亲强奸和折磨一个孩子10天的时候，她和父亲住在同一个房子里。\n他因此被判刑，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：正在進行的Aimee Challenor戲劇是一個足夠好的理由，永遠離開reddit。","the_new_excerpt":"你可以在這裏閱讀有關戲劇的內容。\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/mbzggv/why_has_r_gone_private\n\ntl;dr是reddit最新的管理員，一個叫Aimee Challenor的女人，住在...\n在她父親強姦和折磨一個孩子10天的時候，她和父親住在同一個房子裏。\n他因此被判刑，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-1c938d6c-2d06-59f4-8857-5a5dd3bd60e2","excerpt":"Based on Regent Law Professor James Duane's best-selling book on the same\nsubject, You Have the Right to Remain Innocent.\n\nBy law, a prosecutor can see to it that nothing you tell the police is used in\ncourt to help you.
