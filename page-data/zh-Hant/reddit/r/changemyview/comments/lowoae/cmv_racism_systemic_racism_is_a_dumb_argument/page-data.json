Which is ironic to think about it but let&#39;s move ahead.</p>\n\n<p>My wife has encountered this argument a lot in social media , be it Twitter , facebook or instagram.</p>\n\n<p>Basically it boils down to this, and I&#39;ll try to reformulate it in premises and conclusions.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Racism is a system of oppression it is not prejudice against race.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore there is no Reverse Racism because the system does not oppress white people.</p>\n\n<p>And also black people can&#39;t be racist because they do not hold any power in this system.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>My problem is this , whenever you use racism in the real world , you are probably not referring to the system but to racial prejudice. Almost no one in the real world when they talk about racism are talking about the system , they are talking about actions people took that denigrate someone based on race.</p>\n\n<p>So when a black person is berated for being black let&#39;s say by a costumer in a store , they can respond with &quot;You are being racist&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>The problem comes with the fact that if your definition of racism is that it is a system , than no one can be racist. If racism applies only when it is a system than you cannot label anyone racist because a person is not a system.</p>\n\n<p>What these people refer to as racism , I call Systemic racism , and then the argument can follow logically:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Systemic Racism is a system of oppression it is not prejudice against race.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore there is no Reverse Systemic Racism because the system does not oppress white people.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>There is a phrase used by Matt Dillahunty(Atheist/Skeptic community) - &quot;Words don&#39;t have meaning , they have usages&quot; , so my point is that when you define Racism as only Systemic racism, you are actually subverting the common usage of the word to fit your narrative.</p>\n\n<p>And I&#39;ll go further to inflame things a bit.</p>\n\n<p>This argument is equivalent to &quot;Nazism is a left-wing movement&quot; in the sense that Right wingers use this argument in order to take the label of Nazism off of anything regarding the right, The same way that people use the argument above to say that Reverse Racism does not exist and that black people cannot be racist.</p>\n\n<p>/discuss</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lowoae/cmv_racism_systemic_racism_is_a_dumb_argument/","title":"CMV: \"Racism = Systemic Racism\" is a dumb argument","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-21T15:36:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-21 15:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"01cb0f05-39df-5776-9e20-0f6ed9b0270b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lowoae/cmv_racism_systemic_racism_is_a_dumb_argument/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lowoae/cmv_racism_systemic_racism_is_a_dumb_argument/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"krysak","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/krysak","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"krysak","score":106,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：\"种族主义=系统性的种族主义 \"是一个愚蠢的论点。","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，首先要做的是。\n\n我是黑人 ，让我说出来的蝙蝠，因为肯定有人判断\n其他人在这个问题上从人的种族开始。这是很讽刺的\n想了想，还是先说说吧。\n\n我老婆在社交媒体上经常遇到这种争论 ，无论是微博...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：\"種族主義=系統性的種族主義 \"是一個愚蠢的論點。","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，首先要做的是。\n\n我是黑人 ，讓我說出來的蝙蝠，因爲肯定有人判斷\n其他人在這個問題上從人的種族開始。這是很諷刺的\n想了想，還是先說說吧。\n\n我老婆在社交媒體上經常遇到這種爭論 ，無論是微博...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-bac16954-59b7-52c2-98b0-91a5fa2b49a1","excerpt":"I think this belief is held in many peoples minds already.
