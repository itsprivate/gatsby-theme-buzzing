Let&#39;s see you keep that same energy next time a terrorist attack happens and you&#39;re screaming &quot;Not all Muslims&quot;</p>\n\n<p>To clarify I think both are legitimate arguments. It&#39;s the hypocrisy I hate. Why should I be held accountable for the crappy actions of a few people. I&#39;ve seen a lot of people using the &quot;not all sharks eat people&quot; argument to try to discredit the &quot;not all men argument&quot;, however this argument doesn&#39;t hold up. Yeah sure not all sharks eat people. So it&#39;s on you to learn to tell the signs of which sharks do eat people so that you can avoid them. If you&#39;re too scared to swim in water that have non man eating sharks in then that&#39;s on you. You shouldn&#39;t expect the non man eating sharks to change their behaviour to suit you.  In the same way you should look for the signs that somebody is gonna be a bad apple and avoid them. Don&#39;t expect the good apples to change for you.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: this is in regards to men saying &quot;not all men&quot; in response to being held accountable of rapists actions. Not being accused of rape. Please make this distinction before you reply. I know no women say all men are rapists but a lot say it&#39;s up to all men to stop it. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: Damn the man haters really came out in force thinking I somehow support rape. I&#39;m just saying these arguments are both as legitimate as each other. You can&#39;t say one and discredit the other. They are both generalizations.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m4btcb/cmv_saying_not_all_men_are_rapists_when_women/","title":"Cmv: Saying \" Not all men are rapists\" when women call out men as a group, is as legitimate a response as saying \"Not all Muslims are terrorists\" when Muslims get called out as a group after a terrorist attack.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-13T20:30:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-13 20:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"95ac1424-150f-59d4-bea9-ddf4d385ffc3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m4btcb/cmv_saying_not_all_men_are_rapists_when_women/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m4btcb/cmv_saying_not_all_men_are_rapists_when_women/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"waterjugmarathon","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/waterjugmarathon","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"waterjugmarathon","score":64,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Cmv：当女性作为一个群体呼唤男性时，说 \"不是所有的男人都是强奸犯\"，就像在恐怖袭击后穆斯林作为一个群体被呼唤时说 \"不是所有的穆斯林都是恐怖分子 \"一样合法。","the_new_excerpt":"在英国看到很多女性（最近事件发生后）发帖说这是不对的\n说 \"不是所有的男人\"。好了，好了 让我们看到你保持同样的能量下一次一个\n恐怖袭击发生后，你就大喊 \"不是所有穆斯林\"\n\n要说明的是，我认为这两种说法都是合理的。我讨厌的是虚伪....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Cmv：當女性作爲一個羣體呼喚男性時，說 \"不是所有的男人都是強姦犯\"，就像在恐怖襲擊後穆斯林作爲一個羣體被呼喚時說 \"不是所有的穆斯林都是恐怖分子 \"一樣合法。","the_new_excerpt":"在英國看到很多女性（最近事件發生後）發帖說這是不對的\n說 \"不是所有的男人\"。好了，好了 讓我們看到你保持同樣的能量下一次一個\n恐怖襲擊發生後，你就大喊 \"不是所有穆斯林\"\n\n要說明的是，我認爲這兩種說法都是合理的。我討厭的是虛僞....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6b0c5aa9-0cf0-5f46-a676-9fa2ed4dcabf","excerpt":"Let me preface this by saying I am not a staunch advocate for integrative\nmedicine.
