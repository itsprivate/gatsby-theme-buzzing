If you don&#39;t feel like clicking the article I linked to, here&#39;s the bit that I really want to focus on:</p>\n\n<p><em>Harvard and Yale—two of the world’s most prestigious institutions—actively</em> <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/06/23/a-lawsuit-reveals-how-peculiar-harvards-definition-of-merit-is\"><em>discriminate against Asians</em></a><em>. Once controlling for variables, Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Radford showed Asians face odds</em> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691141606/manhattaninstitu/\"><em>multiple</em></a> <a href=\"https://asianamericanforeducation.org/en/issue/discrimination-on-admissions/\"><em>times</em></a> <em>higher than other groups to be accepted to elite colleges.</em> </p>\n\n<p>I won&#39;t say that this is the first time I&#39;ve heard of this because it&#39;s not, and I won&#39;t say that I am categorically opposed to considering other factors that &quot;merit&quot; in college admissions because I am not.   But what really got me thinking how they hell is whether or not someone is &quot;Asian&quot; any kind of factor, at all?</p>\n\n<p>Something like <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/237584/distribution-of-the-world-population-by-continent/#:%7E:text=As%20of%202020%2C%20about%2059.51,total%20population%20by%20continent%20here\">60% of the entire population</a> of the world lives in Asia.  Are we supposed to believe that  someone from Bangladesh, a country with a per capita income of less than $5000 per annum should be measure by the same standards as someone of Japanese decent, a country that has one of the highest standards of living in the world?</p>\n\n<p>And what is an Asian?  I&#39;ll bet if you looked at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmyks#/media/File:Kirsan_Ilyumzhinov_2014.jpg\">this guy</a>, you&#39;d say, &quot;Yep, that is an Asian person!&quot;  You would be wrong he is European.  And indigenous to European Russia at that. OK, what about <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Ksenia_Sukhinova#/media/File:MissWorld_2008_(cropped\">this person</a>.jpg)?  She&#39;s a native of Asia, born at the same longitude as New Delhi. </p>\n\n<p>So, would someone please tell me how Asian can be used as a standard for anything?  You can find people of every race, religion, socio-economic group, political affiliation, and skin tone living in Asia!</p>\n\n<p>Yes, I know that on average people of Asian extraction (60% of the world) do quite well in America.  Do you think that matters to people from Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Bangladesh, who are immigrating to escape abject poverty?</p>\n\n<p>This just goes to show how utterly arbitrary race is and why parental income is a much better factor to take into account in admitting people to prestigious educational institutions.  </p>\n\n<p>Change my view.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/mcy9s2/cmv_discriminating_against_asians_in_educational/","title":"CMV: Discriminating against \"Asians\" in Educational Admissions is the Height of Ignorance and Stupidity","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-25T17:49:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-25 17:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"64adaedd-6b22-5d87-ad8b-10296aec8ae1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mcy9s2/cmv_discriminating_against_asians_in_educational/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mcy9s2/cmv_discriminating_against_asians_in_educational/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"bluepillarmy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bluepillarmy","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"bluepillarmy","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：教育招生中歧视 \"亚裔 \"是无知和愚蠢的高度。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我在读这篇文章\n[https://quillette.com/2021/03/24/anti-asian-discrimination-is-real-and-an-attack-on-american-values/]\n我发现自己的感觉绝对是一塌糊涂的事实\n亚裔美国人在教育方面受到歧视。如果你不觉得\n像点击...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：教育招生中歧視 \"亞裔 \"是無知和愚蠢的高度。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我在讀這篇文章\n[https://quillette.com/2021/03/24/anti-asian-discrimination-is-real-and-an-attack-on-american-values/]\n我發現自己的感覺絕對是一塌糊塗的事實\n亞裔美國人在教育方面受到歧視。如果你不覺得\n像點擊...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-02dec5d0-1519-5ff9-bb01-4a803bea62bb","excerpt":"I've seen conservatives on Twitter trying to invoke the 25th Amendment after a\nclip of Joe Biden at the end of a press conference \"looking confused\" and the\nstaffers asking the reporters to leave.\n\nI don't think Kamala Harris, potentially the first female president getting to\nthat office would be…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/mcx6dv/cmv_the_first_woman_president_getting_there/","title":"CMV: The first woman president getting there because of the 25th Amendment is not a good look for female empowerment.","date":"March 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：第一位女总统因为第25条修正案而到达那里，这对女性赋权来说并不是什么好事。","the_new_excerpt":"我在推特上看到一些保守派人士试图援引第25条修正案，在一次事件后\n乔-拜登在新闻发布会结束时 \"一脸茫然 \"的片段，以及在。\n工作人员要求记者离开。\n\n我不认为卡马拉・哈里斯， 潜在的第一个女总统 得到的。\n该办公室将是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：第一位女總統因爲第25條修正案而到達那裏，這對女性賦權來說並不是什麼好事。","the_new_excerpt":"我在推特上看到一些保守派人士試圖援引第25條修正案，在一次事件後\n喬-拜登在新聞發佈會結束時 \"一臉茫然 \"的片段，以及在。\n工作人員要求記者離開。\n\n我不認爲卡馬拉・哈里斯， 潛在的第一個女總統 得到的。\n該辦公室將是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-2861340c-f344-58cd-87d0-ef2b4f6d9822","excerpt":"I'm not talking about when someone is abusing you or these third world contries\nwhere women are basically forced to marry men they don't love.
