Denzel Washington, Will Smith, Sam Jackson, Morgan Freeman, Halle Barre to just name a few.   </p>\n\n<p>i feel like nowadays you don&#39;t see many nonwhite actors in leading roles in blockbusters. It&#39;s almost always in movies about race relations or something.   </p>\n\n<p>I think this is cause of comic book movies. Almost all blockbusters are from the same franchise that was created more than half a century ago. Furthermore a lot of other movies are remakes from old movies or historical tales.   </p>\n\n<p>In short: I believe that there is a general lack of original storytelling that prevents stories from being told that would represent the current population and diversity. Where is the action thrillers, sceince fiction stories, crime thrillers or comedies etc that many nonwhite actors got big with?   </p>\n\n<p>Basically what I&#39;m saying is that if Hollywood wasn&#39;t so obsessed with remakes and adapting known stories then there would be less of a diversity problem.<br/>\nCMV</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/mdo0bh/cmv_90s00s_movies_had_more_and_better_minority/","title":"CMV: 90's/00's movies had more and better minority representation than todays movies","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-26T14:42:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-26 14:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"f5abc9af-41fc-50e1-a96b-f985fc167546","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mdo0bh/cmv_90s00s_movies_had_more_and_better_minority/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mdo0bh/cmv_90s00s_movies_had_more_and_better_minority/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"zuluportero","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/zuluportero","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"zuluportero","score":400,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：90/00年代的电影比现在的电影有更多、更好的少数族裔代表。","the_new_excerpt":"那段时间，很多著名的黑人演员都处于事业的高峰期。\n丹泽尔-华盛顿、威尔-史密斯、萨姆-杰克逊、摩根-弗里曼、哈莉-巴雷等等。\n举几个例子。\n\n我觉得像现在你没有看到很多非白人演员在领导角色在\n大片。它几乎总是在电影中关于... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：90/00年代的電影比現在的電影有更多、更好的少數族裔代表。","the_new_excerpt":"那段時間，很多著名的黑人演員都處於事業的高峯期。\n丹澤爾-華盛頓、威爾-史密斯、薩姆-傑克遜、摩根-弗里曼、哈莉-巴雷等等。\n舉幾個例子。\n\n我覺得像現在你沒有看到很多非白人演員在領導角色在\n大片。它幾乎總是在電影中關於... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-4864e05c-3616-5fad-83f4-26aacebcdc6d","excerpt":"I realized I might be biased in this, as someone who has serious medical issues.\nI’ve been unbelievably irritated by diet and nutrition advice over the years,\nand have always felt it could be potentially dangerous — so I just wanted to get\nthat out in the open.\n\nI’ve heard eating healthier can…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/mdloqk/cmv_most_nutrition_claims_are_bspseudoscientific/","title":"CMV: Most Nutrition claims are bs/pseudoscientific","date":"March 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：大多数营养声称都是错误的/伪科学的。","the_new_excerpt":"我意识到，作为一个有严重医疗问题的人，我在这一点上可能有失偏颇。\n多年来，我一直对饮食和营养建议感到无比恼火。\n并一直觉得这可能是潜在的危险 - 所以我只是想得到。\n那在开放。\n\n我听说吃得健康可以... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：大多數營養聲稱都是錯誤的/僞科學的。","the_new_excerpt":"我意識到，作爲一個有嚴重醫療問題的人，我在這一點上可能有失偏頗。\n多年來，我一直對飲食和營養建議感到無比惱火。\n並一直覺得這可能是潛在的危險 - 所以我只是想得到。\n那在開放。\n\n我聽說喫得健康可以... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-e80edf57-95c0-58de-885b-197eea26c684","excerpt":"Edit: It’s come to my attention that there’s a difference between polyamory and\nopen relationships.
