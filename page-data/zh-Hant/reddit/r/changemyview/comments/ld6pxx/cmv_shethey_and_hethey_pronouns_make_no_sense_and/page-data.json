It makes no sense. All the people I met who use she/they pronouns said something like, &quot;but I don&#39;t really fit into the stereotypes of a girl so I don&#39;t think I&#39;m fully a girl&quot; and that&#39;s sexist and wrong because it is enforcing gender stereotypes. A lot of them also call themselves trans or part of the LGBT community when they literally haven&#39;t even changed their gender, they just use an extra pronoun. Even straight girls are claiming using she/they makes themselves part of the LGBT community. This is harmful to those who are actually in the LGBT community and it should not be encouraged.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ld6pxx/cmv_shethey_and_hethey_pronouns_make_no_sense_and/","title":"cmv: She/they and he/they pronouns make no sense and the people who use them just want to feel special.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T18:44:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 18:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"01c51f75-40e0-5c15-aee7-33a80ec9bd14","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ld6pxx/cmv_shethey_and_hethey_pronouns_make_no_sense_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ld6pxx/cmv_shethey_and_hethey_pronouns_make_no_sense_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"-Parasitic-","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/-Parasitic-","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"-Parasitic-","score":60,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"cmv：She/they和he/they这两个代词毫无意义，使用它们的人只是想让人觉得自己很特别。","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，让我把话说明白。\n\n她/她的代词=用户认定为女性。\n\n他/他代词=用户自认为是男性。\n\nThey/them代词=用户认为自己是非二元的。\n\n一个人怎么可能没有性别，但同时又有性别呢？这使得\n没有意义。我遇到的所有的人...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"cmv：She/they和he/they這兩個代詞毫無意義，使用它們的人只是想讓人覺得自己很特別。","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，讓我把話說明白。\n\n她/她的代詞=用戶認定爲女性。\n\n他/他代詞=用戶自認爲是男性。\n\nThey/them代詞=用戶認爲自己是非二元的。\n\n一個人怎麼可能沒有性別，但同時又有性別呢？這使得\n沒有意義。我遇到的所有的人...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-683ad265-8878-5fbe-861c-e50ebe661471","excerpt":"Let me start by saying that I am a black man.
