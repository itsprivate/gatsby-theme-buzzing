The incidence of ambiguous genitals is a rounding error, not a reason to throw away a simple and useful system of categorization. My toddler is learning the absolute basics of the world, not training to be a medical doctor. Obscure medical conditions are not relevant to the basic topic of what boys and girls are. To illustrate, some people are born with one leg, or no legs at all, but I&#39;m still going to tell her that people have two legs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Because this is the Internet, some people are going to ignore my substance of my reasoning and declare the entire topic transphobic or something.
