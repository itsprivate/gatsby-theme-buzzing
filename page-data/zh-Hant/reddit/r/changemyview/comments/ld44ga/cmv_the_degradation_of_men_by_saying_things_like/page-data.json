The reasoning that I&#39;ve seen behind this is because the person may have had a negative experience with men, so they they generalize about all men and hold this negative opinion on men as a whole. I find this to be completely counter-intuitive and making the problem worse.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, this is akin to someone saying they were attacked by a person of color, and now they are apprehensive of people of color, but with this situation it would be deemed completely unacceptable to say something like this and you would be deemed a racist.
