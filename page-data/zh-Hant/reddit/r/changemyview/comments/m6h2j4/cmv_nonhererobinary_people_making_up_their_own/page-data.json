People making up their own prefixes is throwing the preverbial at the wall and expecting something to stick. I know the only solution is to have a meeting of the council of the gays to decide on concrete terminology, but nothing to that effect is likely, and until we have a common understanding, people will have to make do with “They/Them/Their” or keep making up silly-sounding words to describe themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Are my thoughts silly, insensitive or incorrect?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/m6h2j4/cmv_nonhererobinary_people_making_up_their_own/","title":"CMV: Non-Herero/Binary people making up their own pronouns is damaging to the community.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T03:30:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 03:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"0edec433-b535-5c42-be39-a50e955eba10","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m6h2j4/cmv_nonhererobinary_people_making_up_their_own/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m6h2j4/cmv_nonhererobinary_people_making_up_their_own/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"_hancox_","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/_hancox_","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"_hancox_","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：非Herero/二元人自己编造代词对社区有损害。","the_new_excerpt":"我得到了男性和女性，和跨代词。我得到了非二元的喜欢\n\"他们/他们/他们\"，直到我们能找到更合适的东西，但整个...\n\"Flee/Fler/Flem \"这个东西没有意义。把随机的字母放在 \"Flee/Fler/Flem \"前面\n\"ee/er/em \"后缀让选择它们的人很难接受...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：非Herero/二元人自己編造代詞對社區有損害。","the_new_excerpt":"我得到了男性和女性，和跨代詞。我得到了非二元的喜歡\n\"他們/他們/他們\"，直到我們能找到更合適的東西，但整個...\n\"Flee/Fler/Flem \"這個東西沒有意義。把隨機的字母放在 \"Flee/Fler/Flem \"前面\n\"ee/er/em \"後綴讓選擇它們的人很難接受...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e4886ce6-18f2-5bfd-a55c-602a26e60c1f","excerpt":"I think that if your work does not require direct contact with customers or\nworking in person with a physical product, you should be allowed to work from\nhome or at least be allowed a flex schedule where you can go into the office, if\nneeded.
