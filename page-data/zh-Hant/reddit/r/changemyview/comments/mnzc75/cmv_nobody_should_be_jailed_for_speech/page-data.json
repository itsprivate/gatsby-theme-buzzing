I think this is an affront to human rights, and is immoral. </p>\n\n<p>Now, I think everything Chabloz has said is absolutely evil, ideologically possessed, and intellectually dishonest. However, jailing anyone for saying mere words is reprehensible. </p>\n\n<p>Firstly, it gives legitimacy to conspiracy theorists like say, Richard Spencer who believe the Jews rule the world. Hiding ridiculous arguments from the air of conversation and debate only allows them to grow unchecked in the shadows, after all, if you cannot discuss something openly without fear of legal reprisal you cannot defeat an awful idea. For example, in the Sargon of Akkad Vs Richard Spencer debate, the latter was revealed to be a ridiculously dishonest person who advocated for hereditary rule, a fact not many including myself would have known about.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, who exactly decides what is imprisonable? In this case it is the UK government, which historically has jailed people over tweets, Instagram posts, and YouTube videos, as well as a recent case of a man being arrested for calling a politician a Nazi. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/6147024/man-arrested-nicola-sturgeon-nazi-covid-funeral/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/6147024/man-arrested-nicola-sturgeon-nazi-covid-funeral/amp/</a></p>\n\n<p>This was the first source I could find, sorry, the sun isnt my first love either. </p>\n\n<p>So clearly the government should not decide. It opens the door to corruption and selective prosecution.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I believe free speech is a human right. No government or mob should have the authority to tell you what you may and may not say. </p>\n\n<p>The only exception I can think of would be, basically some of the exceptions in the US, such as fraud, speech integral to illegal conduct, speech which incited imminent illegal action (ie standing in a crowd of say protestors or rioters, and yelling the suggestion of breaking windows or burning a building), defamation which causes harm to reputation and tangible damage to your person among a few others. </p>\n\n<p>However, saying you hate a group of people, saying a historic event didn&#39;t happen (speaking of which - no one has been jailed in the UK for claiming the Armenian genocide, or the gulags, or the killing fields, &quot;great leap forward&quot;, ongoing Uyghurs genocide, etc didnt happen or is just &quot;capitalist propaganda&quot; as far as I know), or any manner of disgusting or hateful things, should not be an offense under the law. To summarize, I believe it is a trait of only authoritarian or fascist governments, a violation of human rights, and opens the door to corruption and selective prosecution. I am open go having my view changed, however I won&#39;t be able to respond to all or even most comments. Again, I am not making this post to promote the incorrigible Ms Chabloz, but rather to address the idea that hurting someones feelings should be a legal offense.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
