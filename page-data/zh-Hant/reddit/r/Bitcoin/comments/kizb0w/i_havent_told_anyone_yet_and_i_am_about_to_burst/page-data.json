For the crypto people in my life, they are all sitting on shit coins and bag holding.  So I havent told them because I dont want them to feel bad.  And for the rest of the people i know, they are struggling and on unemployment etc .   So i cant really go &quot;hey buddy guess what i finally made it, even though you never will&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Long story short I have been a bitcoin millionaire for about a week.   became a millionaire before i hit age 40, which was a goal of mine.   I am so excited and happy and have really no one to share this with.   </p>\n\n<p>Kind of just want to briefly tell my Journey in bullet format</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2015 bought my first coins.  Immediately sent them to a ponzi scam and lost them</li>\n<li>2016 Was trading Alt coins and investing Ponzis.  Lost about 29 btc total so far in my Jouney</li>\n<li>2017 Sold all 20 of my remaining bitcoin at $2500.  immdiatly became suicidal when it went to 4k with no pull back.  I bought back in with 8 btc</li>\n<li>from 2017 onwards, i had BTC PTSD.  Was depressed and going crazy.  Decided to become a minimalist.  Quit smoking weed (for a year).  Quit buying guitars and other crap i didnt need.   Started cooking my own food.   Spent every penny of my paycheck I could on bitcoin.  dollar cost averaging, buying the dip, taking out loans during the bear market, working 2 jobs, working overtime.   Spending every second of my day looking at the chart.</li>\n<li>2018-2020 -every day I purchased bitcoin.  Somedays $1, other days a couple grand.  birthday money went to bitcoin.  christmas money went to bitcoin.  Never sold a single sat.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This post wasnt really meant to brag, got no where to go but strangers on the internet.  Hopefully it inspires someone to realize it still isnt too late for you to do the same thing</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kizb0w/i_havent_told_anyone_yet_and_i_am_about_to_burst/","title":"I havent told anyone yet and I am about to burst","tags":["Bitcoin","reddit"],"date":"December 24, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-24T07:34:34.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-24 07:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kizb0w","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kizb0w/i_havent_told_anyone_yet_and_i_am_about_to_burst/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kizb0w/i_havent_told_anyone_yet_and_i_am_about_to_burst/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bitcoin","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin","author":"Infinite_Emergency82","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Infinite_Emergency82","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Infinite_Emergency82","score":281,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我还没有告诉任何人，我快要崩溃了","the_new_excerpt":"因为各种原因被扔掉。我没有告诉很多人我藏了\nBTC。对于我生活中的密码人来说，他们都坐在狗屎硬币上\n拿着袋子。所以我没有告诉他们，因为我不想让他们感觉不好。而对于\n我认识的人的睡觉，他们正在苦苦挣扎，在…上","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我還沒有告訴任何人，我快要崩潰了","the_new_excerpt":"因爲各種原因被扔掉。我沒有告訴很多人我藏了\nBTC。對於我生活中的密碼人來說，他們都坐在狗屎硬幣上\n拿着袋子。所以我沒有告訴他們，因爲我不想讓他們感覺不好。而對於\n我認識的人的睡覺，他們正在苦苦掙扎，在…上","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kiwnpn","excerpt":"Anonymous account for obvious reasons but I wanted to share my story.\n\nEdit: I was making 18k per year while working construction in 2012 because I had\ntrouble finding work in my field of study.
