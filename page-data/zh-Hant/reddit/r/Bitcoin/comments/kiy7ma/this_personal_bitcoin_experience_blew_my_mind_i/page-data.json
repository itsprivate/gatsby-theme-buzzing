I educated then on security and backup.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the holidays I contacted them and causally mentioned the bitcoin price.</p>\n\n<p>I told them to open there wallet and look at todays value. They all went up 20-40x.  One person sent me a screenshot, it showed the value of when they originally received it, $37.66, and the value currently which is $1,764.70.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgbox.com/tDLgCtyS\">https://imgbox.com/tDLgCtyS</a></p>\n\n<p>The part that blew my mind despite all of them having a much greater value than original( making substantial profit), NONE where interested.  They acted like it&#39;s no big deal. They had absolutely no interest in investing more (even though they easily can, they aren&#39;t homeless, etc...)  Even when I mentioned they can have bitcoin in their RRSP (kinda like a 401k in US) their eyes got a little bigger, then back to same size.</p>\n\n<p>So these people saw with their own eyes and money and are still not interested.</p>\n\n<p>One person came into an inheritance of about $100k, he said he invested all in stocks (advice from financial advisor) and DOES NOT WANT ANY MORE IN BITCOIN. (his original investment was maybe $1000)he was almost aggressive with me, he did not want to invest another penny in bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>THAT BLEW MY FUCKIN MIND!!!</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m drinking tonight.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kiy7ma/this_personal_bitcoin_experience_blew_my_mind_i/","title":"This personal bitcoin experience blew my mind.
