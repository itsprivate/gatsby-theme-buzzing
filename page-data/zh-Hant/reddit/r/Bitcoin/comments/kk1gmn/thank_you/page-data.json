First thank you to this community I’ve learned so much from reading posts. I’m a young farmer in the Midwest, I’m sure that theirs not many of us here lol. I first heard of Bitcoin in 2014 but didn’t think much of it. At that time I had over leveraged my self with the local bank buying cattle, machinery and other farm inputs. The night I got married at 26 y/o I had to tell my wife you are now in debt $600,000+. Long story, shortly after that the farming markets across the board had tanked and I was forced to sell almost all I had to just pay on my loans. I was defeated so I did the only thing I’ve ever done and worked my ass off 3 or 4 jobs at a time. I installed fiber optic internet cables. General Electrician and ran heavy equipment for other people for fractions of the money I was making when I was “self employed” all at the same time continuing to work on the family farm. This is the first year our money has been somewhat stable. Came back to reading about Bitcoin in February of this year and started DCA. Thanks to this community for all the advice. I’m not the most tech savvy person but was able to guide my self where I feel confident in my Bitcoin decisions, because of all your help and advice, this is a valuable community to people like me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bitcoin/comments/kk1gmn/thank_you/","title":"Thank you","tags":["Bitcoin","reddit"],"date":"December 25, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-25T20:30:44.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-25 20:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kk1gmn","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kk1gmn/thank_you/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kk1gmn/thank_you/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bitcoin","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin","author":"roymizz","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/roymizz","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"roymizz","score":201,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"谢谢","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，只是想分享一下。首先感谢我了解到的这个社区\n从阅读帖子中学到的东西太多了。我是中西部的一个年轻农民，我相信\n我们在座的人不多，呵呵。我第一次听说比特币是在2014年，但没有\n好好想一想。那时候，我在…上过度利用了自己","locale":"zh"},{"title":"謝謝","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，只是想分享一下。首先感謝我瞭解到的這個社區\n從閱讀帖子中學到的東西太多了。我是中西部的一個年輕農民，我相信\n我們在座的人不多，呵呵。我第一次聽說比特幣是在2014年，但沒有\n好好想一想。那時候，我在…上過度利用了自己","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kjzvcf","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kjzvcf/trading_volume_on_binance_exceeded_a_record_3/","title":"Trading Volume On Binance Exceeded A Record $3 Trillion Year To Date","date":"December 25, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"今年到目前为止，Binance的交易量超过了创纪录的3万亿澳元","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"今年到目前爲止，Binance的交易量超過了創紀錄的3萬億澳元","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-kjzsww","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kjzsww/less_than_a_week_left_till_the_grand/","title":"Less than a week left till the Grand Dickening/Pussing Out.
