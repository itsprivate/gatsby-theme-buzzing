各种历史性的股市泡沫。

在他的文章…中]]></description><link>https://reddit.buzzing.cc/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ktu07v/why_we_are_at_the_major_latestage_bubble_possibly/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://reddit.buzzing.cc/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ktu07v/why_we_are_at_the_major_latestage_bubble_possibly/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 20:41:17 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I begin, I came across this article written by Jeremey Grantham, who is a British investor and co-founder and chief investment strategist of GMO, also regarded as a highly knowledgeable investor particularly due to his prediction of various historic stock market bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his article titled &amp;quot;Waiting for the Last Dance&amp;quot;, he outlines multiple points why he thinks we are in a major late-stage bubble. I will summarize below the key points discussed, but will also leave a link to the article in case you want to read the full version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/&quot;&gt;https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The long, long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble, and he believes this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history along with the South Sea bubble, 1929, and 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The single most dependable feature of the late stages of the great bubbles of history has been really crazy investor behaviour, especially on the part of individuals. For the first 10 years of this bull market, we lacked such wild speculation. But now we have it. (he provides examples such as Hertz, K*d*k, Nikola, and especially, Tesla)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The &amp;quot;Buffett indicator,&amp;quot; total stock market capitalization to GDP, broke through its all-time-high 2000 record. In 2020, there were 480 IPOs (including an incredible 248 SPACs) – more new listings than the 406 IPOs in 2000. There are 150 non-micro-cap companies (market cap of over $250 million) that have more than tripled in the year, which is over 3 times as many as any year in the previous decade. The volume of small retail purchases, of less than 10 contracts, of call options on U.S. equities has increased 8-fold compared to 2019, and 2019 was already well above long-run average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- This time, more than in any previous bubble, investors are relying on accommodative monetary conditions and zero real rates extrapolated indefinitely ... Now once again the high prices this time will hold because…interest rates will be kept around nil forever, in the ultimate statement of moral hazard – the asymmetrical market risk we have come to know and depend on. The mantra of late 2020 was that engineered low rates can prevent a decline in asset prices. Forever! But of course, it was a fallacy in 2000 and it is a fallacy now. In the end, moral hazard did not stop the Tech bubble decline, with the NASDAQ falling 82%. Yes, 82%!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Nothing in investing perfectly repeats. Certainly not investment bubbles. Each form of irrational exuberance is different; we are just looking for what you might call spiritual similarities. Even now, I know that this market can soar upwards for a few more weeks or even months – it feels like we could be anywhere between July 1999 and February 2000. Which is to say it is entitled to break any day, having checked all the boxes, but could keep roaring upwards for a few months longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- My best guess as to the longest this bubble might survive is the late spring or early summer, coinciding with the broad rollout of the COVID vaccine. At that moment, the most pressing issue facing the world economy will have been solved. Market participants will breathe a sigh of relief, look around, and immediately realize that the economy is still in poor shape, stimulus will shortly be cut back with the end of the COVID crisis, and valuations are absurd. “Buy the rumor, sell the news.” But remember that timing the bursting of bubbles has a long history of disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Even with hindsight, it is seldom easy to point to the pin that burst the bubble. The main reason for this lack of clarity is that the great bull markets did not break when they were presented with a major unexpected negative. The great bull markets typically turn down when the market conditions are very favorable, just subtly less favorable than they were yesterday. And that is why they are always missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The combination of timing uncertainty and rapidly accelerating regret on the part of clients means that the career and business risk of fighting the bubble is too great for large commercial enterprises. So, don&amp;#39;t wait for the Goldmans and Morgan Stanleys to become bearish: it can never happen. For them it is a horribly non-commercial bet. Perhaps it is for anyone. Profitable and risk-reducing for the clients, yes, but commercially impractical for advisors. Their best policy is clear and simple: always be extremely bullish. It is good for business and intellectually undemanding. It is appealing to most investors who much prefer optimism to realistic appraisal, as witnessed so vividly with COVID. And when it all ends, you will as a persistent bull have overwhelming company. This is why you have always had bullish advice in a bubble and always will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested to see more of his arguments, I strongly advise you to go and read the full article. I am currently 100% on equities, and very bullish for stocks as all of you probably are. But I think it&amp;#39;s also important to have a balanced perspective, especially when everyone around you is extremely bullish. Ultimately, we are investing for the long run for our retirement. Everyone is a fucking genius in a bull market, and I think a lot of people in the sub, whether a newcomer or an experienced investor, should listen to bearish predictions and advices and not become a victim of confirmation bias.&lt;/p&gt;

Big Tech are the only companies in America that virtually have absolute immunity from being sued for their actions, and it’s only because Congress gave them that protection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current market has some obvious similarities with the internet bubble in the 2000s at the moment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Sectoral bubble&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric Vehicle stocks, Renewable energy stocks, crypto and possibly even fintech stocks have skyrocketed to insane levels in 2020. A PE ratio of 100-200 for stocks in these sectors is considered &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; right now, that&amp;#39;s what &amp;quot;investors&amp;quot; before the dotcom crash thought aswell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Historic low interest rates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest catalyst for the creation of an insane bubble, very low interest rates. Just like in the 2000s, we currently have historic low interest rates, which makes stocks the only game in town. The big myth here is that people think stocks only go up, with interest rates close to 0. That&amp;#39;s absolutely not true and that&amp;#39;s the scary part in my opinion, because even professionals and analysts think that. The market doesn&amp;#39;t stay disconnected from the economy forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) IPO mania and speculation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven&amp;#39;t seen more IPO&amp;#39;s in 2020 since the dotcom bubble. This on itself isn&amp;#39;t a big deal, but the valuations these IPO&amp;#39;s get are beyond insanity. Any company that gets linked to EV in some way, automatically gets a 100%+ boost to their stock price, without even having a product or sales number. 1999 all over again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &amp;quot;New paradigm&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s be honest, at least 80% of the people in any financial subreddit (excluding WSB, +-99% there) thinks that Tesla is the new paradigm that will take over the world. Trust me, it is not. I&amp;#39;ve been doing some math on Tesla valuation, and I have no fitting word for its current valuation. I won&amp;#39;t go in the details why, because I could write a whole book about this. I still firmly believe that growing positive cashflows should be the main catalyst of a stock that goes up, and a company with a negative cashflow (THAT ONLY GROWS AT A 25% RATE) shouldn&amp;#39;t get a 1t valuation, that&amp;#39;s too disrespectful for companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Greed and FOMO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to jump on this train, no one wants to miss out, but I can assure you, these valuations are absurd and those who can&amp;#39;t get out early enough, will be left holding the (empty) bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind regards and stay safe (physically and financially)&lt;/p&gt;

I flip back and forth on whether or not we actually are in the midst. Prices are obviously high, probably overvalued in some obvious cases, but interest rates are low, the Fed keeps on buying, stimulus keeps pumping, and major companies do seem to indeed be making decent piles of money. But on a purely psychological-level, when everyone is saying we are in a bubble makes me think we aren’t actually – historically bubbles happen when everyone turns a blind-eye to excessive rises in asset prices. People aren’t turning a blind-eye yet, in fact everyone keeps making claims and saying be cautious. So I think in a contrarian sense prices will continue to rise for the short- and medium- term at least until sentiment shifts and everyone begins to think that this is all normal and BAU again. We aren’t there yet. There’s possibility of external factors coming into play: shutdown risk (I personally believe this risk is low), no future stimulus (low again), etc. Then again, I may be the one making that BAU case, only time will tell...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck in 2021 everyone and stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s merging with UWM, or United Wholesale Mortgage - which is an established company with revenue, something that is not super common with the companies that SPACs merge with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the company GHIV is merging with, UWM, released earnings on Jan. 6. Earnings are also expected to be released this year before the merger vote on the 20th, and are expected to show good growth from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the merger, GHIV is disgustingly low for a SPAC so close to merging at only ~35% from NAV. It jumped up last month but was brought down last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware that this sub does not like riskier plays like SPACs, but I really do think that UWM is a solid company with established revenue that could be a long term hold. I bought options, but I think the best decision for a long term hold if you believe in this company is shares.&lt;/p&gt;

The yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen from 0.93% at the beginning of December to above 1%. That means that since August of last year, when the 10-year yield hit 0.5%, interest rates have more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been looking at the 30y treasury bill rate and it seems like it is getting close to 2%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are a few reasons why this is important for investors. Firstly, it means debt is more expensive. For both the U.S. government and corporate borrowers, the cost of borrowing money is rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many analysts expect interest rates to continue to increase over the next year as a normal part of the economic cycle. When the economy is improving, it is essential to increase interest rates in order to avoid inflation spiralling out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased economic stimulus and borrowing could drive rates higher, and while this would be positive for many companies on a fundamental level, it is bound to hit equity valuations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the risks investors need to be aware of as interest rates continue to grind higher. In past market downturns, it wasn&amp;#39;t as much of a concern, but this time around we have seen the rather unique phenomenon of a stock market bull run during a major global economic recession, which puts quite a different spin on things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial markets often do what we least expect as the highest probability scenarios are already priced in, and that&amp;#39;s where I believe we stand today, with a majority of investors pricing in lower for longer on the interest rate front, which is evidenced by the euphoric price action in the large-cap growth stocks, including recent heavily oversubscribed shares of initial public offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, commodity prices are signaling that we are on the cusp of higher than expected future inflationary pressures. This could very well lead to the specter of a burst broader equity market bubble and a burst bond market bubble that potentially casts a pall over the broader investment landscape?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts about where is this going? I have been under the impression that the Fed will keep the interest rate low for many years but this seems contradict to what’s happening. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company originally planned to go public in December but delayed its debut after DoorDash and Airbnb soared more than expected out of the gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol &amp;quot;RBLX.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roblox said on Friday in an updated prospectus that it plans to go public through a direct listing next month, after the online game company delayed its debut in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Roblox disclosed that it raised $520 million in a private financing round ahead of a direct listing. By taking this route to the public markets instead of a traditional IPO, Roblox is following Spotify, Slack, Palantir and Asana, sidestepping a share sale and instead allowing existing stakeholders and employees to sell stock to new investors right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest funding round, at $45 a share, valued Roblox at $29.5 billion. In the updated filing, Roblox said an independent valuation report in December placed the shares at $41.52 apiece. By raising some money before going public, Roblox was able to pad its balance sheet and preserve the ability to bring in more capital through a secondary sale later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the direct listing, the NYSE will set a reference price for the stock the night before Roblox&amp;#39;s debut, but no shares will be traded at that price. In the morning, the market makers will match buyers and sellers to determine the opening price and the stock will be available to the broader market under the ticker symbol &amp;quot;RBLX.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roblox had been considering a more traditional IPO, but tabled its plans last month after DoorDash and Airbnb popped on consecutive days, leading to concern that the company risked leaving too much money on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Due to market volatility and the performance of other recent underwritten initial public offerings, we have elected to file this prospectus as an amendment to the registration statement and pursue a direct listing to permit determination of the opening public price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers,&amp;quot; Roblox said in the prospectus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s not doing an IPO, Roblox no longer requires underwriters. The company said Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will stay on as financial advisers, but JPMorgan, Bank of America and RBC Capital Markets were removed from the filing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roblox, which first released its service in 2006, is hitting the public market following a year of dramatic growth as kids, who were forced to stay home during the pandemic, spent more time playing games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the third quarter jumped 91% from a year earlier to $242.2 million. Daily active users almost doubled in the period ended September to 36.2 million and &amp;quot;hours engaged&amp;quot; more than doubled to 8.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Roblox&amp;#39;s app, users create an avatar that they can move between millions of different games. They&amp;#39;re all free to play, but users buy virtual currency called Robux for advanced features or to build their character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The games are created by outside developers, who share the revenue with Roblox. The company said in the updated filing that in the first three quarters of 2020, the platform had about 3,800 developers, who earned $215 million. That&amp;#39;s up from a year earlier, when 2,400 developers made $72.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many game creators cash out into real world currency, &amp;quot;some choose to reinvest their Robux into developer tools, promote their experiences through our internal ad network, or spend the Robux as any other user would,&amp;quot; the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/q9trn69923a61.png?width=604&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8dba759a31f158fba12b097991e6aae44f5d03ad&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/q9trn69923a61.png?width=604&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8dba759a31f158fba12b097991e6aae44f5d03ad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a reference to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/en/&quot;&gt;Signal Messaging App&lt;/a&gt; (which by the way is not publicly traded).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unrelated company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SIGL/overview&quot;&gt;OTCMKTS:SIGL&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.signaladvance.com/&quot;&gt;Signal Advance&lt;/a&gt;) saw it&amp;#39;s stock rise by 526.67% over the course of the day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tldhx00c23a61.png?width=525&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=31ebe8d7526ba1b43a1f97c745f7beec4397fdbb&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/tldhx00c23a61.png?width=525&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=31ebe8d7526ba1b43a1f97c745f7beec4397fdbb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s amazing is that SIGL isn&amp;#39;t even available on RobinHood, so it wasn&amp;#39;t us retards that bid it up. If any of you 🌈🐻 have access to OTC markets, you probably want to short SIGL.&lt;/p&gt;
